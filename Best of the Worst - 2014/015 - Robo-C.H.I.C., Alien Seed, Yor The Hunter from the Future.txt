[Jay and Josh are standing outside with their winter gear on, Josh is sticking his arms out like a scarecrow, Jay is rubbing his palms]
Jay: Ah, fuck, it’s cold! [Lowers Josh’s arms, they go back up by themselves(?)]
Josh: Oh, my joints are frozen
J: Oh. Shit. So, Josh, it’s really fucking cold in Wisconsin right now, uhh…[Looks past the camera at Mike] What--what--what’s the temperature?
[Mike’s hand appears, holds his phone up to the camera, it says Local Weather: -13°]
JH(?): Oh…
J: What the hell are we doing out here?
JH: I don’t even know anymore
J: Well, we gotta get our movies. We’re gonna take our minds off of all this, by watching some, uh, otherworldly movies, some sci-fi films
JH: Oh
J: Uh, so the first movie we have here is….[Opens the dumpster behind him, leans in and takes out a VHS tape] “Robo-Chick” [Shows Josh the tape] Although, technically it’s “Robo-Chic”, but I think it’s supposed to be “chick.” [Reads the back] “The perfect woman is not the perfect weapon”
JH: Oh
J: “A madman is holding the world hostage for a billion dollars!”
JH: Wow! That’s--a lot of money…
J: Ugh, “chaos and violence rule the streets. Enter Robo-C.H.I.C.”
JH: Thank God
J: “A Computerized Humanoid Intelligent Clone,” that’s the chick, “an unstoppable killing machine packed into one of the hottest bodies around” [They chuckle] “The ultimate crime fighter, she’s faster than a laser beam, more powerful than an atom bomb, and able to wipe out ten men with a single blast from her ion shooting orbs”
JH: I wonder what that could mean!
J: “The challenge: can this bodacious bombshell wipe out the bad guys, save the world, fall in love, and get her hair done all in the same day?”
JH: Ohhh nooo
J: So this is a--a over-the-course-of-one-day movie like, uh, uh, Dazed and Confused, OR! It keeps going. There’s so many things going on in this film
JH: Oh god
J: “Or will the vicious scum take over the Earth and get all of the great-looking babes?” [They laugh, Josh claps, Jay bows(?)]
JH: Oh my god, let’s go watch this fucking movie
J: Holy shit!
JH: It’s cold out here, we could be watching Robo-C.H.I.C.

[2:26] Jack: So that’s the associate producer right there?
J: Yeah
JH: Yup
[Robo-CHIC’s boobs show up]
J: That’s both the associate producers
JK: Damn, dog!
J: That was a boob joke!

[2:43] J: They’re not even trying anymore! [Jack howls with laughter]
JK: Ohhhh. Beer makes everything better
[Robo-CHIC pushes two quarrelling men offscreen]
[Everyone explodes with laughter]
J: She hasn’t given up. “We got ten minutes to shoot this scene….we don’t need choreography, just walk up to ‘im and--[Waves his arms]
Mike: “Slightly push them away”
J: “Slightly push them out of the shot!”

[3:16] [Outside]
J: Well, let’s see what else we can find in here
JH: Ok
J: [Opens the dumpster and pulls another tape out] Oh, wonderful! Uh, this is Alien Seed!
JH: Oh!
J: Which, the trailer for this played before Elves and we immediately had to get it [Gives Josh the tape]
JH: Wow! It stars Erik Estrada!
J: Yes
JH: “Alien Seed, they invaded the planet and violated our women!”
J: Oh no!
JH: “Can the Alien Invasion be stopped?!” question mark, exclamation point [Turns the tape over] “From an ancient prophecy...to an alien conception……..….the future of the world lies within an unborn child. Mary Jord-on, an innocent eighteen-year old student, finds herself unexplainably impregnated after being dra--” no wait, “after a mysterious eleven hour disappearance in the country. Investigations uncover a complex to deliver a “messiah” to save the Earth from mankind’s corruption.” This is The Abyss. Uh, “MJ-12, a secret government agency studying UFOs, wants to kidnap Mary and control the child for their own purposes.” Well, duh. “But Dr.Stone (Erik Estrada) wants the child dead! At any cost!”
J: So Erik Estrada is the protagonist but he wants to kill a child?
JH: Yeah!
J: Ok. I’m on board for that
JH: Alright. “When Mary turns up brutally murdered…” spoilers! “Her sister Lisa vows revenge, only to find herself the new target for the alien conception”
J: Sounds horribly complicated
JH: I wou--I think we’re gonna get a lot of aliens raping chicks…
J: Oh
JH: In this movie. And Erik Estrada’s teeth
J: [Chuckles once, turns to the camera] Alien Seed
JK: Let’s go! What are you still doing out here?! [Jay shuffles away]
JH: (?) No wait!

[5:14] Rich: [As the woman driving] “Oh my god, someone pulled up next to me!”

[5:44] R: Wait, they stopped because they hit some empty cardboard boxes?

[5:59] [Outside]
J: I wonder what else is in store for our future
JH: I don’t know, let me dig around in there for a minute [Starts moving towards the dumpster]
J: Ok [Josh bumps into Jay] Ah! Fuck!
[Josh sticks his head and arms in the dumpster, a cat screeches]
J: Please hurry
JH: Oh! [Shows the tape] It’s YOR!!!
J: It’s mine?
JH: No, that’s--that would be “yours” [Hands over the tape]
J: [Grabs the tape] Oh. Uh, this is Yor: The Hunter from the Future [Josh raises his arms] Although, he looks like a barbarian from the past. “In a primitive land of huge, lumbering reptiles, fierce cave-dwellers, and ancient mystery, Yor, the mighty warrior, sets out on a quest to learn the truth of his own identity. This spectacular fantasy adventure takes place in a time warp where the past and the future mysteriously collide”
JH: Well, see, that explains everything
J: Yeah. Uh, “blending stone age brawn with dazzling technology….” “Dazzling!”
JH: Dazzling
J: “Yor, played by Reb Brown, has mastered his primitive planet, but somehow he knows he does not belong. The only clue to these fleeting memories of another time and place in his gol--”...what?
JH: What?
J: “The only clue to his fleeting memories of another time and place is his gold medallion, a burnished bronze symbol of Heaven’s fire”
JH: Is it bronze or gold?
J:..It’s bronze
JH: But it’s gold?
J:....................Oh yeah. “Roa, the priestess in the ‘forbidden land…..’” Uh, forbidden land 
JH: (?)
J: “Tells Yor that--” this is going on forever
JH: Oh my god
J: “Tells Yor that his answers lie in a fleeting island across the sea”
JH: Augh!
J: “A land where time and technology are paradoxically reversed”
JH: What!
J: Haven’t they already explained this to us?
JH: (?) It happens again!
J: It happens again?! “There, the secret of Yor’s ancestry--” fuck this, I’m cold! Let’s go in [Josh takes the tape and runs, Jay laughs]

[8:13] Jessi: What if he just said “Yor fucked!”

[8:22] J: “Oh no, what has he done to that stick?!”

[8:37] JK: “That’s what we do here in the future,  we sell(?) dildos”

[9:51] JH: “Cathy Shower is Robo-CHIC,” now, there were two Robo-CHICs…..in the movie
M: Right off the bat it’s wrong 
J: Right off the bat it’s wrong
JH: Right at the top
J: The first thing we--yeah, we were watching the movie and--who noticed it? At first? We were like, “is that the same woman?”
JH: Uhhh I think it was Jack
Man: Get down!
JK: No, look, that’s a different person!
J: Is it? No
JK: Look at her!
JS: Yep

[11:10] M: The only part that’s not a machine is the wig

[11:29] R: The perfect weapon is a small elf that stabs you in the crotch [Plays clip from Elves]

[11:59] [Several men are shuffling around while they stand in a close-knit circle formation]
JK: It looks like they’re gangbanging someone

[12:24] R: If you’re gonna tack on the “C,” can’t you also tack on a “K”?
J: Yeah
[Silence]
JH: No
J: That sums up this whole movie, actually, like…
JH: “Couldn’t you have?”
M: “Couldn’t you have taken another step to make it a little better?”

[13:36] R: You know, she--she might not be as strong as an atom bomb, but she did hold her hand under that table while the forklift lifted it up

[14:37] J: And...is--this is the first movie that we gave up on, I think? Everybody just kinda left the room at some point….[Jay and Josh leave the screening room, Mike is already gone, Jack and Rich stay behind] Some of us left the room and gave up, others developed stockholm syndrome, where we just started laughing because there was nothing else to do
R: There was like--there was like, three good scenes in a row and we thought things were turning around

[15:59] R: But this movie actually made us miserable
J: Yeah
R: It wasn’t--it wasn’t boring, it should be pointed out, it wasn’t boring, it was misery

[18:10] J: Ohh yeah, Burt Ward is in this movie
JH: Aughhh
J: Because Burt Ward...needed to pay his rent that month?
M: Jay, Jay, our audience was born in 1999, who--who’s Burt Ward?
J: Burt Ward was the original Robin
R: In the 1960s Batman
J: In the 1960s Batman
JH: The original television actor Robin
J: People know who Burt Ward is
M: They--no, no one knows who Bort Ward is by name
J: No one knows who Bort Ward is ‘cause Bort Ward isn’t a person
JH: Guys...what if Batman saved Robin before they got in the car?
J: What?
JH: Get in the car?
J: [Exhales then laughs]
[Camera zooms in on Rich looking oblivious]
M: Where do you come up with these jokes?
JH: Ahhhh I’ve got my writers….

[18:58] R: This movie is so bad it made me feel sorry for Burt Ward

[19:05] M: Well that’s an interesting element of this movie, was, it’s like a--like, just--a bunch of shit smashed together. There’s numerous, uh, types of production values? 
J: Yeah
M: There’s like, the--there’s the handheld....like, we’re in the news station stuff--that--that is this movie, right?
J: Yeah
[Rich and Josh laugh abruptly]

[21:58] Scientist: Yeah? What did you done?
Robo-CHIC: I done good
JK: [Laughs heartily] Fuck this so hard!

[26:04] M: You know it’s bad when it’s a *low rent* Xtro

[27:14] [Mike tries to say something four times but Rich rants about Alien Seed and doesn’t allow Mike to say anything]

[28:14] R: The slow-speed chases, you’re saying that’s care?

[29:33] M: Give *this* guy all the dialogue

[29:44] R: How about that acting?
JH: How about *everyone’s* acting, in that whole fucking movie
J: Him--him especially, though
R: Let’s give *him* the imaginary Academy award for that
J: My favorite part involving that character was when they were interrogating him and they punched him so hard that his shirt ripped apart [Josh and Rich laugh]
R: You call it Alien Seed and you don’t have any aliens in the movie--[Overlapping dialogue]--because you want to sell this to somebody who likes science fiction so you--
J: Yeah
R: Alien Seed on the box, you have a picture of an alien, and then they watch this movie, it’s just some guy driving around a fucking parking lot [Mike and Jay laugh]
M: Was this the movie with the--the, like, the drugged-out women and the guy in the--was that Robo--
J: That was Robo-CHIC, Mike
[Pause]
[Rich laughs]
M: My--my brain no longer retains the memory of these movies
JH: You know what? That’s--
M: It’s just a blur
JH: That’s your body fighting it
M: Yeah. It’s like my immune system is fighting off these movies? “Don’t form any new memories! You’ve have--you’ve had enough!”
J: “Do you really wanna think about Robo-CHIC for the rest of your life?”
JH: No, god, no!
M: It’s like I’ve never seen ‘em
R: The little brain goblins are just ripping apart the connections. “Hurry! We have to stop this!”
[Everyone laughs]
J: “Why does he keep doing this to himself?”

[31:17] [Arrows point to two different spellings of a name. Written on screen is: Fun Tip: Always remember to check your spelleng]

[33:04] R: Yor is about a bunch of people who run around in loincloths...and some of them are painted purple……...And then they fight Skeletor [Josh furrows his eyebrows] Here, back to you, Mike [Everyone laughs]
M: The--the Emperor-Vader
J: Em--Emperor-Vader
[Talking over each other]
R: Emperor-Vader Skeletor?
J: And his Spaceballs minions 
[Laughter]
R: Skele--Skele--Skelevader?

[34:07] R: It’s--it’s--it’s ok, it’s a fine movie, it’s not terrible, but it’s--it’s no piecemaster

[35:34] J: Everybody wants to fuck Yor in this movie
R: Yes!
[Mike and Jay stare at Rich, nobody speaks for 7 seconds]
JH: That’s--well, yeah
J: That’s the point of the movie

[36:40] M: Is--was that the shot where he’s walking around him in a circle?
R: That was--
J: That was Alien Seed, Mike
M: [Looks at the tapes]......Whatever [They all burst into laughter] They’re all the same to me now

[37:32] JK: [In the background] They--the whole thing was the rebel spaceship
JH: Ok
M: Oh yeah, the--the resistance movement against Emperor Devader (?)
JK: They shot down the spaceship, Yor...then Yor
M: Ohhh I--you lost me

[39:42] M: Planet of the Apes meets Star Trek meets Star Wars meets He-Man...meets...
JH: Definitely He--
M: The dumpster

[43:56] [They put Alien Seed in a dish filled with water, leave it outside overnight, and drop a sledgehammer on the frozen tape, smashing it into a million pieces]
