[Jack is dusting off a statue on top of a shelf, Josh walks in and bumps into him]
Jack: [Drops the duster] Oh-ohh! No! [Crashing noise]
Josh: Oh, why did--Hey! Hi, Jack!
Jack: Hey, Josh, now that you’re here [Picks up some tapes] let’s watch some moovies!
Josh: Oh, I like movies! What’s the deal with these movies?
Jack: Today, on Best of the Worst, we have three direct-to-video horror movies
Josh: That sounds...like it’ll be the best time
Jack: Not even good enough for the theaters
Josh: No! Well, most things aren’t
Jack: Josh. “I scream...you scream, we all scream...for The Ice Cream Man!”
Josh: That’s seriously the titling?
Jack: That is, yeah
Josh: [Looks at the case] Oh. I--
Jack: That’s nice. Ok. [Reads the back] “The happy jingle of the neighborhood ice cream truck turns into hell’s bells--[Josh laughs]--as Gregory--” yeah, it’s clever. [Continues reading] “Turns into hell’s bells as Gregory Tudor (Clint Howard) delivers torture, murder, and mayhem with every scoop of rocky road!”
Josh: This didn’t make it to the theaters?
Jack: For some reason
Josh: That’s insane!
Jack: “After witnessing the murder of his friend, the ‘Ice Cream King’”--[Josh claps]
Josh: [Quietly] Yes!
Jack: “...Gregory shows up to become a demented ice cream man with a mysterious frozen treat” [Josh giggles] Uh, “no one is safe from the ice cream man in this pulse-pounding nightmare that’s sure to leave you chilled to the b-o-o-one!”

[1:41] [In the screening room, Jack and Josh are the only ones watching]
Jack: So the whole movie is Clint Howard just being a dick?

[1:53] Jack: Oh my god, that’s the kid from Playing Dangerous!
Josh: Mmpffft are you serious?
Jack: The fucking kid--
Josh: That’s the fucking monkey kid?
[Josh swings his arms around, Jack laughs]
Jack: Th--the--now we know this movie’s gonna be quality!

[2:18] Jack: I was just saying, this movie needs 10 percent more creepy clowns!
Josh: [Groans] Jack, that’s way more than 10 percent. That was, oh god…
Jack: That was 100 percent more creepy clowns….
Josh: Augh
[Fades to black]
[Jack and Josh are sitting on one side of the discussion table]
Jack: So guys, we watched some terrible movies today
Josh: Yeah we did
Jack: And I think that the worst one was Ice Cream Man [Josh inhales] But--but that’s just me, I think it’s terrible, Jack--[Cuts to a shot showing the whole table, Jack and Josh are sitting on the other side]--what did you think of Ice Cream Man?
Jack 2: I really liked Ice Cream Man! I thought it was cute, and the low production quality was just to get across a bigger artistic message
Josh 1: [Shakes his head] You lo--really, you love this movie? I mean, this was a piece of shit movie, I mean, Clint Howard...he--he was given a chance to star, and he did his best, and like, the acting was pretty okay, but I mean, it’s just a piece of shit
Josh 2: There’s a reason Clint Howard only stars in one movie, this movie, and it sucks
Jack 1: [Chuckles] Yeah, you know what I *don’t* scream for? The Ice Cream Man [The two Jacks laugh]
