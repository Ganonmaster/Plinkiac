[Colin is inspecting the burned carcass of the Cleared for Takeoff tape and the toy airplane, Mike opens a door and walks in while whistling, wearing a Grown Ups 2 visor, he notices the camera and stops whistling]
Mike: Oh [Takes off the visor and throws it to the side] Jesus Christ. Oh! [Approaches Colin] Oh hey Colin, what are you doing back?
Colin: I never left
[Flashback to Best of the Worst episode 13]
Josh: “Jack slips without realizing it, and reveals he is the mastermind of the conspiracy.” Spoilers!
Jay: This is giving the whole movie away
JH: Box!
[Cuts to Colin standing by a shelving unit]
C: [Laughs] Yeah
[Best of the Worst episode 15] 
[Jay and Josh are outside by a dumpster]
J: So the first movie we have here--[Turns around and pulls a tape from the dumpster]--is….Robo-CHIC. Though technically….
C: [Blows air into his hands and rubs them together] I’m not looking forward to seeing Robo-CHIC
[Cuts to Best of the Worst episode 14, Rich is destroying the Christmas tree]
J: Rich, calm down!
M: Rich, Rich!
C: [Flatly] Oh noooo!
[Goes back to Colin and Mike]
M: Hmm. That’s weird, I don’t remember any of that. [Points] Hey, who’s that guy?
[Jim is standing off to the side, he lowers his mug, stares beyond the camera]
Jim: I’m Jim. I’m also a visual effects--artist from Canada
M: Jaayyy! The Canadian visual effects artists are multiplying again! [In a low voice] Goddammit….[Crosses his arms, looks at Jim and Colin both staring into the distance] What are you guys looking at? [Moves on to introducing the movies] Well, Colin, since you’re still in America, I can think of no better thing to do than to watch three American action movies
C: Sounds good! 
*Movie #1 Ghetto Blaster (1989)*
C: “If the cops won’t stop the gangs, he will” and, uh--
M: Who’s he?
C: Well, this guy that’s out of focus on the front cover of the--
M: Ohh
C: Of the VHS
M: Is he holding a muffler?
C: I don’t know what he’s holding
M: Um. And then yeah, random gang members are just cut out from stills of the film, t--truly a terrible cover--
C: Yeah
M: Um, hopefully the film is terrible as well
C: Yeah. Well, it *is* in the action genre, so I think that’s perfect, and 4.99 though, it’s pretty good
M: 4.99, yeah…
C: And, uh, [Flips the VHS over and reads the back] “street gangs have turned a peaceful community into a war zone. Automatic gunfire rips through the night. Innocent victims are mowed down in drive-by shootings and the cops say they’re powerless to stop the assault”
M: Well, so what’s the problem?
C: We--[Giggles, continues reading]--”This neighborhood has a new power. Uh, the gang’s rule is over--a Special Forces Vietnam Vet has just declared war”
M: Ok, so this is like, um...The Exterminator with uh--uh, a boombox
C: Yes
M: Ok
C: In the video, in--youtube video, the trailer, he does use a ghetto blaster as a weapon
M: No shit!
C: Yes

[3:00] Guy: You looking for something, old man?
Old man: What you’ve done to my cat? [Jay, Rich, and Colin laugh, Mike claps]

[3:19] JM: Hi, Rich Evans
Rich: Hello, Jim [They shake hands]
JM: How are you?
R: I’m doing okay
JM: There’s a movie here called Terror in Beverly Hills, starring Stallone [Camera zooms in, showing that “Frank” was printed in small lettering above “Stallone,” slide whistle sound effect plays]
*Movie #2 Terror in Beverly Hills (1989)*
R: That--that name sounds familiar. “Stallone…”
JM: You want to hear about the movie?
R: No. It sounds “terror-ible”
JM: I--I don’t get it. “Terror--[Rich chuckles]--in Beverly Hills when the president’s daughter is kidnapped, it’s up to an ex-marine to save her. The problem is that the terrorist leader has a lingering hatred for him, as he has been wrongfully blamed for the death of his wife and children. The action heats up though as the two mortal enemies confront each other with extreme violence”
[Rich sighs]

[4:53] J: Well, our final film tonight is the highly anticipated--[Cuts to a clip(?)]--Killing American Style
C: I wonder if that’s a prequel to Killing Canadian Style
J: How do you kill Canadian style?
C: (?) kindness
*Movie #3 Killing American Style (1990)*
J: Actually, the reason why we’re excited about this film is that it’s the long lost film, from the director of...Hollywood Cop…
C: [Chuckles] All right
J: Samurai Cop…
C: Ohhh
J: And now we have this, which I’m assuming was originally titled, uh, Killing American Style Cop
C: It’s--rounds out the Cop Trilogy
J: Yes, yes. This was recently released, uh, I don’t think anybody has seen it. I don’t even know if anybody saw it when it came out, but--[Reads the tagline] “There are all kinds of killings…” no punctuation, ok “there are all kinds of killings the best is American style.” Starring Jim Brown, and Robert Z’Dar
C: Sweet!
J: And the guy that is not the Samurai Cop guy
C: Uhh
J: It looks just like him
C: But they’re reusing his wig, I think
J: [Laughs] [Looks at the back, makes a confused expression] Eugh--Andrew Martin from Facebook says….“raping, robbing, kidnapping, killing. The action continues….” Okay
C: I love that guy’s reviews [Jay laughs] On Facebook
J: Andrew from Facebook?
C: Yeah
J: Yep. “A gang of hot-headed brutes, led by Tony Stone (Robert Z’Dar), a sexual sadist John Lynch...himself?” I don’t think you’d wanna kno--be known as the sexual sadist
C: What is he a sa--is he a sexual sadist in real life?
J: That’s what they’re implying, I think
C: Wow
J: “And sexual sadist John Lynch (Himself) [Colin laughs] execute a robbery with some inside help. A bloody shootout with the LAPD ensues and the criminals are apprehended. After a brief stint in the slammer, the gang escapes a prison bus with the help of Tony’s brother Jesse, who is critically wounded in the process. He needs a doctor, fast. A hospital v--” what? “A hospital visit too risky...they seek out other options.” [Rich laughs in the background] So this--
[Camera pans around to show Rich and Jim standing in the hallway watching them]
C: Is that the whole fucking plot?
J: There’s more!
C: Oh my god!
J: There’s so much more! Uh, “now on the run, they commandeer a palatial residence, taking hostages. All-American good guy John Morgan,” some guy from Rambo 3, “returns home...” returns home from where? “Becoming a pawn….” What the hell is happening in this movie?
C: How does it end?
J: [Laughs] “Sent out to retrieve the doctor,” uhhh, oh my god, I don’t want to read this any more
C: It’s gonna spoil the movie
J: “All too aware they will face [Pronouncing the words slowly] systematic execution…..when….his usefulness expires, Morgan’s killer instinct takes over. He now must outwit and outgun the would-be thieves, American style. Or his family may not live to see another day” I’m fucking exhausted
C: Oh my god almighty

[8:50] JM: This is like watching something made on another planet

[8:59] [At the table]
J: Well, uh, we watched three classic American action movies this week….Uh, how quickly do you guys want to get back to Canada now?
C: Yeah, I think if this is all you have to offer, uh--
J: Yeah
C: I’m gonna change my flight tonight, and, uh, head back
J: Ok
C: Thank you, thank you
R: Alright
J: End of discussion!
R: Alright everybody, I hope you enjoyed watching this episode. Uh, please like us on Facebook!

[11:24] [Making fun of the fact that the characters in the movie keep talking about how bad the neighborhood is]
M: “Have I told you about the neighborhood yet?”
J: “Years ago this neighborhood wasn’t as bad as it is now but now it’s bad”
M: “Do you want some watermelon?” [Zooms in on the woman’s shirt that looks like a watermelon]

[12:55] J: Richard Hatch is basically like the Wile E. Coyote?

[13:44] C: I love how it was so ineffectual, the guy had it like, on his shoulder right next to his head and it exploded, and like--
R: Just kind of fall over
C: Did nothing to him
JM: In the trailer, you get the--you get the sense that, ghetto blaster’s the big weapon that he’s created, and that, you know, he goes around attacking people with the ghetto blaster and that’s not true at all, and it only lasts like a minute, and that’s really--
C: And it’s in a montage
J: Hmm-mhm
JM: ‘Cause then all you’re left with, sorry--all you’re left with in the end is Richard Hatch

[15:49] J: So we got a clown on a motorbike being chased by thugs, and it’s the most boring fucking thing ever
C: Sounds like it could be made--anybody escapes by jumping over a teeter totter...over a fence
R: Let’s talk about the end of the movie because I don’t like anything in the movie and I want to be done talking about it [Jay laughs] How about--how about that explosion?
[Plays clip]
J: And I think, actually, on set they were probably surpri...surprised by how big it was, like that was just massive. And it’s like there was one big explosion here, and then there’s one really close…
R: “Oh my god, there’s a chain reaction starting!”
J: Yeah, and it was--it was massive, I mean it was like bordering on, um, what’s that, um, Arnold Schwarzenegger film called? Ugh I can’t remember
J: Junior?

[23:02] J: And then where do the--where do the terrorists get away to? Where’s their hideout?
C: The old bean factory
Cop: I think I’ve spotted the white limo out here, uh, by the old bean factory
Dispatcher: The terrorists have the president’s daughter in the old bean factory off the 101
J: The old bean factory
C: Yeah
J: Which is never given an address?
C: No!
J: It’s just the old bean factory and apparently all the cops know where this is
C: There’s only one of them
J: [Laughs] How do we know this? How do we know there’s only one old bean factory?
C: It’s the old--
R: How many *old* bean factories are there, Jay?
J: But is it the *oldest* bean factory?
R: There was--there was only one bean factory until the great bean factory boom of 1972. There’s--there’s like 5 or 6 new ones

[24:00] R: She--she looks like keyboard cat

[25:41] Jessi: They can’t show anything else because someone’s doing laundry on the other side of the basement 

[26:45] R: You know what the best part of that scene is, though? When the camera starts dollying away, right? You see on the President’s desk...there’s--there’s a ceramic seagull! [Jay laughs] They couldn’t find a bald eagle so there’s this ceramic seagull sitting on the desk of the President of the United States

[31:48] [A guy on rollerblades skates past in the background]
Rich and Mike (?): Wheeee!!

[32:24] JM: The suspense is boring me

[32:34] Guy: They don’t make ‘em like they used to
R: What?! The fuck does that mean?
J: Was that an attempt at an action one liner?
M: I think so
JS: “They don’t make people like they used to?”

[34:45] R: It’s a beauti--it’s a beautiful movie. A beautiful, wonderful, amazing movie and it will change your life
C: Yeah
R: It will change your life forever
J: It certainly changed Frank Stallone’s life
R: And you will never look at Frank Stallone the same way again, if you’ve ever even looked at him before, that is [Jay laughs] Which you probably haven’t because he’s Frank Stallone

[35:37] J: Uh, Rich Evans...explain what happens in Killing American Style
R: Colin?
[Colin plays a farting sound effect from a fart machine box(?)]
R: There you go
J: Wait, what was that? [Someone giggles in the background]
[Colin plays the sound again]
R: I’m not sure I caught all of that
[Colin plays it again, Jessi dies of laughter in the background]
Rich and Jay: Ohhhh ok
J: I get it
R: Ok
[Silence]
[Rich claps]

[40:54] J: Like what are you doing?
C: Oh, that is horrible…
J: Who directed this film? The guy who made Samurai Cop?

[42:26] J: And his uncle--and his uncle and his mother are both younger than him
Robert Z’Dar: Good. Mom, we’ve gotta move fast
His “mom”: What’s the address?
JH: “Mom?!”
J: “Mom?!”
R: “MOM?!”
[At the table]
R: Maybe he was pre-dopted (?)

[44:17] [Josh and Colin get up and leave, Jessi and Rich laugh, then Mike leaves, then Jim]
J: The first action scene and everybody leaves
JS: I know!

[44:39] JS: I like his little doctor bag (...) “I have like--I have like five bandaids. Is that gonna be ok?”

[45:52] JM: It’s a great angle

[46:25] R: And then instead of telling her to get out of the tub, he like kind of awkwardly climbs on top of the tub and then he’s--he kinda pulls her out, and then he humps her with his bellybutton 
[Plays scene]
J: Whelp. That happened
JM: Ok
J: Pfff
[Mike exhales]
[Pause]
R(?): That was thoroughly unpleasant

[47:39] R: They know about the hotel (?) for money
M: How?
R: I don’t know, I don’t care [Jay laughs] They just do. We have to deal with that fact

[48:04] JM: And then you look in the room, and on the wall, is--is a picture of a skeleton on a bicycle

[50:13] M: He didn’t get shot anywhere
JH: He got shot in the cheek 
M: His face just absorbs it

[51:05] J: [Sighs] I never thought I’d say this, but I miss the charms of Matt Hannon from Samurai Cop

[54:53] R: So, would you say this is Amir Chevron’s uh, Last Temptation of Christ? [Colin chuckles]
J: I don’t understand what that means. I know that movie, but that’s a good movie
R: Yeah, well it was controversial and...people hated it, because it made them sick, the content, saying bad things about--ah, whatever
J: Did it have a man with a perm mullet in it? Did Jesus just have a perm mullet in The Last Temptation of Christ?
R: Almost….
J: Rich, can you just think about the fact that you just compared Killing American Style to The Last Temptation of Christ? [Rich covers his mouth and laughs] Just think about that
R: I’m so ashamed
C: Oh my Lord
R: I’m so ashamed
[Colin presses the button on the sound effect box, fart sound effect plays]
