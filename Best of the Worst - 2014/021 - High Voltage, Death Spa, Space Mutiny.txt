[Rich is looking at the VHS tapes on a shelf, he sighs, Josh walks in]
Josh: Hey Rich! Let’s watch some movies!
Rich: [Unenthusiastic] All right. What do you wanna watch? MORE action movies?
[Camera swings around to show Jay filling a cup with beer in the kitchen]
Jay: How about more horror movies? [Continues filling his Half in the Bag cup, NOW ON SALE!!! appears]
[Camera swings around again to show Mike opening an action figure, he drops the packaging]
Mike: [Depressed] How about sci-fi movies? Can’t get enough of those [Puts the toy in his mouth]
[Jack walks in holding a can of Monster energy drink]
Jack: I know! We could watch all three! It could be like a competition! Like ba--
[Battle of the Genres appears]
JH: Our first movie is our action movie, and it is called High Voltage
R: Well that sounds “shocking” [Josh makes a sad expression]
*Movie #1 High Voltage*
R: What? What’s it say, Josh?
JH: It says “electrifying, super-charged action!”
R: Ok, so they--they--they go--they got the whole electricity thing going on
JH: Yeah, and I don’t really believe them at all, but let’s--
R: Is it an action hero with electric powers?
JH: My God, I hope so! Let’s see, “shock treatment for action freaks!”
R:...Ok
JH: So we’re really, we’re really hammering this theme home here. Alright, “mess with the Asian mafia and you’ve got big trouble! Mess with Johnny Clay (Antonio Sabato Jr) and you’re a dead man!”
R: Ok
JH: “From mind-blowing stunts to earth-shaking explosions, High Voltage delivers a relentless, super charged showdown of the bad guys vs. the badder guys!”
R: Oh! So there’s no good guys, they’re all bad?
JH: No! Everybody’s a dick in here
R: Is--is this like the Sony Electro movie? Is that, you know...is...is this the Sinister Six prequel?
JH: I don’t know what you’re talking about. And that’s it, that’s all the--
R: That’s all?
JH: There’s barely anything
R: Oh that’s terrific!
JH: So you really don’t have a lot of information on this movie at all
[In the screening room]
JK: How weird
J: Yeah. It’s Lady (?)
JH: Oh look! The, uh, it’s the place where you grab to immobilize a lady. He doesn’t know about that, right?
J: What?
JH: Yeah. When you--when you grab right here--[Places a hand on his bicep]--she can’t do anything [Jack laughs] Just keep moving right along
Jessi: [To Mike] Here, try it
M: [Pulls on Jessi’s arm] Oh no!

[2:31] J: Oh, he’s gonna do the jumping-with-two-guns thing again--[Everyone cheers]

[3:02] Man: You didn’t really think I could betray Johnny, now, did you?
J: Oh Jesus
Woman: Wh--why’d you hit him? (?)
JK: Duh--
Other man: Realism
R: [High-pitched] WHAAAAAT!!
JH: Ahh fuck you!
R: What?!
JS: What?
[A bride with a veil turns around, it’s a man in disguise]
[Everyone laughs and cheers, Jessi screams]
JK: Alright
JH: They lost me and then they won me right back
J: Yeah
[In the VHS room]
R: So, next up in our Battle of the Genres, we have horror
JH: Ooh!
R: And for horror, we have Death Spa! 
JH: Ooh
R: Which--which is a bad movie on Blu-ray--[Josh nods]--which I think is a good sign
*Movie #2 Death Spa*
R: Uh, so we have Death Spa, and there’s a picture of a man with an exposed chest on a, on a exercise machine, and a skull lady. And it says “you’ll sweat blood!”
JH: Awesome!
R: “The new fitness club in town has everything a health nut could ever want, a variety of workout machine...classes taught by friendly and frisky instructors, and a state of the art computer control system for maximum client comfort”
JH: Great!
R: “Unfortunately it’s also possessed by the evil spirit of the owner’s dead wife!”
JH: That’s less than great
R: “And before long, every dumbbell, leg press, and rowing machine becomes a deadly weapon, for her to enact bloody vengeance--[Josh laughs]--on the club’s members. So if you’re looking for a real workout from Hell, enter Death Spa, a new experience in terror!”

[4:37] J: This movie fell into a vat of Saved by the Bell
JH: It’s, um, sexy? What is Ken Foree wearing? [Jay laughs]
R: He’s wearing a rainbow

[5:55] JH: Our third entry, our final entry, our sci-fi entry….Space Mutiny
*Movie #3 Space Mutiny*
JH: Uhh “breathtaking special effects from the team that brought you STAR WARS” [Rich laughs] It’s--it’s caps so it’s gotta be louder
R: Is that--is that--is that actually the Battlestar Galactica? The--the--the 70s one?
JH: It might be
R: It is! 
JH: Is it?
R: That’s totally the Cylon ship
JH: [Laughs] Oh, we’re in for a good time
R: All right!
JH: Yeah
R: All right
JH: All right, “starring Reb Brown (Uncommon Valor), James Ryan (Rage to Kill), John Phillip Law (Barbarella), aaaand Cameron Mitchell.” My favorite year, our favorite actor
(...)
JH: “The enormous Southern Sun spacecraft faces destruction from within when the evil Kalgan (John Phillip Law, Barbarella) and his men take control through a violent and explosive mutiny. Kalgan’s plan: scrap the ship and sell the passengers into slavery”
R: Oh
JH: “Only one man, Reb Brown, has the strength and courage to lead the fight against Kalgan’s rebels. Armed with laser cannons and neutron grenades, he leads the commander’s daughter and a handful of soldiers into a blasting battle against Kalgan and his powerful forces”
R: Ok!
JH: It’s pretty, uh, pretty buck standard sci-fi kind of deal
R: Yeah
JH: You know, um--
R: Reb Brown’s alright, but Cameron fucking Mitchell
JH: Cameron Mitchell
R: Cameron “Close The Fucking Door” Mitchell
Cameron Mitchell: Will you close the fucking doors?!
JH: [Puts the tape down] Beautiful. Let’s do this
R: Alright, let’s find out who is the Best of the Genre

[7:58] R: [Whining] Mom… [Jay and Josh laugh]
M: You’re embarrassing us
R: “Mom, stop trying to act like a teenager”

[8:44] Guy: Take this you big bitch [Rich and Mike laugh]
J: “You big bitch?”

[10:57] M: From the quality company that brought us such films as Elves and uh, Robo-CHIC. A-Pix Entertainment (?)
J: Well they’re one for three now [Rich giggles]

[12:25] [Four people in a standoff stare at each other for over 15 seconds, everybody just sits and watches silently, crickets chirp]

[12:51] J: It’s a fake bank. It’s a fank

[14:06] R: If I made this movie I would’ve used that shot 20 times
[Scene of a man falling onto a wooden container replays 20 times, “Go ahead and count them. I dare you. Assholes” is written on screen]

[15:52] JH: Those scenes there were nicely done for what they were, the stunts were good, the--it was a little uncreative in terms of, you know, it was a very (???) ripoff, but--
[Mike sneezes, the Death Spa tape falls over]
J: Oh no!
M: That’s the Best of the Worst [Jay and Josh laugh, Rich claps]

[16:10] M: Yeah, great action scenes and--and 
Mike and Jay: Great sound
J: Yeah
M: Really great sound effects, ev--even though that was--that seemed to be an emerging theme
R: I don’t--I don’t know about--
M: FroooOOOOM the--the films that we were watching, was that, the...we--we recognized a lot of what sounded like Lucasfilms sound effects? Um, the really deep, uh, Indiana Jones gun sound, the same punch sound effects
[Plays scene of a guy getting punched]
[In screening room]
M: Isn’t that Indiana Jones punching sound effects?
J: Yeah
M: Antonio--
R: But--
M: Sabato Junior’s guns--
JH: [Imitates gun sound]
R: There’s--
M: Had amazing sounds
[Plays scene]
M: [Imitates gun sounds] And--and that really hit home the action for me
R: But when you--when you hear--
M: And really--[Jay laughs]--the--the sound, if I’m gonna...if we’re gonna talk about the sound, and the action too….
[Slowly zooms in on Rich] 
[17:30] [As Jay explains the plot, Mike uses a bottle opener to open a bottle of beer, he shows off the bottle opener, which says Half in the Bag on it]

[19:53] R: Can we call them the fake-kuzas? (?)
M: Fa-kuzas? [Jay and Josh laugh] That’s--yep--
J: The fake-kuzas versus the fank robbers at the end of the film, yeah

[21:10] J: But the only reason they knew--the fake-kuza knew where they were was because of double-cross guy, right?
M: Our next film is called Death Spa [Jay laughs]
JH: But they had to do that because they had to kill The Dragon
J: Oh! So they were doing that just to lead them there
JH: Yeah! Just to end it
J: Ok
R: But--but they knew The Dragon’s girl was on their side at that point, right?
JH: Yeah
R: Couldn’t she just--
M: Our next film is called Death Spa

[24:56] [A man is kissing a woman with bandages over her eyes]
M: [As the woman] “Is that you, Roger?”

[27:36] M: That looks like Bozo the Clown’s outfit

[32:01] R: Maybe if she were like a, like a computer scientist ghost, it would’ve made more sense
JH: No, no, it was her brother, her twin brother
J: Yeah
R: [As a trailer voiceover guy] “She spent years working on this computer system. And now it’s acting haywire and she’s dead!” That would have made sense
J: That would’ve made sense
JH: Yeah, that would’ve--yeah
M: You should write screenplays, Rich…’cause...just the mild amount of effort--
R: Any--
M: --you would put in would make more sense than these
R: Any of the movies we watched tonight a five-year old could’ve made a more cohesive script
M: Yes!
R: Any of these movies

[33:10] M: The logic of the movie’s plot…[Jay laughs] first of all, whoever had the idea of having a haunted spa is stupid
J: [Laughs] No way, that plot--that premise is great!
M: No!

[36:20] M: [To Josh] Well, what is the plot of Space Mutiny?
R: I don’t know
M: I wasn’t asking you!

[37:11] JH: Uh, also, there are, uh, some Stevie Nicks-looking ladies, I’m not--I’m still not real clear what they were doing. From top to bottom, I have no idea
J: They’re the Dance of Birth ladies
JH: Why were they there?
J: They were there to oxygenate their womb space
R: They were there for flavor. This is--this is an era--[Notices the others’ confused expressions and laughter]--no, no, I mean, this is an era where science fiction...had….[Josh leans back and laughs loudly]
J: You said that so blunt and weird, like, [Casually] “they’re there for flavor”
M: What do you mean by flavor--
R: Seasoning. They were trying to emulate...science fiction at that time...had a lot of spiritual elements, Star Wars introduced the Force, and--and then from there like the actual Battlestar Galactica, they’d had like a Christian theme running through it, and there was--there was mystical elements coming into 80s science fiction
J: Ok
R: And so they thought they needed something mystical
JH: [Shakes his head] They didn’t

[38:15] JH: Don’t--don’t get handsy, there, Cameron

[39:12] J: There are mor-- multiple people set on fire in this movie
JH: Yes!
J: And that is a positive

[46:45] M: I, I....I have to agree almost completely with Rich, uh, as an action movie, this is really good! The fights--the fight choreography in that I thought was really good. The sound effects--
J: I thought the execution of a lot of it was sort of awkward, because of the low budget. But--
M: Are youuuu….
J: But there’s good--there’s good stuff--
M: Are you talking? This isn’t a discussion part [Jay laughs] Yea. Why don’t you just...why don’t you just shut the fuck up
J: I understand that you think High Voltage is the greatest film ever made
M: I don’t think it’s the greatest film ever made, but! [Jay laughs, Josh covers his face] For an Apex(?) film, the company that brought us Elves…I was shocked….Ironically, High Voltage
JH: No
M: I was shocked at how good the action scenes were, and--and the (?) too, and the sound effects
