[Intro]

Jack: Hi, Rich!

[Rich is staring blankly at nothing, and doesn't respond to Jack]

Jack: Uh, so Rich, this week we played, we played "Mass Effect: Andromeda", which is a sci-fi RPG, all about exploring the universe, where you can make different choices, and your choices matter.

Rich: No, they don't.

[Jack props the game up on top of the couch, between himself and Rich]

Jack: So, Rich, what did you think of "Mass Effect: Andromeda"?

Rich: I didn't play "Mass Effect: Andromeda".

Jack: Why...why not?

[Rich smacks the game onto the floor. Jack picks it up]

Jack: Like, I, I really think that one of the parts that I liked about Mass Effect...

Rich: Fuck it.

Jack: So, so you know, I've, I've never played any of the Mass Effect games before, and so as a, as a new player, kind of coming into the franchise, I, I thought it was a, thought it was a really interesting premise. Uh, and I did like, uh, a lot of the sci-fi universe.

Rich: It's a corpse. It's dead. It's a dead universe.

Jack: Like, as far as the dialogue is concerned...

[Rich takes the game out of Jack's hand and throws it on the ground]

Rich: I didn't play the game.

Jack: Um...

[Rich picks the game up off the ground, and slowly proceeds to destroy it through various means for the remaining twenty minutes of the video]
