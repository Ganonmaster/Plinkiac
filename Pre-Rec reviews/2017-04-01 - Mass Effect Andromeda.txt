Jack: Hi, Rich! Uh, so Rich, this week we played, we played "Mass Effect: Andromeda", which is a sci-fi RPG, all about exploring the universe, where you can make different choices, and your choices matter.
Rich: No, they don't.
Jack: So, Rich, what did you think of "Mass Effect: Andromeda"?
Rich: I didn't play "Mass Effect: Andromeda".
Jack: Why...why not? Like, I, I really think that one of the parts that I liked about Mass Effect...
Rich: Fuck it.
Jack: So, so you know, I've, I've never played any of the Mass Effect games before, and so as a, as a new player, kind of coming into the franchise, I, I thought it was a, thought it was a really interesting premise. Uh, and I did like, uh, a lot of the sci-fi universe.
Rich: It's a corpse. It's dead. It's a dead universe.
Jack: Like, as far as the dialogue is concerned...
Rich: I didn't play the game.
Jack: Um...
