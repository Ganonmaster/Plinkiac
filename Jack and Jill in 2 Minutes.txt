[Doorbell rings, Mr Plinkett opens the door]

Harriet: Hi! 

Mr. Plinkett: Why, it's my sister, Harriet Plinkett.

Harriet: Hi, Harry. I'm in town for Thanksgiving. 

Mr. Plinkett: Oh, god.

[Cut to a shot of Jay, prominently displaying the "VAIO" logo on his Sony laptop]

[Cut to Harry and Harriet]

Harriet: I brought all of my dogs so they could play with your cat. I'm going to be staying for eight months.

[Cut to Jay looking over his shoulder back at the Plinkett twins]

Harriet: I still can't wait to do all the fun things that are to do in New Jersey. I can't wait to see the cockroach Museum, but I can't wait to see the junkyard, and the rats. 

[Cut to a shot of two bottles of Coca-Cola, labels successfully facing forward, sitting between Mike and Jay]

Harriet: How are you doing, Harry? 

Mr. Plinkett: Yeah.

Harriet: You're a little bit balder than you were last time I saw you. 

[Cut to a close-up of Mike's hands, as he pops open the cap on his bottle of Coca-Cola]

Harriet: Oh, and you're so fat!

Mr. Plinkett: Oh, god. Make it stop.

[Cut to Mike and Jay enjoying the refreshing taste of Coca-Cola in a bottle]

Mike: They're so crazy.

[Cut back to Harry and Harriet]

Mr. Plinkett: You're so fucking annoying.

Harriet: ...your here, while I'm here. I said that wrong. Oh, well. Hee-hee-hee!

[Cut to Mike standing in front of a shelf that's displaying a bottle of Pepto-Bismol]

Mike: Listening to these two gives me heartburn. [Pauses to drink Pepto-Bismol] Ah, relief!

[Cut to Harry and Harriet]

Harriet: Our incontinent mother says hello.

[Cut to Jay, proudly displaying a large package of Oreos]

Harriet: Or, at least that's what my medium tells me.

Mr. Plinkett: Yeah, huh.

Harriet: He charges me $800 a minute to talk to our sweet mother. Isn't that crazy?

Jay [eating Oreo]: M'mm! 

Harriet: Oh, I see you've got some people over fixing your VCR.

[Cut to Mike and Jay at their work table, enjoying Dunkin Donuts coffee and assorted pastries]

Harriet: You getting a good deal on that? People fixing my rotary phone are taking forever. 

[Cut to Mike, slowly mouthing over a powdered donut]

They drink all the time, and they don't do anything. That's like a weird parallel between us. We have lots in common. Isn't that crazy?

Mr. Plinkett: Ugh, stupid bitch. You always gotta come to my fucking house when you're on vacation. Can't you go to Florida or somewhere nice. It's fucking New Jersey. Who the fuck does that? Whatever. Cunt.

[Harriet farts, Sandleresquely]
