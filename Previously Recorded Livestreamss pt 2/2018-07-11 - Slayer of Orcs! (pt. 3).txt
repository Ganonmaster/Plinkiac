Otto a balista I'm just I'm fond of this
level no brick but uh but in his own
series now is kind of weak kind of weak
full Punisher hardly what about that
scene right at the end of the Punisher
series itself yeah that was I mean hey
there was some decent action in the
Punisher show but not enough for a
Punisher show you know I'm saying I hear
you jack
you know here yeah you get it it was
alright but it wasn't it wasn't what it
could be I don't think it was as intense
as the best of the prison sequence that
that prison sequence will make a good
team it was beautiful
I'll take what I can get but yeah I'm
not I'm not taking Luke Cage and you
know I what I'm hoping for out of Luke
Cage still is that very least I hope
like they're they're working on some
decent misty maggot stuff and that's
what I really liked about season 1 of
Luke Cage is you know kind of misty
night being a detective and and doing
her thing and spoiler alert if you
haven't seen the defenders and most
people haven't so I'm gonna be okay
spoiling this misty night gives her all
he could play a ninja and so now she's
you know kind of back to work with her
arm cut off and you know trying to find
her place as a cop you know being a
being a handicapped person and so
there's some piece of misty night
what's happening with Lou and Rosario
Gaza yeah what's happening with Luke and
Rosario Dawson is so forced and Luke's
character is waffling back and forth and
it's not what I wanted to be oh I
thought I was waiting for more like I it
felt like you were taking a branzino but
why is it always waffles good I and I
love one big fan she's not waffling
oh here's a good one have I seen the
Americans I have not I've heard it's a
good joke that's the the KGB like 80s
spy TV show oh yeah it's supposed to be
good supposed to be very very good I've
heard nothing but good things like hide
it height of the Cold War there are some
happy hunt embedded Russian spies and
you know like dealing with dealing with
being spies but also trying to like have
a life a normal life suppose to be good
normal non spine life a lot normal non
spy life that's really just a cover for
their spy life and the balancing act
between that Keri Russell
can I say hi to Anita for you so she
will believe you hi
I guess hello hello
step right this way mr. Roarke spaced
out was Jack talking about Kim Possible
no I was talk about the America possible
had a show about KGB spies animated show
but a cheerleader James Bond agent oh
I'm sure they're very similar
I'm sure the Americans are just a
live-action adaptation impossible she
can do anything I get it they're do a
thing yeah yes sure sounds like they
were doing a thing
this doesn't seem fair
yes dad I why I've seen aunt wrote an
awesome rich is not if you like if you
like the first day man Vanilla's its
following
everybody likes Paul right
I I wouldn't have blown away I wouldn't
have blown away by ant-man and wasps but
also I wonder disappointed
so what does that mean what you expected
and that's fine yeah no more no less
first verse cheese fuck balls
Jesus almost got away from me you know
it's like I said it's fine it's you know
rubber fist fight it is ain't the
greatest most perfectly serviceable good
jokes I thought they did a better job
handling some of the jokes this time add
some good bits some good bits some good
jokes bits and petals no no spoilers I
know it's it's fresh out
God like the old way are I haven't seen
The Hobbit Holly Halloween reboot
trailer the Halloween reboot they're
removed so what is the third reboot yeah
what's-his-face Rob Zombie already did
his oh that's pretty
I didn't I didn't see I don't care I
don't care about thing why don't you
care about thing other guy cuz I don't
care if I think people like thing why
don't you care about thing Oh
people like thing oh shit now I have to
care about things make a thing about
dare you not care about things I'll make
it the greatest thing that everything
here Chuck I can't you can't make me and
I won't I can't and I won't and you
can't make me
I'm thinking jack you ever reach image
comics I've read it but you've never
reached for them I've never liked it
like at a time of great need and I reach
for Image Comics yet so they did not
reach back I've read some image comes I
think I've read most of powers which you
know is a decent series well like like
all Bendis series starts off really
interesting and then just evolves into
chaos and and despair
powers start off really interesting one
of my characters were miserable all the
time
that's it's just like you know like it
starts off like what if you're miserable
some of the time
oh people like that okay well that won't
like them miserable sometimes and
winning other times oh well people seem
to like them okay well how about I make
them miserable more how about more how
about it ever the entire story devolves
into utter chaos
yeah yeah so yeah powers started up me
but I mean I mean there was a lot of
there was a lot of good powers books
before it got to
numerous Valiant Comics in development
Russo brothers attached to either one of
them Rousso could probably do a decent
Archer and Armstrong so much ass-kicking
Russo's know how to do action alright
and handle comedy in their action so I
bet they could do a decent Archer and
Armstrong I'd like to see that
Gately says shut up and take my money
what did I say you had one job oh well
you aren't
what
Rousseau's are attached to quantum and
woody oh and you know I've never
actually read I've never read quantum
and woody so alright yeah what is it
it's a premise slightly goofy superhero
okay but not totally wacky yeah that's
where so brothers then slightly goofy
not totally wacky didn't Bruce her
brothers oh okay
lots of jumping lots of nonlinear
storytelling when they jump around in
time Oh woody is all silly is he's a
goofball no and that his partner quantum
is mr. serious we have to take being
hero seriously whereas I'm a goof around
yeah they might do a good job with that
remember they got to start with Arrested
Development really yeah yeah so they can
they can they can handle some
just straight up
David you know people I've talked about
region so many times on this very stream
that you're sick of talking about I just
don't know I don't know if this is a
joke or if you have stepped away the
several times I've talked about leaves
in season two it's not as good as season
one but I still enjoyed it it got it got
decently weird and I liked the ending
I'm excited for what they're gonna do in
season three that's it our Arrested
Development was great and that's why in
Captain America Civil War when they're
fighting in the airport there is the
blue terror trucks in the background and
that's why in infinity war you can see
hidden as an easter egg in there is
David Cross as the Blue Man Group guy
I'd not no thing ah I not know saying
you're not know thing yeah so that's
where we're so brothers got their start
huh people are also saying they might
have done episodes of community as well
but I didn't want to
I have positive feelings about the first
three seasons of Arrested Development
where is it - before before they went to
Netflix he blued himself that's right
the Tobias in the denim shorts blued
himself is in infinity war
the treat for you can you ever have too
many traps okay so it was it was the
first three seasons before they went to
Netflix and yes they were perfect the
first three seasons of Arrested
Development were just perfect elephant
you made - II don't like the Russos
action directing and after Winter
Soldier it that they do it's a fine job
you know what's happening and unlike a
lot of action see that's tough to say
because a lot of you can't say the same
about other people who direct action you
know what's happening they have a good
sense of space and I think they have a
good sense of pacing to the right
why is my batteries running that thing
sucks
I didn't know I was in charge of the
plug it aligns it anything I don't know
why did you why did you unplug it
why did you unplug a check why would you
assume that I unplugged it
oh boy oh boy be
present for you one for you and one for
you Richard you look away heading get
into it
should we you're talking about the
Netflix one and not the actual old the
Netflix glow yes I watch like part of a
we're care and then we just kind of
stopped okay you know what I did the
same thing with Lisa yeah
because because it's it's made by the
same people who did orange is the new
black and he said really liked orange is
the new black yeah they got a new show
we can watch that together it's got a
Alison Brie I think isn't it who I've
enjoyed in other things and then hey
let's watch this watches and we watch
like half of the first episode like yeah
didn't watch much more of it
Jack doesn't like community what else is
he wrong about so many things I'm wrong
about so many things
I saw the first couple of episodes of
community and didn't want to get into it
I've heard that a lot but like a lot of
shows if you go and just keep watching
you keep watching it gets good
blah blah blah it's like a blog no
longer part of our line of our blog know
you're blind this is my blog about
things that I'm not into community
Babylon 5 knows the Farscape The Venture
Brothers Jack weren't you into
everything I watched people are in doing
just that I do these things I'm sorry
black apply the parking wine Rick and
Morty and my board it'll hurt a lot

why-why-why hi everybody
rich said some questionable things while
you're away
whoa rich stop being so controversial
not calling me a jackass
stop pigs I did not call you an
incompetent jackass
I mean that's good that's good that
would be really mean I would that's why
I would not do that
right hi he did not say those things
well good I'm glad
hey Joe kitties says Jack maybe you
could try try to just watch the best or
highlight rated episode of the show and
see if it grabs you that way
I generally like to watch the show from
the beginning but no no oh no rich I
gotta restart the stage a thing no oh
fuck how do you I got like a roll or a
double jumper oh no I'm so sorry rich
that's yes this is not a saves come this
is a legit restart no that has never
happened before hey congratulations you
just found a new book yeah
found a new bug pissed about that did it
Johnny Rock bone I did watch HBO's Barry
that's a fine show Bill Hader as a
hitman yeah
Bill Hader as a professional hit man
who's contracted to kill Simon Tori in
California so he tracks him down and
finds him in an acting class and and
finds out that he actually wants to be
an actor oh it's cute it's really it's
it's a legitimately good show Henry
Winkler's in it yeah
who's grimy just great kills at every
episode yeah it's good job
all right let's do all of that we'd done
again ah pissed about that I'm very
sorry
twenty-one on the nine what kind of beer
do you recommend I'm drinking some
Leinenkugel's right now this is fine as
I've always said I'm a big I PA person
and so like for me the the happier the
drier the pioneer the more alcohol a
beer has the better everybody's taste so
different though we were talking earlier
about sours you can find really good
sour beer that's those are fun those
really nice and hard to have especially
in these hot summer days on these hot
summer days you find yourself a nice
arrival err which is like a deer and
fruit juice mixture
those are great
the rod ler that's the Rattler
and he's extreme catch me if you can
Batman but warning I'm going on this
sick halfpipe you gotta catch me Batman
you could have surfed waves actually the
Rattler would be a perfect 60s Batman
game at a pool
I don't know old chum he just seems to
hit into with surfing's fire with proper
safety but I always make sure a
lifeguard is on duty
dear rich any reason for all the
shakiness in your camera in the last
best of the worst
not particularly they were shaking this
in both cameras I thought you should
like that we're doing handheld well you
know you got on the monopod yeah usually
you're you're kind of like moving it
around a little bit yeah unless you were
going for I didn't know if you were
going for a thing because I haven't
watched the episode so maybe you were
going for like a Jack I've got
Parkinson's Oh Parkinson's terrible and
you should feel terrible
here dear jack do you watch did you
watch any of the post-credits scenes
adventure brothers usually that's where
the episodes comedy
I watched both episodes all the way to
the end I actually don't remember any
patient credit are they always doing
things I don't remember them
specifically but I watched both have a
lot of times it's actually pretty
important good times
excellent
kill them all she's encouraging made to
kill all of the monsters I know by
killing them you're doing a good job
yeah
yes about boat night I'm currently
working on beer number two for the night
so I guess I'm okay to drive thank you
for your concern is that why Jack
doesn't like Farscape you watching the
wrong order I watched the first few
episodes it just didn't do it for me I'm
so sorry I'm glad that you all like
parsley don't happen I - I feel well you
know obviously I've wronged everyone in
the very
sorry to bother you is not out yet here
I think it comes out this weekend and
I'm very excited to see its comedy about
a telemarketer and it looks like it's
gonna have a really interesting visual
style like every time he makes a phone
call it kind of drops him into that
person's house and they talk it like it
looks very very interesting
starring one of the guys who's on
Atlanta who's pretty funny on Atlanta
and looks like it could be like an indie
comedy hit like the indie comedy to
watch this season looks good
sorry to bother you
yeah it looks good it's really neat but
I think that comes out this weekend here
I don't know if it's out in other places
but
big time right there that's positive
oh yeah well Netflix like had the wrong
order on like two episodes it wasn't
like a whole big thing for for Farscape
Netflix had the wrong water it was like
they missed they mixed up like two
episodes it wasn't it wasn't like a
super important just weird yeah
all right I think we're back with more
you are blameless Atlanta is interesting
I've seen a couple episodes of Atlanta
and it's all right like it's good it's
very slow and I feel like I feel like
it's it's it's trying for comedy pacing
but it's very it's very slow and
deliberate and I feel like at least in
the fur I have much like the first four
episodes and I feel like it hasn't been
white found its footing it but it's very
close but it's it's very like it's
almost Curb Your Enthusiasm yeah that's
what it feels like that's what that's
what Atlanta feels like and but you know
Curb Your Enthusiasm is just like a
straight-up comedy and so you're like
it's pace like the comedy right yeah but
Atlanta is a little slower and it's a
little more really it's a little calmer
make sure nobody's dying is anyone on
fire
someone might be on fire it's the old
can't ignore the one nope absolutely not
absolutely not all right back to this
ship here we go
Oh God crazy I've already forgotten the
beer that I'm drinking I just grabbed a
random one out of the fridge it's a
knife I think it's a Colorado IPA let's
see here Polly Polly says genuine
question no judgment
I noticed Colin and Jim seemed to be
perfectly in sync with the format of
best of the worst Plains even more so
than before once meaning they spoke at
the scene it isn't me or this rlm have a
very specific sense of humor now also
England is out of the world I don't I
think there's always yeah it was like a
stylistic choice I think I think
nothing's changed and Jim and Colin have
been on the show but I don't know I
don't know what this question is behind
they're just more comfortable that could
be that could be
I'll take what I can get
I don't yeah playing probably I haven't
seen the episode so I don't quite know
what you're talking about but I don't
think any style has changed or yeah
comedy or humor or anything you know Jim
and Colin get it they know it's over
then we find similar things funny but
that's kind of why we're friends
more than like red letter media is this
type of humor and here's the memo on the
jokes you're going oh yeah I mean for
any guest I mean people know we give
them a beat sheet of jokes they can and
can't tell right right right
it's it's more of like a style chart of
our comedy likings our comedy
preferences and Jim and count finally
got it this time it took a lot of
coaching years of coaching
that's right number two
Dom DeLuise number 3 explaining Dom
DeLuise is too
for Dembe reason number four back to
families is it too dumb or too young too
young
okay I mean either worse books oh yeah
we have it
RORO dango we have a ton of off-limit
jokes absolutely
planking no jokes about them there was
an accident early on in our LMS history
we don't like to talk about it you know
no we have done famous parents me in the
background just standing there
come on you've done that more than once
that's not planking you're just standing
still and like leaned up against the
wall that's not what you call it
blanking is when you is when you lay
down on something it's when you act like
you're stiff as a board
no no you have to be laying down flat on
something that's not meant to be later
for leaned against I don't think that's
a plant blanket Ria's is a horizontal
Chad
I'm getting a lot of jackets right here
really yep clanking you gotta be
horizontal then you just need to be like
a boy you know what that's twice in one
scream that I'm like
this is a lot of people I flat out do
not believe called batman' cattleman
called I knew what planking is this is
this is the only thing I'm holding we we
both have festered we both foot no I'm
absolutely
Oh we'll see no now they're trying to
make sure I pull myself back and they're
asking me to talk more about the venture
I think I'm gonna be sick
I've got this on lockdown jack
got nothing from Joe real absolutely
impossible for anything to go wrong
flanking discussions please wasn't the
other popular Gundam people did flanking
time
dabbing can we talk about the Harlem
shake
everyone did remember when everyone was
making their own Harlem shake videos
good good rich they're asking you to
gamble no okay how do you dab I know how
but I also have children so and and let
me tell you this the kids they will dab
at anything they will dab at the drop of
a hat
they're super into dabbing range
okay as long as I execute this level
should be pretty easy and hopefully
fairly quick okay then after this the
grand finale oh shit well shit again I
get it Jack hates Luke Cage season 2
because he dabs I do not dab my children
damn it's very popular at the school the
dabbing I don't think you're speaking
English you know you know what else is
really popular at the school of flossing
which is awesome is that the new hip
thing we're doing which is a dance world
the flop
okay that means more sense all the kids
have lost the teeth only nerds don't
frost you a nerd what's that what's that
gum disease get out of here loser dork
no gingy's or gingivitis no gingers

I'm sorry Jack turquois I cannot teach
you how to dougie because I don't know
how to do
whoa that should have gone worse than it
oh that's a terrible way to start see
here pally says sorry about the previous
question didn't mean to be condescending
nope Ellie I was we were more confused
yeah yeah we didn't we didn't think you
were being kind of sending we just
didn't understand what you were saying
all the best got married three months
ago wife and I are planning on having
kids in the next year and moving to a
new house this weekend how do I convince
her that getting a switch is a good idea
you might just have to say it's
something I'll enjoy it's something that
I'll enjoy and you know it's important
it circuit down there what's really
important before you have kids is to get
a little you time because once you have
kids you won't
alright alright we're doing good yeah
decisive I like the Titan census did you
guys hear that lungcap ocinski is making
his next film with Leo Fong I heard yes
challenge of the five gauntlets his lens
new film challenge of the Superfriends
challenge it was a challenge of the DC
superheroes they changed the name at
some point of the Superfriends it was
challenge of something oh yeah very well
The Adventures of the Superfriends The
Adventures of the super-powered
fraternal Brotherhood it doesn't roll
off the tongue no wow this was later in
the show's run when it was like the 80s
and the show the Superfriends weren't
cool anymore super Superfriends is a
super lame name yeah yeah Jack it was
challenge of the Superfriends okay
do my kids get to watch prereq they
catch me editing sometimes and they want
to watch and they always get really
upset when I stopped the episode cuz I
haven't edited that part yet it's just
like a video of unedited video of me
irate with a wide shot have to explain
that that doesn't exist like I need to
make it first so we can't watch that cuz
it and they're like no we just want to
hear you talk
like they just yeah I mean it's just
screens they love watching shows and so
but like let me let me make the show and
then I let you then you can watch it so
yeah I mean they've seen prereq I don't
let them watch prereq lot there's lots
of custom who knows what we're gonna
talk about yeah but yeah they watch the
show every once in a while they think
some bits of funny I've run some bits by
them you run it by your choice yeah run
by the children this is good this is
good enough for a ten-year-old all right
good enough for me
that's always been important to me with
my kids take
Hausa they know how the the movies are
made and so they never get super freaked
out by a movie because it's all fake
here oh yeah look at here's how this is
me that used to be a lot more fun now
just use computers well you know you're
right but I can do some of that computer
stuff scishow than that too like hey you
guys want to then they use their
computers yeah I remember when when
making of this uh bad move it used to be
really interesting to watch that's done
those are days long gone by for the most
part yeah
to see that part in the credits where
800 names stroll by in two seconds
that's who made all the fun stuff how
about some gross overkill
was the fun kind of fun
yeah like you play video games they play
all sorts of you know they play some
garbage video games
but a lot of iPad games minecraft they
like the we have a Lego Batman game with
enjoy they were really in the Mario Kart
for a while
all sorts of games they get they go
through I mean like I'm sure like every
kid they go through like stages of
obsessions with games where it's like
this is the only game they care about no
other games matter like right now
they're obsessed with 500 credits and
they've never played five nights at
freddys just the culture they know what
they know it I think they were at a
friend's house and the friend was
watching like let's play youtube videos
we have nights at freddys and they saw
that and they know somehow they know
everything about five nights at freddy's
but they have never played I don't get
it they want any of it and asking I
can't play AI I have them if you want to
play it like this really kids games I
remember like I remember you and I
playing them and I gathered that meant
for children that's about it
my dreams of dragging in class
as storm Templar all kids have ship
dates my mind I think that the whole
kids
there might have been an argument for
kids not having a suitcase back in the
day just because we didn't have a show
like all we had was Mario now is too
many options
jack is very visibility fan-based five
minutes rated oh I kind of all the
parental controls on all the idea yes
I'm a parent who is comfortable with
technology microchips Porsche that
little guys working for me now
oh great he sucks that I don't work no I
don't let them work through things they
suck you want hey Morgan yes I do
the nice thing about being a parent who
is technologically savvy is I know how
to do all this
you hear that 18t wants to fuck with HBO
by forcing them to up there oh I don't
care yeah better things worry about I
don't care what are you worried about
well oh no they might make another show
I like I don't I don't understand what
the concern is here
City shows on HBO yeah
Netflix is trying to Disney they're
gonna own everything somebody no that's
very true Jeff
that's not afraid of conglomeration
because he is a media app it's
conglomeration giant corporation I'm
definitely afraid of confinement no
relation I'm I'm I think we should all
be very afraid at Disney buying
everything Disney having absolute
control over all the intellectual
property that's something we should
definitely be concerned about
I'm not incredibly worried about it
because there will always be people
making things and our avenues for
watching the things that people make are
now larger than ever what do I need that
this is a question just for you I know
it is I know it is
today that
but
so yeah we should be concerned about all
like one business owning all of the
intellectual property but I don't think
that will ever happen because there will
always be people making weird shit that
Disney won't buy and our opportunity to
get that shit is greater and greater so
I think though there's going to be
absent flows
there we go
until YouTube de monetizes them right
well then they'll go to Vimeo Vimeo or
they'll go to another service or they'll
publish their own stuff everything will
be fine
I'm not incredibly worried about it to
see that hunchback jack is something I'm
more concerned about I'm less concerned
about uber media conglomerate than I am
about the loss of net neutrality that is
something that will affect everyone and
us as consumers that is something we
should be actually concerned about right
now
without the riffs there's no magic any
on either side the order mages fine
they must've I'm surrounded by eight
entrances four guys to run around I got
these in the corridors this one's a
bitch
nice this one's a real bitch yeah yeah
thanks I was getting bored here okay you
know that jack is against copyright that
means he's okay I know that's I know you
I know you're trying to tell a joke but
I don't get the joke it doesn't matter a
little present for you
step right this way mr. Roark
burn an arc for me I'm most worried
about Amazon buying everything you know
their competitor now their competitor
should have brought the fire ring but
we'll see what happens well we'll see
I like how you like you say that before
there's any enemies on-screen
that's how well you know the game pretty
sure I've messed up before I've even
started
good night beer corn
tired and said yes which is enzyme yes
and Amazon has done has done some good
things
biased which streamers like for example
if here at which primary subscribe to
never never not or what I'm saying is
it's a possible and actually you know
twitch twitch has forced some changes
over on the YouTube side of things for
YouTube creators that they've started to
implement something like monthly
subscriptions and the ability to tip on
YouTube because they saw the positive
influence on creating over here on
Twitch and that's the positive benefit
of the competition between switching
user so there has been some positivity
holy fuck what happened I came really
damn close to that was that was really
good
I'm sorry no everything's fine
oh great great decorations oh yeah and
the first wakens I I dunno how Amazon
food for employees something for you do
you know how Amazon is able to be so
successful by by treating their
employees absolutely the video but no
Amazon is Amazon is nothing but the new
Walmart exploiting their employees to
sell things which week so they get an
edge in the marketplace really good for
consumers less good for
yes
Yetta that has creeped in is a good
thing
freakin anis checks secretly admires
Amazon I think I chopped it Amazon a lot
because they have cheap crap
ah let's see here what say use is just
three watch the starship with troopers
am I wrong or is that a massively
underrated film I mean it's dumb but
it's hugely entertaining and has a
message basically a lesser Robo Cop yeah
it's fantastic
it's fantastic all the time starship
troopers everyone knows that
it's not even done though it's it's it
does a really good job of pretending
it's done in fact Starship Troopers
might do too good a job pretending it's
done because a lot of people missed the
fact that it's pretending to be dumb
interesting way to throw it am i
incorrect no I'm just saying that's
that's an interesting way to put it
it's uh no Starship Troopers is great
it's a fantastic satire possibly too
smart for its own people don't
understand this is satire that's the
problem
that's the problem
it says too good of a job being action
flock
a satire of one of propaganda of action
movies it's saying America is fascist
yes it's it's a it's a commentary on
colonialism in general not just American
colonialism it's a satire on white dudes
how about that
Boop yeah you sound good sucked it blip
that's why every older person in the
movie is horribly disfigured yes because
they sacrifice them sacrifice is good
but don't worry about those old people
here's young people fucking because
that's what happens in the army you do
good do good things only good things
don't worry about the bugs or why the
bugs are there or what the bugs are
doing the bugs aren't people they're
afraid of us and see ya there can only
you can only become citizens whose
service savour yes says savour says it's
a satire on nationalism yeah another
great way to put it yeah hyper
patriotism
tartufo rich yeah we're doing some
research into the steam huge we talked
about that steam yes
steam apparently should it ever go down
would operate in an offline mode hold on
do they say so you can forever play the
games you've purchased so they say so
they say the current man address the
current management the problem is the
current management of steam isn't always
going to be the current management of
steam
mmm
never lines I hear a lot of it's a
satire but rarely an example of how it
follows through with satirical elements
it the satirical elements are the
over-the-top violence and nationalism
and it's it's tough because it's also
like a fun to watch action movie is it
sarcasm that's too subtle
satire let's see mm sure or so
over-the-top and that it's gone back
around to not be subtle that could be
and I think like the things we were
talking about earlier the fact that you
know all the old people are horribly
disfigured
that's a satirical element you know the
fact that all the main characters are
young beautiful people who constantly
hook up and do amazing things is a
satirical element because that's like
part of the propaganda piece yeah join
the join the National Service look at
all these young beautiful people joining
the service making sacrifices
all right you did it you did it
we're I'm doing quite well great those
things
that's a fun travel
Titan says says showgirls and Basic
Instinct might also be other Paul
Verhoeven's that may be too well done as
bad movies and maybe genuine sapphires
on mainstream colleges
I could see that are going to be made
for basically nice things like basic
instincts is just too good to be seen as
a satire but I think anyone watching
showgirls knows that that's that's
clearly poking fun
my head hurt
and now bitch rich but have you ever
asked why you're killing more because
they want to kill humanity did you ever
question your orders or did you just say
yes sir I'll build the or traps yeah
it's kind of what I did
Jimmy look into what happens when the
orcs go through the portal do they hurt
anyone you ever think about that maybe
that portal is there pulled of the
freedom where Wow the yeah and really
you're the monster always have been
you're the owner you'd be okay with that
- yeah yeah and I'm just killed him
yeah sorry to blow things mine here some
no decorations
I'm gonna be okay
I'm gonna be okay
oh I accidentally got an old evil Lord
David says hey guys
David jumping it I finally decided to
stop procrastinating and learn how to
drive do either of you have any tips for
a new driver or things that you wish you
would have known when you were starting
out no thank you you're both hands
our audience pretty pretty young I spent
a we're old men we're very old
no I don't go slow just for you
make sure your mirrors can properly see
in the lane next to you I saw I saw this
thing online years ago much about how to
properly position your sideview mirrors
on your car and and its way wider hood
shit this is nice wait
oh shit hold on this I'm almost done
oh great and I think most people
position their sideview mirrors too
to kind of see the edge of their car and
if you if you spread out your sideview
mirrors to see it to the lane next to
you not the edge of your car come
perfect so that one tip of the fucking
one god damn it only one or got through
right it's all right
only one or it's all right yeah every
war mage in the order new of course to
stop the Horde forever and this other
exams are starting to be closed step
back through and see all the rifts
behind him with a gesture and a thought
a spare even the most waiting game is a
dear sweet ending when the rifts close
you're the last four major line and you
stop the or convey shilling medicine no
magic wraps groans come no more village
spells but no it works eating everyone
murdering everyone so really you'll need
less healing those works out and not
necessarily for the better I want to
encourage to make that choice one of the
order had in the end either courage or a
particular brand of stubborn stupidity
and then you might be the nightmare
hey I'm not doing that by the way your
your number one amongst your friends
yeah just saying it
anyone anyone who riches friends steam
step people only other difficulties are
better than me okay but look at that one
oh there you go I don't I don't play for
a high score I play for killing all the
orcs one got away you know just saying
uh what are we got here we got oh
there's tired and sad since speaking of
Paul Verhoeven neill blomkamp is
rebooting robocopy up the producers
who's who are also the original film's
screenwriters are saying it will be a
continuation of the original film which
is just fucking code for a soft reboot
and reference galore
hey it could be might be good I'm lettin
flack since cases showed my mom the
movie Logan she said it was her favorite
movie a since Mad Max fury road rich you
should give Logan a chance
I know I've never I don't care enough
about Wolverine and the x-men so I
didn't see it in the first place I never
got around to it
look I'm not seeing it before I see
Ragnarok yeah yeah I almost did when I
was at my brothers but the women folk
didn't want to watch it did you show
them shirtless Chris MJ I came home like
just gray look who's in this then I go
okay I've never read a comic says Len
flex in ski and loved it Jack clearly
fell asleep through half the movie and
missed Logan's clear character arc I you
know what actually I'd I think rich you
might like Logan yeah as someone who is
a fan of the x-men yeah I did not like
Logan yeah but I think everyone else who
is an x-men fan also like Logan that's
maybe I was just in a bad mood when I
watch everything's gonna be fine
wildlife industry says hey guys my
direct deposit just went through so that
means I get some IPA and you guys get $2
thanks for the stream
thank you wildlife industries and gruff
McMillan Terry says a big piece of Star
troopers satire i feel comes for people
who have served in the military not
saying that non veterans don't get it
just that for veterans there's even more
of a barbed message training deliberate
sense of false invincibility okay that
drop that's a that's a good perspective
gruff nick military if we are to assume
that the name macmillan terry means you
were in the military holy shit rich
hasn't seen Logan well as somebody who
hasn't been in a comic book shop and now
officially ten years yeah I go out and
religiously watch every comic book movie
like not only have you not been in a
comic book shop in a decade yeah you are
not particularly a fan of the x-men not
really I don't hate them the girls all
right but you've been very vocal about
how you're not into the x-men yeah so
you're not aware you're saying you're
not busting down the doors to see the
x-men movie the x-men is just too
daunting there's just too fucking many
of them yeah it's also it's also blur I
can understand why when you're in
there's a lot of rich lore yeah ah but
no someone looking from the outside that
that looks dense yes well that's what's
great about it is you know you take you
take a couple issues and you just go off
with two little characters they do their
thing they come back and then you go to
next characters and how people interact
with each other it's great it's great
it's all great okay now is the point in
the stream in which we thank all of you
lovely people who have subscribed to us
during this very stream much like van
Drance for twenty six fucking months in
a row who says insert reference here
rebel of old and flow pathetic for 22
months in a row
kick girl V 427 fucking months in a row
I last 1984's
for 37 mother motherfucking months in a
row I got confused I know I know I got
confused already I know I last 1984 well
you just did that one okay moving to
none to three slicer gang who says
thanks for all the great streams you
hack frauds jerath duros says there's
too many more months of riches boo berry
Thank You Col Ron 27 who says rich video
game original soundtracks on vinyl are
the shit I'm older than you and enjoy
vinyl for non hipster reason alright
I have FTL on vinyl it's amazing
Jack you're you're into D&D; now look for
Star frontiers it's a sci-fi game from
TSR that's just great
I've seen I've seen footage and the
youtubes of music and audio quality
aficionados you know in like the 80s
talking about how much of a bump up CDs
were now and now people are saying vinyl
is better I don't get it jack
it's you know don't get it it has to do
with compression okay
Ranko you see ladies man they're
compressed I get the nostalgia yeah
just having it feel like a collection I
get that yeah I get a nice big piece of
artwork too and that now that vinyl
sleeve I I have heard some dickheads and
I can only assume they're dickheads
because they're talking about file
insists that a vinyl legitimately does
sound better because to get the same
song on a CD you do have to digitally
compress it and then of course you're
running a digital signal
analog signal I've heard dickheads swear
that it does sound better I don't okay
if I can tell a difference but okay yeah
that's the thing like I don't really
have a I don't really have a dog in this
race no nigga do I yeah yeah neither do
I have no record player I don't
necessarily care about like the quad the
music sounds fine to me
all the music sounds fine to me vinyl
has a very distinct sound quality to it
yeah that's the scratchiness it's like
it's like when they put a grain filter
on in a video game
yeah oh I like I like it when it when it
what's like an old movie and it drops a
couple frames and boy warps that's great
looks great creepy g23 hideous oh seven
you have to do this next one's here oh
I'm sorry
I'm I've got to get back into other more
damn I think I think I think when I use
your ID I lean forward and I think it's
really important when you do this in
person
you let yeah you know Society a mouth
kind of go things inside to your neck I
think that health of the impression
okay so Godfather 42 and subscribe with
442 motherfucker my federal and he says
the latest rlm videos have have been
even better than usual so keep up the
great work
okay thank you thank you no I almost got
a confused the next week that's also 42
months in a row humberto Cabbage Patch
for 42 motherfucking months in a row
this is 42 never actually read
hitchhikers should I
I love hitchhikers the question is do
you read it or do you track down the
radios the radio plays here's the thing
the radio like
very wise there's a whole shit ton of
differences oh yeah yeah yeah there's a
there's a lot of there's a lot of radium
bits from the radio broadcast that just
never made it into the books there's
things that happen in the books for
different reasons than they did in the
radio playing there are there are
characters and the radio versions that
don't exist in the books so here's what
you do
ya read the book first then listen to
the radio play possibly yeah at least
the first well first looks great
yeah first two are really good I hate
the third I absolutely hate the third I
love the fourth book nobody else does
yeah I'm the only one who likes the
fourth book before the fourth one the
one the down to earth one where he goes
back to a earth a new earth that has
magically showed up but he just he tries
to live a normal life after all of the
weirdness he's experienced hmm and it's
got the less bizarre shit in it sure I
just I just like the change of pace it's
a neat take okay I mean I the fifth
one's bad too
I think though I think at very least the
first one is definitely worth a read
absolutely yeah absolutely
how come Dirk Gently is a TV show not
Hitchhiker's hitch I could be a better
TV show than a movie it would be to be
fair Dirk Gently was a bad TV show okay
okay
why but why was it a TV show no I mean
why can't we get a new that's what I'm
trying to say Jake I'm trying to think
of a real answer to give you
yeah because one was already a movie and
so downgrading it to a TV show he sucked
the movie did suck but it's still a
downgrade people people in the business
still consider TV less than movies okay
even though that's absolutely not true
you have more yeah people in the
business still see that and so like oh
no like anyone who owns that property
whoever owns the the film rights to
hitchhikers don't want to downgrade and
whoever owned Dirk Gently rights no one
well it was people what were people do
with Dirk Gently nothing yeah they were
probably it's probably easier to obtain
those rights which is why we got a Dirk
Gently show yeah I totally totally love
hitchhikers yep yeah you know season one
of Dirk Gently was kind of alright
season 2 was a hot garbage and even
season one was barely passable because
Elijah Wood is good and and for the
friend and and neither hold a candle to
Dirk gently's holistic detective agency
the book they both get it so wrong but
anyway go ahead
we're just for the person who asked the
chance what what word the book we're
talking about cuz they might have missed
it yes is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the
galaxy followed followed by a restaurant
at the end of the universe yes life the
universe everything was the third they
have so many names right yes they have
so many names and that written by
Douglas Adams the same man who wrote the
books for Dirk Gently yes and you know
what much like the hitchhikers book
really only the first Dirk Gently is
good
second the second the second book for
hitchhikers is good restaurant at the
end the universe is good it blurs man it
all blurs together mmm well because
hitchhikers isn't isn't really about
like telling one solid tale it's just a
number of different bits with some kind
of vague story tying it all together but
really here's a funny idea here's a
funny idea here's a funny idea right so
that's why it blurs the structure isn't
like here's the beginning middle and end
it's like here's the thing that happens
here's a weird thing that happens yeah
then this happens but it's all amusing
projecting you like because it was
adapted from series of radio plays which
were literally every episode
story here's a story here's the story
yes oh that's all yeah everything's crap
the second circuit gently book is
strange but fine its Hitchhiker's Guide
is like Robot Chicken yes but with a lot
of the same characters tying everything
together neither now they're on this
planet and his weird thing that happens
on this planet and now they go to this
section of space there's a weird thing
that happens in this section of the
space yeah and now we're gonna have a
segue where the book narrates chapter
from the Hitchhiker's Guide the book
within the book has the thing to say
about something that's not really
related it's kind of Monty Python in
space yeah yeah like um like what's the
the history of Earth or the history of
the world no no no that's Mel Brooks
yeah life wait not now for something
completely different is that the movie
that was a bunch of little vignettes
yeah yeah it was like that it was like
the TV Cheryl but as a movie but that's
cuz the TV shows justiça sketches right
right it's now for something completely
different
know the meaning of life pirate XCore
did you ever see the meaning of life
Monty Python's the meaning of life yeah
that's the movie I'm thinking of where
it's a bunch of it's a bunch of
vignettes
which one was and now for something
completely different that might have
just been like a best-of of the show my
turn okay that might have just been the
best of the skits from the show okay
yeah I'm thinking I'm thinking of
meaning of life yeah right anyway sorry
that went off on a whole thing look I
was funny that this came up I was I was
listening to some old hitchhikers radio
stuff last night yeah on my head sure
sure
read it humberto
and then listen to it and listen to it
because there's quite a bit of
difference between the two noble Jade

yeah I had to go to church recently
really over the weekend yeah my cousin
was in town had a new baby getting a
baptised okay gotta go to church I
thought it was just gonna be the baptism
like I even went to baby get dunked in
water full-blown church when at what
point did they do the baptism like after
no midway dad be rude and it's like it's
like full-blown Catholic Church and I
don't know if you've ever been to
Catholic Church yeah a lot of standing
and sitting I know it's a lot of crawl
and repeat it's just like no but you
know what the standing and city breaks
things up a little bit oh they do the
baptism and you just stand up you say
thank you I now have better things to do
with my time and you announce that
loudly and then you walk out yes yes

against it it's like I sniff I would
have known beforehand that it was
full-blown Church like I would have gone
because you know you get you kids
baptized that come to its out come to
see the baptism you know yeah but it was
it was just one of those things where
you know my kids already like my kids

I it was it was so weird man it was so
weird I loved him it was so different
I'll take Sealab over Space Ghost coz
that's good that's great Sealab is good
but like Space Ghost is like the
granddaddy of all Adult Swim programming
like Sealab or of the Space Ghost was
proto Adult Swim just like what if what
if we could do like weird shit while the
kids are asleep
oh yeah yeah Space Ghost is great like I
had the brac album was the birth of
Adult Swim yeah yeah yeah it was this it

like defunct row blonde thanks for
subscribing development heck says I
finished Stephen King's new book great
premise and situation wait I'm not even
gonna read the rest terrible ending
really falls apart of the
I was drowning immediately but the
ending didn't live up to the story that
seems to be his friend is this your
first Stephen King here's the thing
about Stephen King III think it's very
easy to joke about Stephen King because
literally that's every single one of his
book yeah every single one every single
one but that man needs to be respected
just for his output alone he just he
works we can make 200 shitty videos a
month jack yeah we could wouldn't be
worthy of respect but you know what if a
couple of them got picked up for
feature-length movies then we'd have a
pretty sweet deal it may be fine
nah he's working man that he's just put
putting out putting out doesn't need to
be perfect that's that's a Stephen King
is a is motivation for all of you young
artists out there doesn't need to be
perfect doesn't need to have a good
ending just get it out someone will buy
it chance bringing up misery as a
Stephen King work then doesn't fall
apart at the end I've never read I
haven't read it either but the movie
yeah that was fine I don't think that I
had a letdown ending well so is the
shining but Stephen King hated the
adaptation of The Shining House the
ending of the book difference.i I don't
know okay just different okay it's just
different like the worst is needful
things which one's needful things I
think just magic veins come out of his
watch and and kill the bad guy just
randomly completely randomly magical
beam comes out of his watch
I think of editions watch that also like
has like flowers come out of it but in
this case sends a magical beam that
kills the bad guy in the book the hotel
blows up
it says unit 603 idiot shanks ending is
good Wow okay our shank is amazing look
look look look when you write 800 books
some of them by chance are gonna like he
has 800 books and you guys have
mentioned like maybe one and a half
endings are good this is what you're
reaching for here no but again it
doesn't need to be perfect just remember
that for your own work Stephen King is a
famous author and most of his books fall
apart at the end you can do it live your
dreams don't let your dreams be dreams

worker in the Batman return of the Joker
where was that Tim or was that that
might have been Tim yeah I don't I don't
know what happened to dick I guess I
didn't watch I didn't watch Batman

construction worker

osmium buckshot says a cheer shared
words for own up that's the thing that
happens I think automatically Oh
shared reward with 47 others in the chat
but I don't think it's a message they
left before your automated thing we got
there on the floor every now and then
they assured of what 47 others I don't
find no nubes awakened casual horse -
horse 31 fucking months in a row use

how long has it been my twenty sixth
month anniversary Zoom Li one month
presumably Lenten flexin ski for 22
months in a row who says who's a better
character
Nux or furiosa
they're both good they're both good
either will good there you know what
they're both good and more importantly
they're complimentary of each other yes
they they work well as part of the
ensemble so there you go i Knox's arcus
fun and furious and furiosa of course is
you know they anchor the movie but you
know you know the the depressing part of
that movie what everyone ends up right
back where they started but do they
but do they but rich we were the real
monster the whole time Lux's he's
expected to give his life for his his
God King and then he finds his way out
of that but in the end he ends up
sacrificing his life just for someone
else but someone he loves but it was his
show but it was his choice that's the
difference every time but max he's he's
once he's captured they forced him to be
somebody's blood bag you know in the end
he ends up giving blood to furiosa by
choice mm-hmm yeah yeah I just I just
think that's an interesting little thing
running through fury road yeah but a lot
of the characters doing exactly what
they were doing in the beginning but on
their own terms now it's it's kind of
like it's a fucking good movie yeah it's
kind of like it's a damn good movie okay
where we up what oh I'm just gonna be
seeing what they're saying in chat
I guess for those who don't know yet not
knucks and furios are characters in Mad
Max fury road I would expect everyone to
know that because Mad Max fury road is
just an awesome fucking movie and it's
something we talk about all the time and
how about how it's an awesome movie it's
one of the best movies ever made
possibly my favorite movie fucking great
great movie and yes mr. plinkus yes rich
is being all arty-farty and it's great
and occasionally and it's great okay we
already did that one how about a black
mark we need to get away from the
Citadel oh wait no we have to go back
the city blood but we're choosing to go
back oh yeah it's in there it's in there
I mean it's in there and every bit of it
right at the end do they turn the water
on
is there a scene where they turn the
water on for everyone Lea because how
quickly by the lane how quickly is
furiosa gonna realize that she really
needs to start rationing that water and
she's gonna be the one cutting it off
how quickly is that gonna happen like
pretty pretty fucking quick and then
she's gonna need somebody to defend that
city because of all that fucking water
jisu she did some she's gonna need some
war boys to fight for her it's
ultimately a very depressing film well
but so fun oh that's why it stops it
does there's a reason that the movie
stops there because you don't need to
think about anything else beyond that
you don't need to think about the fact
that now max doesn't have a car and is
walking out on his own survives that all
the time and he's lost like three pints
of blood this happen to max like eight
times and there's only been four movies
that's great it's great but no it's it's
filled with like rich said it's filled
with that that mirroring uh-huh the
movies
arts with you know the turning out of
the water and the rationing of it in the
it ends with the turning on the water
but in victory it's great okay
we are at Black List did we get Anubis
awakened I did earlier okay and this is
a we another weird duplicate where it
says a cheer you said a black mark to
did okay Lou so you just did that one
example I scrolled up and I lost my spot
I notice it as I was saying it to be
fair but it's a short name I couldn't
really stop where I could take a leer
and that would just be awkward no they
just finished it was just great because
like you had like three senior moments
in a row but did you do the next one
okay then you definitely didn't like
this like Mad Max fury road is a great
movie did you know then that there's a
mirroring and Mad Max fury
