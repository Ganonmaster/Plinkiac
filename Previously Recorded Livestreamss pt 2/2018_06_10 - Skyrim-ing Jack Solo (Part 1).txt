our Xtreme button hello hello can you
hear me is this even happening is this
even happening we're gonna start we're
gonna start and just kind of hope it
happens here's my Skyrim did my second
PC work nope I just went back to the
original PC second PC didn't work it's
working
hello hello everybody we are only an
hour late today you're welcome you're
welcome yeah I got past the tutorial and
started playing a little bit just so I
would be comfortable with the controls
what's wrong with you I don't really
care about e3 so I'd it doesn't matter
to me you see aa new PC the the new PC
is right there I'm actually I'm reading
chat through the new PC right now it's
it's the the screen is right over there
you guys can't see it obviously I'm
reading chat through the new PC but I'm
not streaming through the new PC because
nothing is working nothing is working my
friends yeah this is Skyrim on the
switch because I figured I'd get more
play time through it that way let me
just get this up and running Oh
everything is just terrible so what was
happening with my new streaming PC which
is all here and and great I'll talk
about Witcher 3 latchkey kid remind me
to talk about which are three another
time please because I'm going through
other stuff right now let's um let's go
to boom-boom let's go where am I going
to
what it kept saying what my new PC kept
saying was I needed to go and enable the
direct3d acceleration
within all the the Ghibli job and when I
went into DX diag the direct3d
acceleration was enabled and so I don't
know why that wasn't working and that's
why I haven't been that's fine go leave
watches that's fine it does xsplit work
with integrated graphics I guess I just
assumed that xsplit works with
integrated graphics but I'm gonna have
to figure that out I'm gonna have to
figure that out I guess I just assumed
that because I have the because I have
the elgato capture card that would take
care of most of the processing and you
know but we'll see did we get a
dedicated streaming box yet I did but
I'm not streaming on it because it's not
working and I don't know why it's not
working I'm very very sorry
I'm very very sorry ok all right let me
get this over here we're gonna do a
bunch of stuff here hold on hold on for
just one second we're gonna I don't have
rich here and so kind of everything's a
little broken everything's a little
broken and I'm not even playing on the
TV
everything's broken and nothing is like
it I'm used to here we go
look at that look at my bar that's my
barbarian lady that's a doc that's what
I named her at a doc oh here we go hey
hey welcome this is a doc I thought that
was a good barbarian name got a
sweet-ass mace right there cool face
paint there's no great suburbs Kerkar
yes in the streaming pc there is no
graphics card at all because we don't
really need one
is she a Nord yes she's a Nord
so the idea was you know to save a
little bit of money we wouldn't really
need a graphics card because we could
just stream with the onboard graphics
and apparently that's not working I
don't know if we need even even just an
entry-level graphics card just except
you need one to do or to run Direct X
right that's what it's sounding like
it's oh it's sounding like we're gonna
need just a bottom-of-the-barrel
graphics card just to run the graphics
processor to run xsplit which is a
little malarkey because you know the the
whole idea of the streaming only PC was
that it wouldn't be as expensive as a
regular gaming PC but I guess we'll see
luckily I did get the oh yeah I want to
talk to this dude I want to see what's
up with him
came over here
since the first gray Mane's came to
Whiterun skyforge steel is all the
companions will use for good reason
yeah we all should be praised ad hoc
let's see here what do you got here
iron arrows pickaxe I've got a bit who
is a nice battle axe
I got a mace oh that's a steel mace
there's that better than my mace because
I really like my mace what's my mace
hold on we're gonna check that out real
oh I have an iron mace I only do 10
damage steel mace does what does 11
damage yeah I'll keep my iron mace I'll
be able to just sell some shit to you
though
I kinda want my steel or X no I'm fine
all right great thanks bye you I saw
this cool ass 4G and I wanted to talk to
this guy but uh talk say cheese
hey it's a channel drop but oz talks HW
is a pretty good source for cheap GPUs
yeah and that's why he read the minimum
requirements I thought I did read the
minimum requirements and you know like I
thought I guess in my head
software minimum requirements shouldn't
involve a graphics card yeah I don't
know but I'm not too worried about it I
I'm sure we can pick up a cheap graphics
card for some amount of money but until
then we'll just use the old streaming PC
unfortunately I uh I overestimated my
own my own ability here we had a whole I
had a whole different situation where
the entire motherboard I got the entire
motherboard I got was fried the pins for
the CPU were all bent but I didn't
realize it until I had built the whole
thing I built the entire PC got
everything all together nice up and
running and then it wouldn't work and I
couldn't figure out why it wasn't
turning on at all I was getting no no
nothing whatsoever finally luckily the
motherboard I had has a kind of an
onboard diagnostic thing and it was
telling me my CPU was faulty so I took
my CPU no I took the cooler off got all
the thermal paste off took the CPU out
of the socket and discovered that a
bunch of the pins on the motherboard
were bent miss ah it must have happened
during shipping or somehow and luckily I
was able to get that replaced in time to
build it this morning but that was a
little
but that was a little much let's go out
into the wilderness and see if we can
mess up some people are things and I'm
playing this on the switch so there are
no mods that I know of and I'm kind of
just going for that that vanilla
playthrough just you know hang out do
some stuff check out what's the big deal
about Skyrim already it's it's alright
it's pretty fun though I did I did my
first mission
my first mission was to was to kill I
got a job to kill a bandit leader and I
just I I wanted to go in stealthily but
apparently I've really failed that going
stealthily and just so they saw me and I
just went in May swinging and killed
everyone I think accidentally which is
unfortunate because like I didn't really
know what don't jump off I didn't really
know what was happening I'm pretty sure
I shouldn't have won that battle but oh
well
and oh my oh I don't know I don't know
if I want to become a werewolf I did get
a cool spell that I'm hoping to try out
I got they uh
I got a no that's not what I wanted to
do hey still figuring out like the basic
is a conjuration yeah I got a raise
zombie spell I'm really excited about
that reanimate a weak dead body to fight
for you for 60 seconds that's cool
so I wanna you know I'm gonna murder
someone and then I'm gonna revive them
they can help me kill their friends it's
gonna be great
super excited about that I had to do
that the classic slow walk back from my
first mission because I wanted
everything I just wanted fucking all the
loot wanted all the loot
there's no I don't know what's it what's
a grant what's the minimum graphics card
how much am I gonna have to spend on a
graphics card minimum for for exploit
that's my question
you buy stuff from me how about that and
what are you gonna buy this food for cut
all this food I don't think I need it
unless I can cook later buy this for
anything all these weird I have all
these weird ingredients that I'm not
quite sure what they do yet no the book
of the Dragonborn no no I was
oh wait I think I want to think I want
to read that hold on first yes my first
time playing Skyrim I think I have a I
think I have a new magic spell here yes
new spell I love that by the way that's
actually something that I truly truly
dig is that you can pick up books and
and that's that's what teaches you
spells is like you have to read a book
and then you get to learn a spell that's
super cool
key ingredients that say what they can
about okay great oh I'm sorry Studio
Highland $38 right there thank you
Tiberius Kirk $38 graphics card that's
what I'm looking for if that's the
minimum for exploit whatever the minimum
is $38 an end 21 d3 GeForce graphics
card I love it all right we're gonna go
which we do oh you know what I have some
missions how do I get to my missions
again I think over here quests let's
visit the shrine of Azura how about that
where's the shrine of Azura
map
the shrine of Azura is very far away hey
let's not visit the shrine of Azura
let's see what else we got
visit the college at winterhold
how close is that maybe that's a little
goddamn it that's further away I guess
we'll just start heading that way and
see what happens all right let's just
head that way and maybe we'll find a
bear or something it'll be great screams
fighting mechanics is simpler than a
brick yes I I keep waiting I kept
waiting for like the fight to have a
little more oomph to it but holy cats
it's it's it's linked to the past
style of combat where it's just just
just swing away swing for the fences I
was trying to do like a little like
shield block could they have like put
that way I was trying to do like more
shield blocks to get them off they're
off balance but that didn't seem to do
anything no we're just gonna head this
way it just well we're just gonna walk
into the mountains that's my that's my
plan here
you highly suggest the companioning
quest I don't know I don't know is that
a giant to the right I see no giant I'm
sorry she's gonna head into these
mountains though
that's my plan she's gonna see what kind
of we're gonna or just gonna go out into
the wilderness I'm a barbarian these
mountains right in front of me look
inviting it's gonna be great or terrible
great or oh my god I got caught on a
stick there's no giant I'm not gonna
fight a giant I'm prime most definitely
not ready to fight a giant almost
certainly I'm hoping for like ah see
look I like a wolf maybe I can take out
a wolf
yeah got you a wolf that's exactly what
I was hoping for it's just a dumb bull
fight wolf pelt boom taking your skin
yeah took it got it alright great

a little magic now because I have a
healing magic and magic that's great

Hey okay good good
if I ever play the PC hell reevaluate
the bono you know what I don't actually

always just forget to equip it I don't
mind the bow the most fine I just
thought they were friends I thought they
were friends I thought they could be
friends and apparently I mean there are
they the bandits is that it that's good
I think these are bandits and not
friends so it's fine I'll just take all
their stuff taken gold arrows zillion
arrows think I have some iron arm up
some better armor now so let's go look
at that yeah
I just think the helmets are dumb
looking
I mean that iron-on was kind of dumb
looking too but I'll go in
it's a way that I can is there a way I
can add items to my quick list cuz that
would be great because I want to switch
between my shield yes I can
nice that's great where's my light
that's pretty good that's my favorite
and then add the bow to my favorite
great alright now I think I'm getting
the hang of this alright so sir oh can I
get in over here maybe let's see what
this thing is you an entrance yeah you
are
Rob laughs an hour will you still be
streaming during the Bethesda conference
am stream until you know whatever I'm
streaming till 1:00 whenever I'm just
hanging out and playing some Skyrim
not the first person for that yeah
I can't use you oh shit what did I do
oh I was doing ray zombies I want sparks
yeah eat it I was trying to raise the
zombie I'm gonna right now I'm gonna
raise you as a zombie to fight any
friends see if we've come across any
friends dingus what are you
solid dwarven metal what yeah what do
you got on you I pick great
oh you have fun watching the Xbox
conference
I hope you have I hope you have a good
time you know
sometimes in the past I've enjoyed
watching them live it's not anything I
need really to watch them live so so
we're here and that's just gonna be fine
have you - my favorite and
we're gonna try to be sneaky
because there could be bad guys around
any corner considered a chair if I
wanted to
a dwarven arrow
it helps it I always prayer to
what
ya dingus how did he hear me I was
sneakin take your take your gold tinkle
we got here we got some beds
my sneak increase today so that's
something
add when mere cog
please give me totally sell me
there we go oh there's another one over
there that's why let's light him on fire
you're on fire now you know the combat
needs a little needs a little work as
its you know it's just whack whack whack
whack quick but I also know that it's
not necessarily about the combat it's
it's about the adventure and the who
amethyst
pick you know it's about the fact that I
just walked up a mountain and there
happened to be just a little dwarf and
dungeon down here and that's great that
is fucking great dude
there are another bed dude I was pretty
sure there was yes actually I was
planning on streaming in just as to
today I swear there was another kind I
was finding on streaming and justice to
today but I feel like that's a game that
would take up a little too much of my
concentration and because it's comic
book II stuff I thought that would that
that would be more fun if it was rich
and I streaming that so I'm waiting no I
don't want the wooden plate so yeah I
thought they'd be more fun as a rich and
I stream dish and we'll wait until he is
feeling better he's feeling a little
sick today that's why he's not here
do you need any food another thing you
need
okay that's an expert unlock I'm not an
expert on Locker so I'm not going to try
to do that
I would rather watch it as thin and just
say well you that that's why I like like
I said if it's rich and I we can talk
comic-book stuff and we could oh shit
and hey let's check out that imperial
bowl
not that one to that one okay okay
and this has most emotionai me whether
it's good or not is a nice actually that
might just be more distracting sometimes
sometimes I find motion aiming very
helpful sometimes I find it more
distracting than anything
I keep wanting to think that some of
these people are friends gold because
those guys didn't get up to attack me
what if they're friends what if they're
like they're like being captured I don't
want to just kill them and then they're
like oh we OH
a consortium key nice like we were being
held by the bandits is that the
consortium we'll figure that out later
we gotta how do I have a level up know
who I do have a level up what are we
gonna do what are we gonna do I did
health last time so let's do stamina
this time and then let's see here I
think I did I did a restoration last
time I did like a novice restoration I
don't know if that did me any good loop
excuse me that wasn't done leveling up
yet
that's eration no I am I have no idea
what any of these things mean you know I
know these are things that can kind of
go up automatically as you use them you
know let's move let's write let's raise
my pickpocket let's do that
I want to I feel like I want to steal
stuff from people Jack you have a heart
of gold I have a heart of gold and
Who am I detected by
I don't know how you made it this far
but you'll go no farther oh oh okay
shit Oh friend yeah I was here to talk
to you I was here to talk to you and
have a good time
oh no oh shit and I died
that's actually my first time dying I
definitely should have aired him I
thought he was gonna be my friend but uh
apparently not oh I got to do all this
over again yeah I don't know I know you
know what no I know arrow arrow all
these motherfuckers
yeah sneak increase a ton that we know
that's stuff on the floor Jack you could
have set it on fire and cut oh that's
good to know
old block pick oh wait now you had an
arrow to that my arrow and I might I'm
just taking my arrows out of his corpse
which I'm totally okay with take all
this stuff again
there another guy like here forget
it's great
it's all great this is Nicky this is a
neat game and I get it you know I think
I get it why my people are so into this
game it's you know me I think it that
word is bad there's a guy behind the
pillar right oh no I'm moving faster
this time
oh shit okay we're gonna flames and
we're gonna go I don't have my
we got him we got him we got him do we
but do we know
I've got a little heel area there we go
everything's fine
shit
the combat is so clunky the combat is so
so very clunky which you know I guess
we're just gonna have to be okay with
it's just it's really it's just
something I need to get used to but very
very clunky lock pick of course I'm
taking all the lock picks gold great
like and I could play in third-person I
suppose I just you know just trying to
figure out which one is is the better
fit
I forget I forget where these other
dudes are so we've got to be a little
more sneaky now
use faster weapons it's lunch clunky can
I level up already because I didn't
because I didn't save after it leveled
up let's look at stamina again man yeah
one okay I wanna I want to be a sneaky
pic bot I want to be a barbarian
pickpocket makes perfect sense and then
what I'm gonna do is be really smart and
safe boom Savin
gonna have a little afternoon coffee
just got to show hot take how's the
sneaking going you know I died I died
once I don't think I need to use my
points to level up one handing skill cuz
I keep a living leveling that up by just
using a one-handed weapon
so I don't think I need to worry about
spending my points on leveling up one
handedness because I can just use my one
a handed weapon and level up naturally
like that
No okay
just hate the ruins of azor Merrik that
way that where I am
I kill I kill are you people that's
right that's right
rabbie if you can sneak right up behind
someone if you're sneak is good enough
you get extra damage that way yeah let's
be sneaky then let's be sneaky and need
any of you
just gonna walk really slowly because I
think there's a guy there's guys over
here we're gonna try to take him out
because we know they're here this time
so let's get our imperial bow right away
and
I knew it okay well that was much easier
fine clothes I can get some money for
those
well that was much easier just food
man it one of you had an annoyed in with
that
one of you had a key on you if I
remember which one of you had a key on
you bolts Jim whoo nice oh oh shit now I
got too much shit on me I did the thing
I did the thing where I have too much
shit on me I start drinking my wine
eating some cabbage
damnit what can I put down
drop you they don't really help
I'm not wearing any of you I don't care
about you don't care about you how's
that no not yet and and we're go there
we go
nope still over all right no no shit
well fuck it's gonna have to be fine you
got the key
great
Oh all fake III is all fake trailers
it's true
can't I said can I sell the do a mere
medal cuz if I can sell that for a
decent price then I want to hold on to
it right what can I do what can I sell
the metal for the giant mace in my hand
the one that I'm using I'm using the
giant mace in my hand so I'd like to
keep that I have a bunch of this stuff
that I can like I want to keep the
pickaxe second I'm not really using the
war axe is that a one-handed weapon yeah
I guess I can drop the macing just keep
the keep the axe amazed I mean that's
thirteen wait right there
hunting bow I'm not really using oh that
that's a hundred and thirty-five gold
though be nice just 20 damage look at
that thing
Oh dog I mean you know you just kind of
want to keep that because it's cool
drop the Dwemer metal
you guys keep saying I should drop the
do a mere medal which almost makes me
want to not drop it because I think I
think you guys are messing with me
like this uh let's make the this a
favorite and then let's make our steel
war axe a favorite
that's gonna get somebody's attention
oh well you've raised a zombie let's go
raise azam be
come on come on oh I can't raise you oh
did I hit the bow is that my problem
don't try something
yeah drop it jack keep in mind how much
it weighs and how much you get is sure
and I guess like I'm not super concerned
about goal right now but now yeah yeah
be my zombie come on oh yeah you're
gonna be must come on look at no Liam
yeah like an arrow in his head let's go
zombie what am I
where'd my zombie go yeah they are oh he
wants to get a weapon awesome
Oh
okay
oh shit oh shit well he killed me right
quickly didn't he killed me like right
away
yeah that's not be kind of a weak-ass
zombie I really should have been firing
arrows into that guy when my zombie was
fighting him that was my fault
we're gonna we've we've learned some
lessons and we're gonna and not pick up
so much metal this time I'm gonna keep a
little bit of it to see how much money
would make out of it which metal do I
have right now
get a broom oh it's only 20 yeah we can
drop that oh I see I see what you're
saying it isn't really not worth a lot I
absolutely see what you're saying all
right I'm with you I get you your
conjuring skill determines how powerful
your zombie is okay well I still think I
want to conjure one just so I can you
know up my skill run up your skill level
let's take a look at our weapons here
right turn you into a favorite all right
because that seems like the smart thing
to do right
and shop
I'm on motion controls
what oh you went to go investigate where
the arrow went I get you oh shit
dick shot okay okay okay okay
and the steelworks
sing mercy I'm sorry sir I was not
listening to you
okay great we did it
we did it everything's fine everything's
gonna be fine I'm gonna save now after
this as soon as I take all their shit
we're gonna save Dan we're gonna raise
one of them as a zombie search want that
yeah these fine clothes go for go for
just as much as all that metal and there
they are significantly lighter so yes
you all are right to that metal was
worthless a key great you know let's do
a little more exploring first let's
let's try to be smart and I know we're
not usually smart and by we I of course
mean me but I'm trying here
uh-huh I was there a whole second way in
here and I could have like sprung those
arrows oh that's cool oh if I if I had
if I had decent lock-picking
I could have sprung a trap I get it I
get it that's neat that's neat see
that's fun
that's fun
big guys oh oh you know what I didn't

oh come on oh no we almost did it this
time we almost did it perks give you
bucks and make your skills stronger all
right well that's you know I the that
time I feel like was our closest that
was the closest so we get a zombie we
shoot arrows in the guy we light him on
fire right like we we got we got the
makings of a thing here now I just got
to get good that's the thing here now we
know that's not what I want the last
part of the equation is me just getting

it's not helping shit
damn it stop it fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
come in Thank You Fisto of groovy um
might be too high level I I feel like
I'm close now you know the one of my
issues right now is I'm still I haven't
internalized all of the controls yet and
I'm still stumbling over just how to do
basic stuff like I keep trying to I keep
trying to run and that's the Crouch
button cuz there nope
there is no run button that I know of
you guys are about to tell me what the
run button it's not sure but because
there is so a lot of it is mean just
like I said it's it's I'm struggling
with the basic controls which it's fine
because I haven't really been playing
the game for for that long
and so I'm just gonna be oh my god he
takes them on so fast alright so now we
get that flames on
I got this I got this oh no I do not
have this healing
all right now let's go to our items and
try some potions because I think I have
potions that have my minor healing
potions
they have some minor stamina potions too
all right
you can I can I can tow this Jack
levelling-up fully restores you well I'm
I'm not I don't think I'm leveled up or
what what I'll get there I'll get there
guys we can do this we got a hold we got
a whole plan here hit upon the other
part is now my zombies getting them too
early come on zombie we can do this I
believe in us
come on zombie hey hey zombie
oh no oh oh God
see like that I was trying to get to all
of my potions and I kept pressing the
wrong buttons you can equip the zombie
before I wake him oh yeah okay that was
even closer okay now I got it I have to
be more on the offensive when my zombie
gets there I want to equip my zombie
before I wake him and then we're gonna
take I really want to take out this guy
how do I equip him cuz he had a sword
right didn't he have a sword yeah he has
a great sword on him
but he doesn't take it why doesn't he
take it
I know about leveling up but I can't
level up my side my skills are the way
there is guys keep saying leveling up so
now where's your sword
where's your sword my dude you know do
it mid-fight Oh am i leveling up
mid-fight I could have leveled up during
the fight huh
okay I see now I see them I'm gonna
level up now I love our stamina again
nice and then let's level up
our sneak I feel like we should have
more sneak
nope but but I feel like we're learning
I definitely feel like we're learning he
learned something that I learned
something new every time so like that
time though our zombie did nothing our
zombie was not helpful at all so you
know what let's look at let's look at
something here let's look at our our
steal arrows do 10 damage and what am i
using am I using I'm using iron arrows
which I'm going to do 8 damage dwarven
arrows do 14 damage you see what I'm
saying here like let's use our steel
arrows okay now let's get our zombie
ready
we can do this take this guy out and
it's gonna be great this is this is a
team effort you are absolutely right we
are gonna do this though trick him into
going over there then we shoot in the
back what I didn't even get it I didn't
even get a chance to level up there I
didn't even get a chance to level up
there everything's you get to determined
to kill one random bandit out of I do
faceful groover you're absolutely right
like I am I am I'm slightly obsessed
with this bandit just because it seems
like I should be able to kill him you
know
it seems like I should be able to kill
him and it's upsetting to me that that I
can't I know like I'm not super leveled
yet but I also want to go deeper into
this cave
Jack has a tendency for obsession I do I
absolutely do
arrows while the zombie engages I I just
need to get I don't know I don't know
what I need I need a lot I need a lot
you know okay here's here's what here's
my real plan this is my real plan here
oh my god I got a new I got a new plan
one ray zombie buttons buttons
to
get that guy interested so that my
zombie what are you doing now yeah
you're gonna go fight him right well I
get my zombie reason points so that's
something
you see me well you don't see me
I thought I had a decent plan there yeah
yeah no I have okay new plan I got a
great new plan don't worry I got this I
got a great great new plan we are gonna
go full sneak this time and I'm not
gonna be dumb and fire arrows like I did
last time this is gonna be great I'm not
gonna fight him at all
I'm gonna go right around him come on
zombie you are gonna be my backup
you're gonna be my dummy and he's just
gonna he's just gonna think it's all
about the zombie this is gonna be great
all right so now we're gonna spook him
into going that way
let's get our axe back okay
you saw me didn't work
shit didn't work why am i crouching
we're gonna get out of here we're gonna
get it I'm gonna get my zombie points
and we're gonna get out of here that's
what I'm gonna do I thought I thought
okay all right new plan new plan
this this is this is going to have way
this is going absolutely terribly but
that's okay all right new plan
we're gonna do this do this Wow oh shit
okay
there now we're gonna run away I got my
zombie points and we're gonna run away
boom easy peasy
bye sorry zombie friend
okay moving on
can you just run away sure why not I did
I ran away yes I know the oil and the
floor can catch fire too but that didn't
really seem to do anything so I got my
zombie point and I ran away I did the
the only heroic thing I could think of I
ran away
we'll go fight some wolves again yeah
you know that's a defeat what are you
gonna do that looks like a drop
good choice running away ad it never
feels good never feels good to run away
you know if I was like with that with
that uh the skeleton guy from before
that was the case where I was just
clearly outgunned there was there was no
there was no amount of skill that would
have saved me there but here it felt
like there were times when I was close
enough that I should have been able to
make it work I should have been able to
I can't get in I should have been able
to make it work
there's a whole thing in here so that's
a defeat which sucks but hey what are
you gonna do the answer of course
there's nothing you got I did I got
close I got close enough times where my
stubbornness wanted to take over and
just just you know keep pounding my head
against the brick wall until I dented
the wall and I know that was the bad
call but that's what I felt like you
know so we'll see what's over here we'll
keep exploring whoa hey yeah big guy
Oh Elk lolo elk
that's a cool thing to come back to oh
yeah I'm jump sure everything's fine
everything's gonna be fine
we're gonna go see if we can find any
more what's this there's anything
probably not I don't know
