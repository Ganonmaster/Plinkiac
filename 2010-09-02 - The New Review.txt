Palpatine: Arise, Lord Plinkett. The time has come.
Plinkett: Ain't nobody asked you.
Palpatine: What?
Plinkett: Quiet your facehole.
Palpatine: I have foreseen this day for a long, long time.
Plinkett: Yeah, my new review is done. It's Star Trek.
Palpatine: What?
Plinkett: I just finished it yesterday.
Palpatine: What?
Plinkett: It's up on my webzone, redlettermedia.com.
Palpatine: You have failed me for the last time.
Plinkett: Look, I'll review Episode III next, I guess. Probably. I just needed a break from Star Wars.
Palpatine: What in the fuck is Star Wars?
Plinkett: Huh?
Palpatine: Your destiny was to review Mobile Suit Gundam Crossfire, and how it totally ruined Kidou Senshi Ze Gundam: Hot Scramble. It was total bullshit that they would even release a game like that for PlayStation.
Plinkett: Hey, wait a minute. Are you at the mall?
Palpatine: I had to pick up a few things. Look, I have this list. Next, you will need to review Metal Gear 3. Then after that, you should review Dragonball Z: Bardock, The Father of Goku.
Plinkett: Hey. Hey, stop.
Palpatine: And lastly, you should review the World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King expansion pack...
Plinkett: Hey, quiet.
Palpatine: ...and how it totally ruined the first expansion pack...
Pliinkett: Hey, quiet.
Palpatine: ...called Burning Crusade. And that basically ruined World of Warcraft.
Plinkett: Hey, stop. Do you have an erection?
Palpatine: Yes.
