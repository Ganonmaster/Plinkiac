ON a cold night in early December a young crowd packed into the cozy 72-seat screening room at the 92Y TriBeCa. The film that was about to be shown would be accompanied by live commentary from the hosts of “The Flop House,” a podcast dedicated to bad movies. Those hosts were two moonlighting writers from “The Daily Show,” Dan McCoy and Elliott Kalan, and their laconic friend Stuart Wellington. After a short introduction, the three sat in the front row as the lights went down.

The movie started, and Mr. McCoy’s voice came over the sound system. “Oh, ‘Argo.’ I’d wanted to see this.”

This set up a big laugh for when the film’s actual title card appeared. It read “Bratz: The Movie,” in a garish font. The camera panned to a sunny cul-de-sac, then cut to a girl’s bedroom, where an ornate pink alarm clock started ringing.

“Wow, even their clocks have bratitude,” Mr. Kalan said, a deadpan reference to the shopworn portmanteau of the toy line Bratz.

The movie unspooled from there, a mix of consumerist fantasy (there are multiple sequences of girls trying on clothes), banal girl-power rhetoric and frequent moments of confounding badness. Twenty minutes in, text appeared on the screen to say that the action was about to cut two years into the future for no discernible reason. The crowd was apoplectic. The commentators gave out halfhearted cries. Mr. Kalan speculated that the movie was about to enter a post-apocalyptic future, but of course it immediately returned to a suburban high school. “Bratz” is packed with weird moments like this, and they seemed to get more outlandish as the audience got more beery.

Funny, raucous bad-movie nights have become an important part of the 92Y TriBeCa’s programming. The film programmer there, Cristina Cacioppo, estimated that one-fourth to half the slate of movies is made up of camp, though she said that’s often not deliberate. “I programmed a singalong night for ‘Grease 2’ at one point,” Ms. Cacioppo said. “But that’s because I sincerely liked that movie.” Most of the films don’t have an overlay of commentary, but there’s an unspoken pact that audience members can, within reason, add their own gibes to the soundtrack.

Ms. Cacioppo began programming these movies because she saw a dearth of formalized events in New York for fans of trash cinema when the 92Y opened in 2008. Since then they have become more common. The Landmark Sunshine Cinema on the Lower East Side hosts a screening of the cult hit “The Room” on the first Saturday of every month (that means this weekend), while the IFC Center in Greenwich Village will occasionally smuggle a turkey like “Red Dawn” (the Patrick Swayze version) into its otherwise impeccable Waverley Midnights schedule. The Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn is also screening some duds this month, like the Indonesian action knockoff “Lady Terminator.” Both the Nitehawk and the 92Y have the added benefit of being licensed to serve alcohol.

Ms. Cacioppo said that her bad-movie nights quickly caught on with New Yorkers in their 20s and 30s, the type of cinephiles who grew up renting lousy VHS tapes and watching the cult cable show “Mystery Science Theater 3000.” At first Ms. Cacioppo would show bad movies on weeknights when the screening room had not been reserved. But since then events like her Swayze Days of Summer series (featuring the most dubious hits from the 1980s star) have tended to get a stronger turnout at the 92Y than more serious-minded fare, like foreign-language films or small indie dramas. Among the most anticipated events on the calendar are the periodic live riffing nights performed by the “Flop House” hosts. (The podcast itself is usually recorded, without an audience, in Mr. McCoy’s Brooklyn apartment.)

Ms. Cacioppo said their “Bratz” event sold out faster than an appearance by Peter Bogdanovich in the same space earlier last year. Their next show is Friday, when they will comment on the misguided Steve-Guttenberg-in-a-mullet romantic comedy “Don’t Tell Her It’s Me.”
