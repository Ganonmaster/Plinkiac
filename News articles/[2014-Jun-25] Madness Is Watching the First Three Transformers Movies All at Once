Watching any one of Michael Bay's Transformers films is enough to drive a person insane. In preparation for this weekend's fourth movie, the brave men of Red Letter Media watched the first three simultaneously. They are probably all dead now.

At least their assumed deaths were not in vain — we learn an awful lot about Michael Bay's process in the clips we're shown here. We knew he basically made the same movie three times, but we didn't know how closely each film followed the formula — in some cases it's down to the second.
