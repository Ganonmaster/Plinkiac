Been wondering when someone would come up with a new “rubber puppet monster” horror-comedy franchise along the lines of those classics from the 1980s, Critters and Gremlins? Well, this might be it.
What’s the monster in the box like? We don’t know, but the dry humour on display here bodes well for the film.
The director commented to the Backbrain: “It’s a feature length film. We have about 85% in the can and looking to finish the final scenes in March sometime.” So what’s it like? “Well, it’s more of a satirical comedy than a real creature kind of movie — a sort of homage to the rubber puppet monster films of the ’80s.”
Feeding Frenzy‘s tagline is “The shit just got real!” — which Avery has declared to be “the tagline of the year”. Maybe we’ll make a contest out of it. I’ll collect taglines during 2010 and readers of Undead Backbrain can vote in December….
