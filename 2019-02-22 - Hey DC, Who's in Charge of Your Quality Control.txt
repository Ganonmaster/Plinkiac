Mike: I can't wait to play with my new Aquaman toy, with built-in Aquaman phrases, like...
Aquaman: Do it for justice.
Mike: What?
Aquaman: Villians beware.
Mike: Okay.
Aquaman: I'm ready for action.
Mike: Sure
Aquaman: I am Batman.
Mike: Uh, what?
Aquaman: I am Batman.
Mike: Did he just say he was Batman?
Aquaman: I'm ready for action.
Mike: Okay, me too.
Aquaman: I am Batman.
Mike: What?
Aquaman: Stand up and fight.
Mike: I don't remember Aquaman saying, Stand up and fight.
Aquaman: Do it for justice.
Mike: Did they put the wrong chip in this action figure?
Aquaman: I am Batman.
Mike: I guess so...oh!
Aquaman: I am Batman.
