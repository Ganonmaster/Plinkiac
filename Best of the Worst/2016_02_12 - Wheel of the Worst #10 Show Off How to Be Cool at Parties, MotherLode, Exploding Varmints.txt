Rich: Man, I cannot wait for Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of AIDS. It’s gonna be so good. So good
[Mike slowly limps in] R: Oh! Hi Mike
Mike: Hi Rich
R: Where’ve you been? 
M: Oh, you know. I’ve been busy. Just taking care of all the Space Cop blu-rays
[Space Cop blu-rays are all outside in a dumpster]
R: [Stammers, talks slowly] So--it’s time for another Wheel of the Worst!
M: Oh boy, I can’t wait!
R: What kind of garbage do we have on this wheel today?
M: Will you improve your attitude?
R: Sorry
M: Our first film is called…..BabyVision. I think that’s one word 
R: You said that, BabyVision, which is kind of great 
M: There’s no space, it’s BabyVision. “Your baby or toddler’s own video!” Exclamation mark. Umm and there’s a picture of the Earth and the moon, uh, some hot air balloons, a carousel, and then a baby, who’s wearing a hat
R: Well, that looks like garbage
M: [Looks closer at the tape] “The more a child sees and hear, the more he wants to pee in his diaper. Five percent of the profits from the sale of BabyVision will be donated to the Guild for Infant Survival of SIDS.” How does an infant survive SIDS? It’s called Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. You don’t survive SIDS!
R: That’s--that’s very true
M: Anyway--
R: Is Jean Pickett(?)--that’s not the grief clown, is it?
M: No, that’s Eloise Cole
R: Oh yes, that’s right, the demon, Eloise Cole
M: [Snickers] All right, Rich, why don’t you talk about our next video?
R: Why, our next video is “HIV/AAAAIIIDDDSSSSS and Older Americans. A collaborative project between the office of AAAIIDDDSSS research, NIH, and the National Minority AIDS Council, September 2001.” September 2001?! Everything about this video is a disaster!
M: Oh my lord, a lot of bad things happened in September 2001. Uh--well now the title is “HIV/AIDS and Older Americans.” Now, it doesn’t say HIV/AIDS...you know, older Americans with HIV/AIDS. So is the first half of the video about HIV/AIDS and the second half is just some older Americans, just doing some things
R: I think it’s about, like, like, 85-year old men and women who are taking care of like, dying AIDS patients
M: Ok, so HIV/AIDS and older Americans
R: [In an old person voice] “We brought you some soup”
M: Chicken soup?
R: “Chicken soup will cure everything, except AAIIIDDSSSS” [Mike and Rich sort of laugh]
M: So HIV/AIDS and elderly Americans is a video about Charlie Sheen? [Rich cackles, Mike turns red] Laughing at others’ medical misfortunes, hilarious
R: I’m just picturing the maker of this video, like, waking up on the morning of September 11 all excited about the release of his new AIDS video
M: And finally help the elderly who have AIDS cope with--OH NO
R: Speaking of AIDS [Turns the wheel]
M: Oh my god, it’s Leo DiCaprio. Our next video is Hangin’ with Leo. Look, there are little hearts on the exclamation marks. “Attention Leo fans: this is the real Leo. Parties, fun, girls! [Points to Rich] You gotta have it!”
R: Well, that’s so unexciting. That’s almost as unexciting as…[Turns the wheel] MotherLode. “Amazing! Incredible! Mind-boggling! Beautiful Morel mushrooms--and lots of them! With America’s number one Morel expert, Larry ‘Tree’ Lonik”. I can’t wait to learn about those mushrooms.
M: Our next video is called The Singles’ Guide to…………..oh, Los Angeles. The singles’ guide--
R: Sunglasses?
M: Sunglasses and faded cover. You can tell this videotape was stored on a shelf that was in direct sunlight somewhere. “Featuring Eva La Rue, Martina Castle, Robin Lynn, and world renowned gourmet Paul Wallack.”
R: Well, that just sounds amazing, Mike. “Show off! How to be cool at parties! Stunts, tricks, and--”gays?
M: Gays to amaze your friends 
R: And gays to amaze your friends. Starring Malcolm-Jamal Warner. Forgotten star of The Cosby Show
M: “Stunts, tricks, and gags to amaze your friends”
R: Gags!
M: Really kind of a weird font
R: That makes much more sense
M: Starring Malcolm-Jamal Warner of The Cosby Show
R: Well, speaking of Bill Cosby, our next tape is….[Skips Exploding Varmints] How to Seduce Women Who Aren’t Aware of What’s Going On
[Pause] M: By Bill Cosby
R: By Bill Cosby
M: Um, wow, How to Seduce Women Through Hypnosis 
R: “Seduce”
M: Yeaaahh, I doubt this tape would fly in 2016
R: At the point where you’re willing to hypnotize a woman, why not just use the roofie? [Dog barks] I--you know? [Mike doesn’t say anything, Rich turns the wheel back] Exploding Varmints!
M: The crown jewel of our wheel, now--and this is a rare occasion, where I actually have the back of the box printed out, ‘cause normally we can’t--we can’t get them off 
R: They’re on there with cement
M: They’re on there pretty good
[Rich removes the Exploding Varmints tape, it falls on the floor] R: Oh no
M: “If you are a hunter who likes a lot of action--” Bill Cosby--” then you’ll want to see Exploding Varmints. From your favorite (???) experience the excitement of exploding so many varmints. Your shoulder will ache.”
R: Your shoulder?
M: I guess you’ll furiously masturbate. I really don’t know. Uh, “and see why they-- why we call this video Exploding Varmints. Enjoy film footage of varmint-hunting, like you’ve never seen before. And witness over 500 confirmed exploding kills, in this action-packed video. Share the thrill of the hunt, with us, your family, friends, and clergy.”
R: And clergy? You have to be making that last part up
M: No! No! “After viewing this video, you, your buddies, and your clergy will be praying for more.”
R: Unlike Bill Cosby’s victims

[8:33] R: I wanted AIDS
MJW: Psst! Hey, you!
[Rich points at himself and looks around as if to say “me??”] 

[9:32] Man: Now, if you get down here and you still have a ways to go, you can fake the rest of it with your upper body and your head like this
Jay: Or just kill yourself
Jack: Oh hoho!
M: This guy didn’t kill himself. He was a failed prop comedian from the early 90s. Ironically, he fell down the stairs

[10:00] [A woman pretends to be dragged behind a door by an invisible dog]
[Camera zooms in on Jack making a weird face]
Man: Now how it is you do that?
Woman: The secret, to this one now, is to pretend that you have a dog
[Everyone laughs] M: No shit!

[11:22] [A lively Irish(?) jig plays, Rich takes off his cap and scratches his head, Mike blankly stares at the tv]

[12:06] R: [Sticks out his arms, makes a squeezing gesture] Bob, I found your mushroom
M: Eww

[12:33] J: This is like pervert camp. Pick those mushrooms
R: The squirrel’s (???) name

[12:45] R: Well, Jack, the last couple of videos, those were duds, let’s hope we do better with this last bit [Camera zooms out, Exploding Varmints is the only tape on the wheel] 
JK: Oh yeah, yeah, can’t wait to see what we get
R: Here we go, here we go, I’m praying for Exploding Varmints
JK: I’m hoping we get more Malcolm-Jamal Warner 
R: Well, maybe, maybe, we’ll see what the wheel decides

[13:46] J: I don’t regret this(???)

[15:59] [At the table] M: You know what also has 0 calories, this beer
J: Oh yeah
JK: I don’t think that’s true
M: They say they’re empty calories, which is good for you
JK: Oh, I guess--
J: If they’re empty, it’s like--
JK: It’s like 0 calories--
J: Exactly, it’s the same thing
M: They can’t--they can’t--they can’t make you any fatter
JK: Drinking beer is like losing weight
M: I know
R: I thought you were just drinking water from Lake Michigan

[16:46] M: The MotherLode and Exploding Varmints are living proof that any psychopath can run a video camera

[17:47] R: That’s dumb. That’s so dumb

[18:38] R: I think there was a class-action lawsuit from all the 6-year olds who get beat up after trying these stunts

[18:56] R: [Gets up] I wanna show you something. I wanna show you something I learned in the video. (...) Oh, oh, I left my mic in the basement, hold on. [Rich pretends to go down stairs, yelling after every step, as if in excruciating pain, Jack cringes]
M: You’re walking down stairs barefoot on broken glass? Is that what he’s doing?
J: No, I think it’s just--Rich Evans walking down the stairs

[19:38] [Rich sits back down] M: That was really good, Rich [Everybody claps]

[21:08] JK: Maybe they’re using “party” as just, like, “hangout”? Maybe every time you hang out with people is a party IF you do those tricks. Maybe you’ve gone to really boring parties. Did you ever pretend to slam your--the door in your face?
M: The weird thing is, I’ve been to a lot of children’s birthday parties, and the weird thing is, I still go to them. And--it’s usually, like, I’m not invited, and they’re strangers, which is all, all around kind of weird, but you know--
J: It seems like that’s a situation where this video would be most helpful, because that’s who’s gonna be impressed by these things, is an adult doing it in front of small children
JK: I mean, how else are you gonna get the kids to come near you, yeah?
J: The best trick in here, I don’t know if you’ve done it, but the best trick in this video, if you’re going to small children's birthday parties is the one where you press your face on the glass and just stare creepy
M: I do that on their bedroom windows
J: Yeah, yeah [Tries not to laugh]
R: I don’t know, I like--kinda like--
M: Sometimes I play hide and seek with little kids, but for me, it’s just “hide.” Usually they get in a shallow grave. And it’s somewhere in the woods

[22:17] M: Are those air quotes or are you having a stroke?

[22:55] J: That’s what he’s most known for, these days, still, is his sweaters that he would wear on The Cosby Show 
R: Taught him--how to--how to eat a jello pudding pop
M: Yeah
R: You stick a roofie in it

[23:10] [Trigger warning: RACISM appears on screen with a still of Han Solo in the background] 
[There’s a guy in a Middle Eastern outfit sitting on a magic carpet chanting Ohm] M: Oh my god, racist, oh my god, racist
R: Mike, are you stereotype-shaming?

[24:51] R: “Warning: parental supervision is NOT permitted” 

[25:06] J: I hate this video
M: It--it--it makes you wanna take a shower
J: This is the--this is bottom of the barrel, as far as we--
M: It’s not even about rape. You know what I mean? It’s just...
JK: First of all, no, I don’t know what you mean
J: Yeah. Do you think the How to Trick Women Into Sleeping With You Through Hypnosis video is more or less sleazy than this?
M: Oh! Wait, that wasn’t what we watched? [Silence] That whole bit about the pencil? 

[26:12] M: Now, Jack, tell us about this alleged video

[28:59] M: Yeah, he’s like, this boring guy, and I guess, I looked him up online, thank god he’s dead [Rich and Jack laugh]
JK: No, that’s not something you say about someone
M: Well, it’s just, I don’t care, I don’t want this man around, and the man made this video and I had to watch it
J: Yeah. I think that’s justified, sure
M: Ok, I don’t know what happened…
R: I want Jimmy Fallon to be dead, that doesn’t make me a bad person
J: I think everyone would agree with that
M: Jimmy Fallon…
J: Oh, now you gotta do your Jimmy Fall On joke
M: Jimmy Fallon drinks so much booze his name is Jimmy Fall on the ground [Rimshot] When he first got his job as the host of whatever, Tonight Show, I said, “Jimmy Fallon? The only thing he should host is a parasite”

[31:25] J: Jesus, this looks dangerous
M: This looks like a fucking ISIS video

[31:33] R: I’m not even kidding, I think Larry might be somewhere on the autistic spectrum. This is--this is not a man--
M: Can’t say that
R: What? Why not?
M: You said that before and everyone freaked out
R: I don’t give a shit, he’s autistic [**#autism-shaming**] People with--people freak out--I don’t know, grow a fucking backbone [**#scoliosis-shaming**] Learn to take a comment that you don’t like and not freak out. Get laid [**#infrequent-intercourse-shaming**] I’m Rich Evans, I’ve gotten laid, you can do it
M: Eww

[33:20] R: “I’m writing you a prescription for a rope”

[33:50] M: I thought that was the site where I found his obituary. Oh, oh, it’s mushroomfucker.net

[34:15] [Mike reads about Larry’s death, camera closes in on Rich staring blankly at the ground]

[34:23] M: He loved mushrooms so much, he wanted to, like, intermix with their spores and create more mushrooms
R: Sorry, I--I didn’t hear any of that, I got lost in thought, I was thinking I was just beating somebody’s head in, with like, the back end of a rifle

[35:44] M: It’s weird, that like--subcultures...especially very, very specific ones--[Jay taps the Exploding Varmints tape]--people that love a specific type of mushroom, or people who love exploding varmints. It’s--we have two videos about very, very niche…
JK: Very niche
M:...ssssomethings
JK: And we are a niche subculture of people who enjoy bad video cassettes talking about even more niche subcultures, it’s--it’s--it’s a cycle
R: So our fans are interested in both AIDS and 9/11 
J: What?
R: And Star Wars [Everyone laughs] Star Wars, AIDS, and 9/11
JK: The Big 3
R: The Big 3

[37:40] J: Much like the Italian film “Pieces”, it’s exactly what you think it is [Mike makes a confused sort of face] Uh, this is the home movie footage--
JK: He’s gotta bring arty farty bullshit--
J: That’s not arty farty, it’s like a shitty Italian horror film about people getting cut into pieces, and the movie’s called “Pieces”, and the tagline on the poster is: “it’s exactly what you think it is”

[38:45] JK: I just--I just can’t believe this is the video [Jay laughs]
R: Truth in advertising

[47:38] JK: [Crying/laughing] Why would anyone do this?

[48:22] R: This [Show Off] is cynical and horrible. This [MotherLode] is somebody doing something he loves. This [Exploding Varmints] is something somebody does because they love, in a cynical and horrible way, so, just by virtue of math, Exploding Varmints wins
