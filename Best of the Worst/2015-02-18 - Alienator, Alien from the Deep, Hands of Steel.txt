Jack: What are you drinking?
Mike: Well, I was going to drink this Tom Green beer, but it’s all washed up [Looks at the camera]
Jack: Ohh...ho-ho-ho-ho! What are we watching today, Mike?
Mike: Uh, today, Jack, we’re going to watch, let’s see, we have[Points to the corresponding shelves] horror, sci-fi, or action
Jack: Ooh
Mike: I’ll let you pick, Jack
Jack: [Mike keeps turning and shuffling around] I think we, I, I think...we, I think we should, I was thinking that we could go for some sci-fi!
Mike: Alright! Let’s move the skull [Puts the skull on another shelf] Now let’s just take the first three [Grabs the first three VHS tapes] 
Jack: Perfect
Mike: Right off the shelf
Jack: Easy peasy
Mike: What’s up first, Jack?
Jack: Is...Alienator!
Jack: An android hunter from outer space is about to create hell on Earth 
Mike: [Looks up, rolls his eyes] [Mouths] Android hunter from outer space...
Jack: Alienator from deep space, the deadliest animal...is still women
Mike: What?
Jack: Woman
Mike: Oh!
Jack: Is still woman. In deep space, the deadliest animal is still woman
Mike: Okay, so it i-, w-, it is confirmed that it’s a, it’s a woman [Shows the person on the cover]
Jack: This is a woman
Mike: Okay
Jack: Whoa, wrestler.
Jay: That, that has to be a wrestler. Oh, no. Did I miss excitement?
Rich: Not really
Jack: It’s a futuristic fight to the finish when the commander of a space station prison takes on galactic archvillain Kol
Mike: Mike: This is based on a true story?
Jack: Yah, you know, with like, android hunter from outer space, the arm thing, I think this might have taken a cue from the Metroid video game series
Mike: Ohhh ok
Jack: You’re a hunter and you got a little arm gun [Goes back to reading] Uh, when Kol escapes on the verge of his execution, the commander has no choice but to unleash...the Alienator! Kol’s shuttle crash lands on Earth, and the injured alien is befriended by Armstrong
Mike: What’s Kol’s last name? Is is Slaw? [Takes a sip from his mug] [Jack laughs silently]
Jack: Ohhhhh [Camera points towards the broken bottle on the ground] 

[2:54] [In the screening room]
Mike: That sounded a little shook 
Jack: This very secure prison
Rich: The most secure prison!
Jay: Is this just like a garage somewhere 
Jack: It is. They filmed this in a storage unit 
Jay: Yeah
Mike: That, that’s the...
Jay: You can see the light on the wall. That’s amazing. I love it
[In the VHS room]
Jack: Uh, Sargent Kol Lonoscopy, ehh lands on Earth
Mike: Did you just, you pulled that out of your ass, didn’t you?
Jack: That was a great joke, Mike! That was really good. But the Alienator is hot on his trail. She’s determined to capture her prey even if it means blowing away everything and everyone that gets in her way
Mike: What escapes? Something from a space prison?
Jack: Kol
Mike: Kol is the guy who escaped from a space prison. Ok
Jack: Kol. So Kol starts off as the bad guy, the Alienator’s the good guy capturing the bad guy, but then she goes crazy on Earth
Mike: Alright, well, sounds like a little bit Terminator, and a little bit, uh, uh, Critters? I think they’re Critters, yeah. And a little bit, uh, Gene Simmons

[4:08] Mike: Is this an outtake?

[4:12] Jack: [Holds up his arms] What’s next, Mike?
Mike: Well, let’s see. It’s a DVD
Jack: Ooh
Mike: Uh, Alien from the Deep
Jack: Hmm
Mike: Wow. Uh, looks like Predator?....With a lobster claw. This, this, uh, oh god, there’s a ton of words on the back
Jack: I know reading isn’t your strong suit
Mike: Mike: Uh, somewhere deep in the jungle a chemical corporation dumps tons of toxic waste in a still active volcano. Well this is off to a great start! [Rich laughs in the background]
[5:16] Mike: Two environmentalists try to expose these illegal ways of getting rid of hugely dangerous waste. But they get caught by vigilantes working for the company
Jack: Ooh
Mike: Wow okay. How does it, wha-, a volcano has nothing to do with the deep. This is an underwater volcano? That’d be a lot of effort to dump toxic waste in an underwater volcano
Jack: The toxic goo starts at the magma, then it goes all the way down
Mike: To come to think of it, inside a volcano, like an active volcano is a great way to get rid of toxic waste
Jack: Probably not

[6:20] [Everyone yells Yaayyy! when a boat explodes]

[6:23] Mike: The super-hot Maria ‘Guila Cavelli’ manages to escape, and she is savaged by a snake farmer. Who lives alone in the jungle
Jack: S-, so one of the hippies, who tried to protect the volcano gets raped by a snake farmer
Mike: Yes
Jack: It’s great, it’s great
Mike: Oh! I’m sorry, I, ahh, completely different, uh, connotation here, I, I...did I say savaged?
Jack: You said savaged
Mike: Okay, saved [Jack laughs] So I was wondering why they would work together to bring down the company after she was savaged by him, but, I, I misread saved
Jack: That, yeah, very...
Mike: So, yeah, okay, so she’s saved by a snake farmer
Jack: Great
Mike: Together they try to bring down the company but it’s too late. Years of chemical poisoning have spawned a deadly monster. That has set out to exact revenge on the humans that have unknowingly brought him to life, now[Points to the monster on the cover] I don’t know how radiation creates that, but I think that’s what they’re saying...would you want to bet that this thing, [Points to the monster], does not appear in the film at all? That this is just some stupid cover, much, much like ROTOR?
Jack: This robot creature appears...
Mike: Yeah, it’s just gonna be a guy in like, a rubber suit that looks terrible
Jack: I mean I would kind of love that, no, that does not appear in the movie’s would be my guess
Mike: Yeah, I’m gonna, I’m gonna guess that as well
Jack: Because, like I get the, the lobster thing, right? ‘Cause it’s like radiation goes into the ocean and makes mutant lobsters, but why is it a robot lobster?

[8:13] Mike: Alien from the Deep is one of the most beloved Italian rip-offs. A wildly entertaining ride, the movie is an inventive crossover where lots of different genres and styles are mixed
Jack: A rip-off of what?
Mike: I don’t know Loads of gore and action, plenty of bloody shootouts. A hugely entertaining monster, the infamous, quote, ‘Big Claw.’ So
Jack: There’s at least a claw
Mike: Yeah. And some very titillating moments courtesy of stunning Miss Cavalli. What more could you ask for?
Man: All you need now is...
Woman: Don’t touch me, you snake squeezer
[Rich and Jay suddenly burst into laughter, Mike laughs]
[In the VHS room]
Mike: What’s next?
Jack: Next on our list is Hands...of Steel
Jack: You know what’s weird, is like all the movies have a, like, a thing on their arm
Mike: That’s right
Jack: And I know we kind of chose these just at random, just like the first three...
Mike: They were the first three on the shelf
Jack: And...but they all have things on their arms, so this is the sci-fi things on your arm Best of the Worst
Mike: It’s a good thing we didn’t pick four movies, ‘cause the scariest movie is next, May West in Sextette [Silence] Just as frightening as the lobster monster, what’s Hands of Steel all about?
Jack: Feel the grip..of Futureworld action 
Mike: Okay, I’m feeling it
Jack: Yep. Falcon Crest’s Daniel Greene stars in the sci-fi stunner set in the bleak Futureworld...of 1997
Mike: Oh-ho that was a pretty bleak Futureworld
Rich: [Reads the mural in the background] You have no future [Jay, Rich, and Jack laugh]
Mike: Inspiring message from our dictator
Jay: I appreci-, I appreciate his honesty. You know it’s the future ‘cause of tube
Mike: Oh my god [Jack and Jay laugh]
Jack: You know...
Rich: It’s just like Space Cop
Jack: Silver dryer exhaust tubing 
Jay: That, that’s worse than anything in Space Cop [Pause, Mike chuckles] This is like an apartment!
Jack: Yeah
Jay: What is happening
Jack: The Earth is bleached and battered by toxic gases and acid rain. The human race teeters on the verge of extinction! Only one lone scientist to give mankind hope [Silence] Paco Querek (Greene) is a superstrong half-man, half-machine cyborg, hired to terminate the scientist. He must outsmart and outbattle him in a true test of brawn. Uh, John Saxton, (A Nightmare on Elm Street) co-stars as the ruthless programmer determined to finish the mission. His goal could mean utter disaster. When metal meshes with man, when the planet reels with ecological horror, the fate of the world may rest in
Mike: Hands of Steel?
Jack: Hands of Steel! Nice one, Mike
Mike: That’s, that’s, that’s a very well-written synopsis on the back
Jack: Yeah, I felt pretty good about that
Mike: Yeah
Jack: I think, like, if you, if you look at the back here, the guy on the back...has no, like, hint of cyborgyness
Mike: Yeah
Jack: And sothe question then remains is will we ever see [Taps the guy on the cover]
Mike: My guess is that it’s internal cyborgness
Jack: Sure
Mike: And, and he’s sort of like Terminator. And this is probably a rip-off of that, does it say the year? Um, and we never see that, ever, ‘cause that looks like someone’s artwork
Jack: Yeah
Mike: That is not in the movie at all
Jack: 1986
Mike: Okay. That’s exactly perfect
Jack: Yeah, so you don’t think we’re gonna, are we gonna see any robotness besides like, robovision, obviously we’ll see robovision
Mike: We’ll we robovision, hmm, they might do some bad makeup effects where his skin’s ripped and we see a little piece of metal, but we’re not gonna see that gauntlet on his arm, with all these mechanisms, ‘cause that’s just some BS on the cover, same with the lobster man
Jack: Yeah
Mike: The lobster man’s gonna be a shitty rubber suit
Jack: Yeah
Mike: And it’s not gonna look as awesome as that
Jack: That’s true
Mike: And then, what was our first movie? I don’t even remember, Alienator?
Jack: Aliena-tor, that’s with the lady with the gun arm
Mike: Okay. That looks like crap so that’ll probably in the movie
Jack: You think the gun arm’s in the movie?
Mike: Yeah. Yeah, it’ll look like crap, all this is crap
Jay: And Alienator...uh, starts, there’s a pre-credits sequence, which, I think, if the movie ended after that pre-credits sequence it would probably be the best movie we’ve watched on Best of the Worst. So, that opening credits sequence, we’re introduced to Jan-Michael Vincent, who apparently had a drinking problem, right, Rich? [Cuts to Jay and Mike drinking while Rich goes on to talk more about Jan-Michael Vincent]
Jay: That guy, he sounds really angry to be in this movie
Mike: He sounds liquored up
Jay: Yeah
[At the table]
[Rich and Jack laugh]
Rich: Have you, have you, have you seen a picture of this man lately? 
Mike: Oh, he’s still alive...
Rich: He’s ready for the tombstone. Oh, he, he looks like Hell warmed over [Jay huffs out air] He looks like, he looks like the homeless man...
Mike: Is that an old man expression? Like hell warmed over? [Jay laughs] Where did you, did you just make up that expression?
Rich: No!
Mike: Grandpa, have you taken your medicine today?
Rich: Yeah!
Mike: Grandpa...
Rich: Rich: Yeah!
Mike: That was awfully risky
Jay: I feel like we say for some reason a lot on Best of the Worst
Rich: Because it’s an accurate description [Jay laughs] These movies don’t explain things well
Mike: What I would’ve enjoyed is, if she, her little computer thing said non-threatening to the deer, and then when she was petting the deer, just, r'auughhh!
Jay: Wow, we’ve learned a lot from Alienator
Jack: It’s really great
Jay: Yeah
Jack: I feel good about...
Mike: And I wanna know where Jan-Michael Vincent gets his hairspray [Jay chuckles]
Jack: Army surplus store?
Mike: Yeah.(?) Home Depot?
Rich: That’s rubber cement
Mike: Yeah, exactly, it’s like...
Jack: Beautiful
Mike: It’s in case he gets hit in the head with a hammer. From a, from an assassin, you know.someone sneaks up on him, and the hammer head breaks off
Jay: Yeah
Rich: It’s a stealth helmet (?)
Mike: You hit my hair [Silence] Uh...so, Jay! Would you recommend Alienator? [Jack shakes his head]
Jay: The, we’re not on Half in the Bag, that’s not how this works...
Mike: Oh shit!
Jack: That’s not how this show works
Mike: They’re, they’re giant, like, stonewashed mom jeans
Jay: Yeah
Mike: Basically
Jack: They’re beyond mom jeans, they’re like single lesbian grandma jeans
J: ...the movie’s not about...her butt
Jack: No
Rich: It kind of is
Jay: I’m convinced that the whole, his whole motivation for this, is that he just wants to impress her, with his camcorder
Rich: He’s clearly in the friendzone
Mike: Yeah
Rich: Yeah
Mike: And then she doesn’t even care when he throws himself off a cliff, because he’s infected with toxic goo
Jack: He, he sacrificed himself to save her, and she’s like fuck that guy. This new guy has fashionable stubble
Rich: But as, apparently, as opposed to just having a giant evil claw, it’s also covered in, like, mutagen acid
Jack: Yes
Rich: Because it melts friendzone guy’s arm, and then it melts snake man’s shotgun
Jay: Hmm
Rich: Like it just melts the shotgun! Which is when he thinks to just start throwing bullets at it
Jay: The worst part about getting infected by this mutagen is that, uh, when you’re in the midst of death, you turn into a dummy
Rich: Ohhh [Rich and Jay laugh] The head came off!
Jay: Oh yeah, we didn’t mention that! The scientist in this movie is the old man from YoRich: Hunter from the Future
Mike: Grandpa #2
Jay: Grandpa #2, all these movies have grandpas
Rich: Th-, there’s a theme of grandpas of diminishing effectiveness
Jay: Yes
Rich: Throughout these movies [Rich and Jack laugh]
Jay: That’s true
Jack: These movies have several interconnecting pieces and one of them is grandpas
Mike: No, no theme between all three other than bad

[35:49] Mike: Shit has hit the fan. And, uh, she gets splashed with goo, and that’s like you have goo on your shirt, you know, you better get into...
Rich: You better take a shower
Mike: You better get into the wet t-shirt machine [Everybody laughs] And then it becomes...it’s despicable
Rich: There was an Italian man saying [In an Italian accent] I want to see boobies! [Jack laughs] Come on, take off your shirt!
Jack: So the incredibly important tape, the hippie gives it up...with, you know, so, poof, all that plot is gone
Jay: Yep
Mike: He throws it into the volcano
Jack: He throws it into the volcano, right
Jay: And you realize all this was pointless
Jack: But there are still witnesses
M: Yeah, sure.
Rich: Hmm-hmm
Jack: But he lets them go...for some reason [Rich laughs] This, this is a man who has killed his own men for doing nothing worse than falling in a hole [Everybody laughs]
[The man hits a soldier in the face with the end of a rifle]
[In the screening room]
Jack: You dick!!
[A soldier falls into a hole]
Rich: Why do they have all these holes around here?!
Jay: Pfff!
SoldieRich: God damn you, Colonel!!!
Rich: [Laughs] His final words are great
Jay: What’d he say?
Rich: God damn you, Colonel!!

[37:04] Rich: Well, this is, see, this is the sliding scale of grandpa effectiveness, right? 
Jay: Yeah
Rich: [Points to Alienator] Colonel Grandpa saves the day.
Jay: Hmm-mmm
Rich: [Points to Alien from the Deep] Then Colonel Grandpa runs out with his hydrogen f-...
Jay: Not Colonel Grandpa, Grandpa Yor!           Mike: Scientist Grandpa!
Rich: Okay, okay...
[Cuts to another take]
Rich: [Points at Alienator] Colonel Scientist saves the day...
Mike: Colonel Grandpa
[Silence, Rich looks between Mike and the tape]
[Everybody tries to explain at the same time]
Rich: Scien-, oh god [Points at Alienator] Colonel Grandpa saves the day with good old American machine guns that were made in Russia.and then Grandpa Yor runs in to save the day with a hydrogen flame thrower, falls down and dies

[39:20] [An explosion goes off behind the protagonists as they run away]
Rich: They died of cancer three years later

[40:11] Jack: [Picks up the last tape] Hands of Steel! The third of our sci-fi movies with a thing on their arm
Jay: Yes
Jack: Not so much sci-fi-ey, little more action-schlocky[Singsong] Miiiiike! You get the honor
Mike: Well, from the fine folks at Lightning Video[Everyone chuckles] comesHands of Steel, starring Tim Tebow...as Man.and
Jay: Action Man
Mike: As Action Man...
Jay: Robot Action Man

[42:08] Rich: [With overlapping dialogue] Did he kick him in the nuts really hard?
Jack: Ha ha, what?
Woman: Yes, we realize that, but we were hoping that you might recall some sensation before you lost consciousness. Even a vague impression might be helpful
Jay: I felt the sensation of getting punched in the balls [Jack and Rich chuckle]
Grandpa: It wasn’t especially large, but it felt hard.[Mike and Rich laugh]
Jack: He, he, he fucked his spleen 

[42:50] [In the screening room]
Mike: The computer figured it out [Rich and Jay laugh]
Jay: Ughh
[At the table]
Jack: [To Mike] Can I just say that you are horrible at synopsises
Mike: Well, [Jay laughs] (?)

[43:01] [There’s several shots of homeless people]
Jay: Oh, this is depressing
Jack: These are actual homeless...
Jay: Yeah, you could tell it’s just, um.guerilla style (?) shots
Rich: I think that footage of homeless men, they gave Jan-Michael Vincent a camera and they told him to film his friends

[46:02] Jack: In the mid 80s they started hiring stuntmen as their lead actors
Jay: Yes
Mike: Or martial arts guys
Rich: Errol Flynn did his own stunts
Jack: No one gets your old man references
Rich: That man can swordfight, goddammit! [Jay laughs, then Rich]
Mike: [Sticks a thumb out at Rich] Well there’s our fourth grandpa right here [Jay and Rich laugh loudly]
Rich: I know this because I’ve seen The Rocketeer, which also makes me an old man
Jay: Yeah, yeah
Jack: It’s true, both of these things are true
Mike: The Rocke-who? [Rich and Jay laugh]
Rich: I get it, I get it
Jay: That was a reference to the movie

[46:56] Mike: These guys...these Tim Tebow characters, or whoever this guy’s name is, Paco, whatever his real name is, I don’t know. S-, Greene something? These guys are a dime a dozen, and this guy’s...
Jay: You can find buff guys
Mike: Yeah [Rich giggles]
Jay: In L.A. you can find buff guys [Silence, Mike and Rich make somewhat confused expressions] (?)
Jack: How, how do you know that?
[Mike looks at Rich]
Rich: I’m not sayin’ anything [Jay and Rich laugh]
Jack: Jay, you seem to know a lot about buff guys in L.A.
Jay: Listen...
Rich: And Jack takes the obvious joke
Jack: One of us had to! I take no shame in that 
Mike: [Bangs a bottle opener on the table] So! Where can we find these buff guys in L.A.? [Rich guffaws]
Jay: Oh, let me tell ya. There’s several, several underpasses
Jack: [Claps] That was a good one
Jay: I don’t know
Jack: I liked that
Jay: I don’t know
Mike: It’s a little bar called the Manhole
Jay: We need to talk about...after Raul loses the, uh, uh, uh, arm wrestling match, he devises a plan to get even with Cyborg Man, which, uh, relies on lots and lots of coincidences that he could not anticipate [Rich laughs]
Mike: And allows those backstabbing Native Americans to break their promise
Jay: Yeah, yeah, there’s this Native American couple that calls to the diner
Mike: They want to get back for all those smallpox blankets that Jay gave them. Oh, not you, your ancestors
Jay: My ancestors. Okay. I do have some Native American in me, actually
Mike: That’s only when you’re at the Manhole
Rich: Look, the device’s only purpose is to determine gender. That’s all it does
Jack: How many men and women are in this building?
Rich: It’s the Tranny Tracker 5000
Mike: Yeah!
Jay: Yeah, use your fists of steel!
Jack: Rip his head off!! Rip his fucking head off!!
Jay: He’s not going to
Mike: That would be so awesome if he did
Jay: Is he just crushing his head? Awww...
Mike: Alien from the Deep, also, it had a giant lifeless puppet, and this one also had a giant, lifeless puppet...it was our main actor
Jack: So now is the time...
Jay: Yes
Jack: We need to figure out which is the best of the worst
Rich: Hands of Steel
Mike: Really? No, the best of the worst
Jack: But, now we get to the important part of the show, which is...do we feel like any of these...
Rich: Hands of Steel
