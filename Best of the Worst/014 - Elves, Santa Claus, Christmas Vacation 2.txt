[Rich opens the door to the dvd room(?) and walks in, he’s wearing pajamas and a robe, lighthearted Christmas-themed music plays]
Rich: Hey, everybody! Merry Christmas! 
[Record scratch]
[Camera pans over to show Jay reading the back of a DVD by a Christmas tree]
Jay: [Looks up] Why are you in pajamas?
R: Uh--I thought we were doing like a--a Christmas morning thing? Where you wake up, you run out to the tree and you open presents…?
[Pause]
J: No
[Rich looks past the camera, camera pans around again to show Jessi and Jack playing cards, they look up, Jessi shakes her head]
R: [Depressed] Ho...ho...ho no…
J: Well, Rich, uh, it looks like Santa left us some presents, and since you’re the festive one, why don’t ya open up a gift and see what he gave us?
R: Ok! [He groans in agony as he bends down, picks up a present and gets back up, his body makes creaking noises] Okay…“To: you idiots”
J: Oh…
R: “From...Satan”
J: Oh!
R: “Santa!”
J: Oh!
R: “Santa” [Unwraps the present] It’s….Elves! “They’re not working for Santa anymore.” Ok, so demon elves
J: Demon elves on Christmas?
R: Demon elves on Christmas, ok
J: Alright
R: A holiday horror
J: I’m sure it is

[1:51] Woman: We now convene the sisters of Anti-Christmas [Everyone bursts into laughter]
J: I wanna join *that* organization!
M: They look so anti-Christmas
J: Yeah…

[2:05] [Rich has a bow on his head]
R: What do we got here? Oh, they look--they look great!
J: What, the elves?
R: Yeah, yeah, these little puppet monsters [Jay laughs] Fantastic
(...)
R: “Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the town, blood-thirsty elves are about to get down!”
[Jay scrunches his nose]
R: Ok
J: Oh…
[Rich chuckles]
J: We’re off to a good start
R: No. Uh, “an innocent romp in the woods turns into a hellish nightmare when three young girls accidentally awaken an army of evil ‘elves,’” in quotes, “genetically created by a Neo-Nazi mad scientist during World War II” and we have a winner!
J: So we have Nazi elves on Christmas
R: [Chuckling] Nazi elves on Christmas. “These hideous creatures don’t work for Santa, they have a special mission: [Starts laughing] to mate with a virgin and take over the world as a pint-sized master race!” [They laugh]
J: Alright
R: Ohhhhh god
J: This has everything going for it
R: Yeah, yeah

[3:30] Jack: This is here henceforth called “Everything: The Movie”

[3:37] R: “Dan--Dan Haggerty (‘Grizzly Adams’) stars as Mike McGavin, a department store Santa who must expose the unholy force and stop the gruesome terror before the elves destroy Christmas”
J: Aww
R: Ok, when I first opened this box, I’m like [Disappointed] “oh,” but after I read the back of it, I’m like “oh!” So this--this started to look a lot better

[4:08] Jessi: “Here lies the last Santa”

[4:11] J: So we got Christmas horror movie, we got, uh, demon elves, we got Grizzly Adams…
R: Mall Santas and Nazis
J: Yes, yes, this sounds like a winner

[4:33] Mike: “Did someone say ‘dicks’?”

[4:38] J: It’s a Christmas miracle! [They put their hands up, Rich almost drops the tape]
R: Oh, oh!
J: Oh my god
[Rich juggles the tape, Jay grabs it, it magically slips from his hand and falls on the floor]
J: Oh god!
R: Oh no! I’ll get it, I’ll get it [He bends down while screaming in agony, picks up the tape, gets back up] Ok. Here you go [Jay grabs the tape but it falls again]
J: Oh no!
R: Oh no! [Bends down again]

[5:10] Girl: You pervert!
Little boy: I’m not a pervert, I like seeing naked girls
Girl: I’m your fucking sister!
Little boy: Yeah, and you’ve got fucking big tits and I’m gonna tell everybody I saw ‘em
[Jay laughs]
JS: Holy...moley
M: “Now here’s the line we want your son to say, mom” (?)

[5:31] JK: Haha, wasn’t Elves great? Nothing puts me in a holiday spirit like incest, rape, and Nazis. R-r-r-r-right, Mike?
M: Uh...why don’t we pick another film that Santa has left under the tree for us?
JK: Great, great, how about…[Picks up a present] oh, here’s one--“To Best of the Worst, From Santa” [Passes Mike the present] Why don’t you open that up, Mike?
M: Alright. Well, thank you, Santa
JK: I can’t wait to s--this is the first time we’ve opened a present and I can’t wait to see what it is
M: Yeah. I hope Santa didn’t leave us another shitty movie under the tree, I have a feeling he might have, though [Unwraps the present] What is it? Oh my god. It’s a DVD with 3 movies on it, what do we do?
JK: Uh, I think we just watch the first one on it, “Santa Claus”
(...)
M: This is where all the missing children end up
(...)
M: Well let’s take a look. Ooh, and this one has the shortest synopsis. “Santa Claus. Pitch, the mean-spirited devil is trying to ruin Christmas. Santa Claus teams up with Merlin the Magician and the children of the world.” Oh my god, that’s a pretty big team-up. “To--in order to save the day”
(...)
M: [As Santa] “ I can’t understand you. Do you work for me?”
R: [As the kid] “Santa, for Christmas I wanna go home”
(...)
M: Oh my god, it’s 94 minutes long
JK: Great! [Walks off]
M:.....Let’s go! Oh, he’s not there

[8:07] [Jack is standing close to Rich, talks in his ear]
JK: Hey, Rich
R: Yeah
JK: [Mumbles] You wanna watch some more Christmas movies?
R: No, I don’t wanna watch any more Christmas movies
JK: [Mumbles] Are we gonna have some Christmas movie fun?
R: No, no, please no
JK: Ok [Steps away, picks up another tape]
R: No, no,no! Oh…
JK: Christmas!!! [Rich looks at the present in disgust] Here it is, Rich [Hands him the tape] the final Christmas movie of the night [Rich unwraps it] Oh, Christmas time, full of wonder and cheer!
R: Ohh! Ok, ok. Christmas Vacation 2
JK: Oh, no
R: It’s a movie
JK: Oh, Jesus. [Reads the back] “When Cousin Eddie joined Clark Griswold and his family from National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation, [An ominous sound builds up, the camera slowly zooms in on Rich] the movie quickly became a holiday institution. An institution, of course, is where many think Cousin Eddie should reside [Chuckles] Randy Quaid again plays crude but lovable Eddie, and Miriam Flynn returns as his wife in another comic skid on the vacation banana peel [Rich covers his face with his hand] In a way, Christmas has always been a test of survival for Eddie and his-- (maybe someone else can describe this part for me)

[16:39] R: Which, according to grandpa, was the original Nazi symbol instead of the schwashtika

[17:41] Professor Physics: Driven to select the genetically perfect human mate, the proverbial virgin of course, holy midnight consummation on Christmas Eve
Dan Haggerty: Wait a minute
JS: While he’s talking, it just goes right--it cuts to the little girls and they’re just sitting there and they’re just listening
Professor Physics: The elves were a genetic engineering experiment
R: “And the Nazis had rape experiments, and--” [Laughs]
JS: They’re just watching!
JK: And they’re like, “really, daddy? What’s--what’s a gas-powered dildo?”
M: What’s a rape experiment? Like how does that work?
R: Well, I--I don’t think anyone is gonna willingly fuck that troll, so obviously this is a rape experiment [Jack laughs, Jessi covers her eyes, Mike chuckles silently, then Jay and Rich start laughing] Why the fuck would anybody think that’s the master race? It’s this disgusting little two foot tall troll! The Nazis really wanted to crossbreed humanity with those things? To create a master race?
M: So they could--[Shrugs]
R: They run around in the woods and eat their own shit! [More laughter]
M: Hey, they eat bugs, ok? Not--not their own shit
R: Do you--do you remember at the end, when the troll’s about to rape the girl, and then he sees the bug? [Laughing] And he grabs the bug….
(...)
JK: In Germany in the 1940s there was a rash of dick-stabbing assassins and no one figured it out until today
R: That would--that would strike fear into my heart. “Stay in...stay in--stay in line with the Nazi party or we’re gonna stab your dick!”
JK: “Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir!”
M: “Or else we’ll shove a knife in your balls”
JS: Not just once, (?) over and over and over

[20:14] JK: Jay, where did find this movie?
J: I found it at a pawn shop in South Dakota
JK: This--pawn--
J: Twelve years ago
JK: Jay found this at a pawn shop in South Dakota….great find

[20:31] J: His little floppy hands
JK: The perfect assassin

[21:05] R: The little disgusting troll was just attempting foreplay
JK: Yeah!
R: I mean he--
M: Ohh, he was trying to be, like--
R: I think so
JK: He was warming her up, yeah
R: He was in love with her, it wasn’t rape to him

[21:22] JS: “My inner monologue is outer”

[21:42] R: And--and instead of throwing the bomb out the window, he jumps out of the car

[22:58] JK: It was as if...they had just told him that his mother died, before the movie started
M: Or they just told him that he was acting in Elves. But really, I mean, if you read the script to this…
JK: I don’t know, it--maybe--maybe it reads better
R: Yeah, I’m sure--[Jay, Rich, and Jessi laugh]

[23:37] JS: “Grizzly Adams, you don’t know how to read!” [Rich and Jack laugh]
M: That was the longest trail-off of Rich Evans’ laugh I’ve ever heard

[23:57] M: Well, our next film, uh--[Picks up the tape] simply titled “Santa Claus” was on a….3 movie dvd collection...of, um, Santa Claus Classics. Uh, “classics” does not have sixteen around it, as it should [““““““““Classics””””””””” is written on screen]

[26:19] JK: Santa’s got his blowjob machine all ready [Mike laughs]
J: Oh my god!
JS: Oh god
M: Oh…
J: An early(?) fleshlight?
[At the table]
JS: Which is half the size of the wall
M: Yeah
JS: It’s--it’s huge
M: Santa has a very huge, huge cock
JK: Yeah 
[Jessi’s eyes widen and drops her jaw, everyone laughs]
R: [Covers his mouth] Gaawwwwwwwd
JS: He’s constantly giving, giving, giving…
R: OOOHHHHH
M: Santa’s a giver
R: Ohhh!
JK: Damn, girl!
M: Yeah, where’s Mrs.Claus in this whole scenario?
JS: No. Merlin
JK: Don’t need no Mrs.Claus
M: [Chuckles and snorts] Merlin’s the bottom?
JK: Ah ha ha! He’s a power bottom, so he--
M: He’s a power bottom?
JK: He gives back, you know what I’m saying?
JS: How he, how he, you know…
M: He’s very...ma--magic, every time they get together
JK: Well, no, ‘cause you can tell Merlin kinda walks a little funny [Rich cackles]
M: Yeah, he’s got a real…
JK: He’s hurt, he’s hurt from the night before...
JS: He probably has a potion. He probably has a potion for every time Santa comes into his room at night
(...)
M: It’s the--called his “erase my memory” potion

[28:20] JK: He had like an ear satellite thing, and of course, a giant vagina on the wall

[29:05] JK: They--the only reason the movie got made, is because it was uh, produced by the dry ice king of (?)
R: “We got all this dry ice here, you wanna...make a Santa Claus movie?”

[29:35] M: They live with the hairy-chested blacksmith
JS: Oh yeah, who’s in one scene with no shirt 
M: He--he pounds the metal all day, uh, Santa Claus comes in and asks him to make him a key for his keyhole 
[Silence]
JK: Was that--was that like a metaphor for--
M: I think so

[29:56] R: I would love to find out if these are all real Santa Claus myths, or if the filmmakers--
M: This is the result of tequila [Rich and Jack laugh] It’s tequila and dry ice 
JS: It’s one long night of margaritas and…[Mike nods]
JK: Hmm-hmm
R: They wake up and there’s like a film reel on their bed
J: “What did we do last night?”
JS: “Oh my god, did we make a movie?!”
JK: “Oh, no, not again!”
M: “Just call it ‘Santa Claus’” [Everyone laughs even louder]
JS: “Wait, what happens in it? I don’t know, whatever, man”
R: Oh god, can you imagine how much we’re *not* going to laugh when we talk about Christmas Vacation 2? [Everyone erupts with laughter]
(...)
M: “What happened last night? I don’t knooooow”
JS: “Where did all these children come from?!” 
(...)
[Rich gets up and leaves while laughing]
R: I hurt! I hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

[32:21] [Jesse lowers her head, Jay laughs in the background]
JS: I’m sorry! I just flashbacked to them, like, [Groggy] “oh god…”
JK: “Are we sure we made a Santa Claus movie? Who--who got the Merlin hat? [Jessi and Rich laugh] “I don’t know, man. We put it together later”
JS: “Where did this castle come from?”
M: I pictured them on the beach, like, in Mexico, they just wake up in the morning, there’s all this shit everywhere….Couple of kids just don’t wake up [Everyone dies of laughter]
M: The one in the sombrero’s (?)
JK: “Quick! Quick, pack up that giant doll costumes and let’s run!”

[33:21] [Everybody’s laughing, it suddenly cuts to them continuing their discussion]

[35:15] [Nobody wants to talk about Christmas Vacation 2, everybody frowns]
M: Let’s talk about Christmas Vacation 1!
[Everyone immediately perk up and start talking about their favorite parts, Jessi replaces Christmas Vacation 2 with Christmas Vacation 1]
JK: Oh, that’s a great movie!
R: Remember--remember--do you remember the lights, that would blind everybody?
JS: That is so great! That was so great!
JK: They had to turn on the auxiliary nuclear power?
JS: And then when the neighbors kept spilling stuff and then when they’re cleaning up, the lights would go back on and (?) “ohh!”
R: Squirrel…..How does that contrast with Christmas Vacation 2?
M: Ohh…[Takes down the CV1 tape and replaces it with the CV2 tape]
[Silence]
JK: [Unenthusiastically] Do you...do you remember the--the scene where the dog farted?
R: No. Do you--you remember when--when--when...he was dumber than the...the chimpanzee?

[38:16] JK: My--my guess is that Eric Idle said “I will work for one day, you get me for one day if you give me a whole bunch of money, I will come and fall down in your movie”
R: Did they--did they have a bunch of money to give anybody, though?
JS: I don’t--you know…
R: I guess Ed Asner’s in it
JK: They shot this--
R: They have Ed Asner money
JK: This was incre…[Jessi and Mike laugh] There you go. That’s the movie. They got Ed Asner…
M: A cupitall--a couple of hundred dollar bills and a case of beer?
JS: Some--some bourbon and they’re set?
M: Some--his diabetes medicine?
R: Haha! Were they withholding his diabetes medicine unless he was in the movie?

[39:29] JK: The highlight of the movie, for us, was the fact that a fictional character was from the town we live in
Cousin Eddie: Do you know where we are?
Lady: I’m from Milwaukee, I don’t know much about these islands
All: [Weak cheers]
JS: Alright!
[At the table]
M: The interesting thing is that’s what the screenwriter thought, “what’s the farthest thing, the most remote thing from the tropics that I could possibly think of?” Milwaukee is often the butt of jokes in movies, like “where are you from? Milwaukee,” it’s a joke, you know, it’s kind of sad. But it’s true

[39:59] R: I can summarize the movie for you, ok? Randy Quaid is stupid. I’m not talking about the character Cousin Eddie...I mean Randy Quaid is stupid
M: Don’t forget the director and the screenwriter
R: And the director is stupid, and the screenwriter is stupid

[40:22] [Movie randomly fades out]
M: They faded out ‘cause Ed Asner died in the middle of the shot

[41:56] M: He’s jamming, uh, luggage in the trunk, that’s the joke

[42:54] R:...and he’s so dumb, there’s no way that anyone other than a small, retarded child could ever possibly relate to him
[Mike leans forward and stares at the camera](?)

[51:07] M: This is a Best of the Worst first…..we ask our nonpartisan cameraman to break the tie. Who’s--
J: Ellllllves!
M: Ok! [Slaps the Santa Claus tape down, pushes the losing tapes off the table]
[Rich and Jack laugh]
M: Elves is the Best of the Worst!
JK: [Slaps the table] Fuck you, Bauman!

[51:23] [Mike and Jack are standing by a paper shredder]
J: What are you guys up to?
JK: Uh, Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie’s Island...Christmas Vacation...was the most insulting movie, I think, either of us have seen in quite some time
M: Yes, that’s fair to say, that’s accurate
JK: And so, we wanted to find the most brutal way to dispose of the movie
M: Other than shooting it with guns
(...)
[The paper shredder rejects the tape]
M: The shredder doesn’t like the movie
(...)
M: So after we shredded the DVD of Christmas Vacation 2, we put it a ziploc bag and now we’re preparing to mail it back where it came from, which is Warner Brothers Pictures. And that’s care(?) of director Nick Marck
JS: We’re also including a letter, and that letter reads, “Dear Warner Brothers, Why did you do this? Sincerely, Best of the Worst”
[They drop it off in a mailbox]

[53:30] [In the “Films Featured” section of the credits, Christmas Vacation 2 is excluded]
