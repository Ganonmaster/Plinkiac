Rich: Hey, Josh! Merry Christmas!
Josh: Oh, Merry Christmas to you, Rich, how are ya?
R: I’m doing great, so what are we doing this fine holiday season?
JH: Oh, well, look at all these presents we’ve got under the tree here
R: Oh! Presents under the tree, that sounds exciting [Looks around] 
JH: Yeah, do you see the tree, see how we decorated the tree?
R: No, where--where--where’s the tree?
JH: It’s right here
R: What do you mean?
JH: It’s right here
R: [Looks at where the tree should be] No, it’s not
JH: Yeah, it’s right here
R: No
JH: Yeah, look, it’s right here. It’s right here
R: What? [Looks down]
JH: It’s right here [Camera pans down, there is a tiny tree surrounded by presents on the floor]
R: [Disappointed] Oh. Last one on the lot, huh?
JH: It’s the size of my heart
R: Hmm. So what’s the gimmick?
JH: So the deal is, so we got two big options in all these presents under the tree. One of them is Christmas specials. The other option is Cannon Movie classics. Action films that make you proud to be an American, or something
R: That sounds fucking awesome
JH: Right? 
R: Nothing--
JH: It’s gonna be fun
R: Nothing says “Merry Christmas” like Charles Bronson with a .45 [A Very Cannon Christmas title card appears] Okay, so half of these are Cannon films and the other half are, like, Christmas stuff
JH: Yeah
R: Okay. Alright so what’s--
JH: Total luck of the draw
R: What’s--what’s the metagame here? Because I really--I really want a Cannon action film
JH: Hmm-mhm
R: Then we got this little oddball thing here [Picks up a cube, Josh mumbles] I don’t know, that doesn’t really looks like it’s gonna be a DVD--[Mumbles]--well maybe it’s probably just a DVD, but it’s not, like, the full case [They talk over each other]
JH: It cannot be a VHS tape. I can say that much
R: Cannon film I’m gonna say is the VHS tape
JH: I like the way you think it(?)
R: So I’m gonna-I’m gonna open one of these bigger guys
JH: Hmm
R: Oh [Picks up a box]
JH: This one 
R: Gonna go with this one
JH: That looks good
R: [Opens the top] Alright
JH: I like the way you think, Rich
R: [Rips apart the wrapping, revealing a box] Oh no. There’s--there’s another layer...to this mystery
JH: Uh oh. Uh oh [Rich opens the box] YES!!!
R: YES!! Yes!! [Shows off the tape] Death Wish 3! Yes! Great start!
JH: It’s the best Christmas ever
R: Great start! I was worrying about the VHS, but I got my--I got my Cannon action film
JH: It worked out
R: Alright
Jay: [From off screen] Did you get your wish? 
R: I got my Christmas gift. Thank you, Santa
J: No, “wish”
R: Wish?
J: Death Wish
R: Ohhhhh! *Movie #1 Death Wish 3* [Reads the tagline] “He’s Judge, Jury, and Executioner!”
JH: That’s the whole point of all this--of all series, I thought
R: “If he can’t find justice, he’ll make his own.” Is it--is it clear he’s a vigilante?
JH: I--hmm
R: Is it clear?
JH: Hmm
R: “Paul Kersey doesn’t seek out violence. It just seems to find him. But when it does, he’s not about to back down. Charles Bronson brings out the heavy artillery in this guns-blazing, no-holds-barred thriller! Road-worn and battle-weary, Kersey longs to leave his fighting days behind him, but when he arrives in New York to visit an old friend,” who probably gets murdered and raped
JH: Yeah
R: “He finds him brutally attacked and gasping for breath in a pool of blood. Now, the silent avenger must wage war once more on the city’s punks--”
JH: Only once more [Death Wish 4 poster appears]
R: “And hoodlums”
JH: Only once more [Death Wish 5 poster appears] 
R: “This time, he brought a small arsenal of guns, knives, and even a bazooka, to help him! [Josh throws up his hands] Special features: original theatrical trailer”
JH: Ooh!
R: So…
JH: Good
R: They went all-out on this release
JH: They didn’t include a menu? [Rich looks over the tape] So you can pick the chapters?
R: No, but the sound is mono
JH: Ahh, that’s special! 
R: Yeah
JH: That’s special. So you want to--you want to be able to hear every little, uh, uh, gunshot
R: In--in--in…[Josh says something] focus
JH: Yes
R: Focus. They don’t want you distracted with sounds coming from your left or right, that’s confusing bullshit
JH: Exactly
R: This is straight...straight at you like Charles Bronson, just--uh--[Sticks his arm out towards Josh]--to the point [Josh nods] 

[4:46] J: “Yay, murder!” [Rich and Josh laugh]
JH: “We love it!” [Jay laughs, then Rich laughs] 
J: “We never thought to murder anyone before!”
JH: That’s just--that’s fucking nuts

[5:08] [Mike walks in]
Mike: Hello, I am also wearing a Spock t-shirt. I see we’re doing the presents thing again
JH: Now remember, Mike, half of these are Christmas movies and half of--
M: Ehh whatever [Starts opening a present] Let’s open this one, I get it, I get it. This isn’t my first rodeo [There is another package under the wrapping paper] The fuck, really? Another thing to open?
JH: Make some more--
M: Don’t got all day here
JH: Don’t you?
M: [Mutters] I do, actually [Opens the package] The Christmas Tree, oh, that’s an original title 
JH: Oh
*Movie #2 The Christmas Tree* 
M: Is it telling that the first thing I look for is the running time?
JH: Eh--no--that--that--that--uh--uhw--wh--what is it?
M: 245 minutes
JH: Oh, fuck my life
M: [Sighs] Collectible Classics The Christmas Tree featuring cartoon characters I do not recognize, but look like a ripoff of the Whoville...characters, right? “The poor children who live in Mrs. Malvida’s orphanage…”
JH: Hmm
M: “...have never had Christmas presents. They’ve never even heard of Santa.” Well, this sounds like it’s gonna be a blast. “The cold hearted Mrs. Malvida doesn’t believe in such foolishness!”
JH: Ok, I’m with her. I’m with her
M: Yeah, I agree with her
JH: Yeah
M: I’m gonna...I’m gonna relate to her character the most
JH: Yeah
M: Um, “the cold hearted--” oh, I read that [Josh laughs] Uhh “despite their hardships, the hopeful tykes still find reason to celebrate beneath the branches of a stately pine tree that grows just outside their window” [Looks up] What? I guess that’s their Christmas tree?
JH: There’s a tree outside
M: They have to shiver (?) in the cold….
JH: Eh (?)
M: Ehh “when an energetic young moth…”
JH: Moth?
M: Oh, I’m sorry. There’s --it’s a hyphenated, it’s a….
JH: Oh
M: What you call that when you format text to fit, like, the newspaper?
JH: Uh, justify
M: Justify, thanks. “When an energetic young moth and her two adorable children come to work in the orphanage...[Josh laughs] the ragamuffin tots hope for a real Christmas! But if not Mrs. Malvid has anything to say about it!” She doesn’t want Christmas, she doesn’t like--she’s a scrooge [Josh nods]....without saying she’s Scrooge
JH: Right
M: ‘Cause it’s copyrighten (?)
JH: No, it’s not, it’s really old
M: Oh yeah, that’s Charles Dickenson…?
JH: Yep
M: Charles Dickens?
JH: Janice Dickens
M: Janice Dickens?
JH: Yes
M: Jane Error?
JH: Yeah
M: The Jane Error of Her Ways Was Writing--? [Josh shakes his head, Mike looks down at the tape, Rich giggles in the background] Ah god…”if Mulvida has anything to say about it, will she actually chop down the children…” wha--oh!
JH: What?!
M: “Will she actually chop down the children’s beloved tree?”
JH: [Disappointed] Ohhh
M: I’m--I’m looking at the name of the production company, Flamarion Ferreira Films
JH: Oh, yeah
M: It sounds “foreign.” Huh, great, “region coded” [Gasps]
JH: Oh?
M: Oh, thank God
JH: Seriously?
M: Yeah, “region coded...A.L.A.”? Oh, it says “all.” 
JH: Oh fuck!
M: Fuck! Let’s go watch The Christmas Tree
JH: Fine

[8:54] [Jay walks in]
J: Hey, Josh! Merry Christmas!
JH: Merry Christmas, Jay! Where’s your Spock shirt? You know this is our first Christmas without Leonard
J: Wasn’t Leonard Nimoy Jewish? 
[Silence]
JH: Yep! So do you want to pick out a movie?
J: Sure!
JH: Remember, half of them are Christmas movies--
J: Yeah, I know, it was my idea
JH: Oh
J: [Picks out a present] I’m gonna open this one
JH: Okay! That looks like a movie
[Jay starts ripping the wrapping paper]
J: Oh my gawd [Turns the tape around, Chuck Norris’ head appears where the paper was ripped] 
JH: OHHHHHH shit
J: Which one is it?
JH: I don’t know, it’s the best--[Jay removes the wrapping paper, Chuck Norris Invasion U.S.A. is written on the cover]--oh hohoho [Starts laughing and claps]
J: Chuck Norris in Invasion U.S.A. *Movie #3 Invasion U.S.A.* “The best of Chuck Norris,” I’m guessing--[Josh begins to say something]--I’m guessing that was a very short-lived series of DVDs
JH: Umm….
J: All right, a Joseph Zito film, who we all remember as the director of the best Friday the 13th sequel [Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter poster appears]
JH: That’s right
J: Uh, “America wasn’t ready….but he was” [Josh laughs] Oh, Richard Lynch is in this too, that’s great. “When America faces invasion for the first time in history, it’s up to one-man army Matt Hunter,” that’s a very, uh, appropriate last name--
JH: Hmm-mhm
J: “(Action superstar Chuck Norri)s--
JH: That’s right
J: “To wage war upon the enemies of freedom [Josh chuckles] On suburban streets, in shopping malls, and even in churches!”
JH: In WHAT?!
J: “The firepower explodes in...megaton fury...death-defying stunts escalate…” is this even English?
JH: I don't’ know
J: This is very choppy, uhh…”and death-defying stunts escalate into a heart-stopping climax when Hunter...America’s doomsday weapon…” [Josh snickers] What?
JH: [Stammers] Apparently he’s the doomsday weapon
J: “Launches his final plan....A ragtag army of terrorist mercenaries led by Soviet agent Rostov (Richard Lynch) catches America unprepared and makes it a war zone from sea to shining sea. Only one man can stem the…” [Stammers] He’s gotta fight the terrorists
JH: So it’s--
J: I get it
JH: So it’s--
J: I get it
JH: Yeah
J: It’s Chuck Norris versus the terrorists
JH: Right, it’s Red-- (?)
J: [Points to the back of the tape] There’s like, there’s like…
JH: Oh my god
J: Five more sentences
JH: God 
J: I’m done
JH: So it’s--it’s--it’s Red Dawn meets Dr. Strangelove?
J: Well, who’s better at fighting an army or Russians, a bunch of little kids? Or one Chuck Norris?
JH: I think we’re gonna find out
J: Alright
JH: But, uh…[Stutters, whispers] It’s Chuck Norris
J: It’s the--it’s Chuck Norris, spoilers. Okay. He’s a one-man doomsday machine
JH: Yeah. Is Lea Thompson a one-na--a one-man doomsday machine?
J: The--no
JH: I don’t think so
J: Chuck Norris also never tried to fuck a duck

[11:34] Chuck Norris: If you come back in here...I’m gonna hit you with so many rights you’re gonna beg for a left
[Mike and Rich laugh]
J: “It sounded better in my head”

[12:16] R: He’s like the Bugs Bunny of action heroes

[13:20] J: All of his family has been raped and killed at this point, we’re the third movie in. They were all raped to death. Uh, his wife, his daughter, um, his maid…
JH: Yeah
J: Uh, his mother
JH: Oh
J: Uh, the dog. Everybody’s been raped, so now he goes…
M: Somebody rapes his toupee, too? 

[13:50] [*Mike and Jay laugh at violent elderly abuse* is written on screen] 

[15:22] R: In--in Home Alone…[Looks at the camera] Home Alone starring Macaulay Culkin [Mouthing] Call us. Call us
M: Rich--Rich has a crush on you
JH: You don’t--
M: He wants to be home alone with you
JH: Oh
R: [Chuckles] Oh no

[15:52] J: Looks like an amusement park, the way the people are, like, the (?) extras are…
JH: Yeah
J: Like, layered. Looks like people wandering around Six Flags

[16:23] R: It looks like a movie
J: Yeah. Except for the fact that I think it’s supposed to be widescreen and we watched the four by 3 open matte, so, lots of headroom
(...)
M: “Charlie was 19 feet tall”

[16:40] M: No boom mics, though. A lot of booms...but no boom mics

[18:58] M: Is that Ernest Borgnine?
JH: No, it’s Martin Balsam
M: [Disappointed] Ohh gosh
JH: Yeah
M: It’s a low-rent Ernest Borgnine [Jay and Josh laugh]
R: Ernest Borg-not [Mike and Jay chuckle]
JH: Oh
M: Or in German, Ernest Borg-nein

[23:25] J: Are we talking about Marina Sirtis and how she violently gets raped in this movie?
M: Yes [Plays clip] Well, they rip her shirt off and it’s horrible
J: Well, I will say this movie i--is, uh, much lower...uh, than the first two when it comes to the violent rape. This one’s just a little rapey, which I’ll take
M: We saw--
J: I’ll take that over, over very rapey
M: We saw the Cannon Films documentary and Marina Sirtis is briefly interviewed in that
J: Yes
M: And--and can you describe...what she said in that?
J: Oh, well she basically said that Michael Winner’s like a creepy sex pervert and how sh--uh, while they were setting up lights and stuff, she wanted--’cause she’s laying there on, like, this dirty, filthy mattress and she’s topless or whatever, and, and she wanted, like, a blanket ‘cause it was cold
M: She was freezing--
J: She was freezing and Michael Winner’s like “no. We can’t light it properly unless I see your tits.” And that’s the director of the Death Wish films
JH: Yeah
[Pause]
R: That makes perfect sense

[25:21] [Mike talks about how Marina Sirtis said she’s grateful she doesn’t have to do dirty movies anymore because of the Star Trek fans] (?)
J: Would you say that, that, uh, knowing that story has now tarnished your enjoyment of Death Wish 3?
M: A little bit, yeah. I mean, uh, if that director is a legit, like, creeper and--and treated his actors like dirt and like, yeah, that’s awful. That’s awful
J: But the movie’s fucking awesome ‘cause he has a bazooka
M: The movie is awesome…
J: So it’s all worth it

[26:03] JH: She’s a Greek actress that’s playing a--a--a Latina woman. Which...is very odd, we were all initially confused by is like “the--the actor looks like maybe he’s a black guy and Marina Sirtis is Greek and they’re both supposed to be Latino…”
R: Are you--are you--are you adoption-shaming? She could’ve been adopted by a Hispanic family
M: Josh is very against blended families
R: Very--? Oh my god
M: Especially light-skinned African American men with Latino accents marrying Greek Latina women 
J: Well I--[Everyone laughs] 
M: It’s a very--very, very specific demographic
J: Well I would say if we learned anything between these two movies--[Points to the two Cannon films]--tonight, it’s that Cannon films, doesn’t matter your ethnicity as long as you get mowed down by old white dudes…
JH: That’s true. That’s true

[27:02] R: “I’ve got a plan to save the neighborhood...I mail ordered a gun” [Everyone laughs]
JH: I love that scene though, then he gathers all of his other friends from the building to “come look at this gun that I mail ordered, look at it’s--”
J: “This doesn’t help you in any way, but I have a gun”
JH: Yes, it’s--
R: “I am physically aroused”
JH: “When I make my own bullets,” and, like, it’s very--he’s--he’s really catching the wave of New York City making some artisanal bullets 
J: Yeah. “This gun’ll make them more dead”

[27:37] R: Like, there’s a lot of good things in the action scenes in this movie, but every action scene with Charles Bronson is just--[Makes shooting gesture with hands] (?)
JH: Rich, he’s 112 years old, what do you want from him?
R: I’m fine with it!
M: Rich, you’re--
R: I’m fine with it!
M: He moved any faster his toupee would fly off

[32:02] M: I mean it’s probably the best film I’ve ever seen in my whole life 

[32:55] M: The person that made this, their name is Flamerion Ferreria, the weirdest name ever. Probably a foreigner, as we discussed
J: Chuck Norris needs to come after him

[34:33] M: I think they used the audio from, like, the Jim Jones cult

[39:08] JH: This story could not handle more than one bad guy
J: This story can’t handle a story

[41:18] M: “Judy’s gonna come over and pick a ‘package’ up from you. And--”
J: He wants--he wants--she wants him to put his “package in her purse”
M: His fri--frisky fingers
J: He wants--he uses his “frisky fringers to put his package in her purse”
M: No, well, y--yeah, he was gonna hide a valuable object in his house--
J: A “valuable object”
M: Wait half an hour, and then call the police
J: Yes
M: So that it seemed like--like Judy stole a valuable object from his house. With--with frisky fingers. You know what would’ve been funny is if that little girl overhears the co--phone conversation between Mulva and the guy and it all sounds like innuendo and the little girl interpreted it as that [Everyone laughs] Not--”he’s gonna rape you! [More laughter] He was meaning literally. Gonna put something in her purse. For (?) something in her purse”
JH: “Oh, that’s still bad”
M: “Oh, I thought you were talking about fucking her to death.” ‘Cause these orphans have lived a hard life
JH: They have
J: They expect the worst
M: Yeah, they--they’re not
JH: They make friends with trees

[43:06] M: Is this The Lord of the Rings? Jesus Christ

[43:15] J: “And I’m out of food so I’m going to have to eat you”
R: [Laughs] The scene where he has to pick up the rock

[46:29] J: Yeah, I have no idea, like, if this aired...somewhere, or if it just came into being…
JH: Well, it’s a Collectible Classic
J: Someone discovered it in a castle, I have no idea how this film came to exist

[47:02] M: Whenever I see something like this, I always--I always imagine, like, ‘cause the characters, they look Disney-ish
JH: Hmm-mhm
J: Yeah
M: They look 90s Disney-ish, and I always picture someone...some sucker buying it, putting it on for their kids, “mommy, this is shitty!” “Oh yeah, it is. We got it at the dollar store”

[53:14] J: He doesn’t look anything like David Bowie
[“Best of the Worst Fun Fact: Richard Lynch looks exactly like David Bowie” appears] 

[54:23] M: Chuck Norris, he’s a former guy…
J: He’s still a guy

[55:17] [Chuck Norris stands in the middle of a decimated house] J: “I think I can fix this”

[1:04:10] R: We’ve wrapped it up, that was Christmas…[Gets up]
J: Oh, I guess we’re just done
R: Goodbye. Done [Leaves]
J: He’s pulling a Charles Bronson, he’s not caring
M: [To the camera] If it’s not too late to ask Santa for something, ask him for a copy of Death Wish 3
