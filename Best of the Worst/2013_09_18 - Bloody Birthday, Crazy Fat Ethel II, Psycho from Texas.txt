[Gillian stuffs some movie-related items into a tote bag and up her shirt]
Jay: What are you doing?
[Camera pans around, Jay is eating popcorn from a bowl in his hand]
J: So Gillian! You were in our film Feeding Frenzy--
Gillian: I was!
J: Uh, you were on an episode of Half in the Bag…
G: I was!
J: Where we suffered through The Black Ninja
G: Yeah
J: For some reason, I guess you’re back for more?
G: Who wouldn’t want to come back for this? [Gropes(?) Jay’s stomach]
J: Oh my god
G: Milwaukee beer bellies
J: That’s completely understandable and not weird at all. Uh, but let’s watch the movies!
G: Yeah, let’s watch movies!
*Movie #1: Bloody Birthday (1981)*
J: Bloody Birthday [Shows the cover of the tape]
G: Couldn’t be more excited
J: Julie Brown, from MTV, is in it
G: Downtown--
J: Not Downtown Julie Brown
G: Not Downtown
J: The other Julie Brown, the goofy redhead Julie Brown
G: Ok. “The nightmare begins with the kids next door”
J: Yes. This is about little kids that murder people violently. Uh, directed by Ed Hunt
G:...Sure. I love that guy and his work--his work...I take all of my film knowledge from Ed Hunt. Remember him?
[Silence]
J: [Reads the back] “In 1970, three children were born during a total eclipse of Saturn, the planet governing emotion”
G: I--Yeah [Nods]
J: “Years later, these seemingly innocent children have become heartless killers. What happens when a teenage girl and her younger brother stumble upon the horrible truth?” This--this kid here--[Points to a kid with a gun]--looks pretty threatening, right?
G: Uhh, his Rick Moranis impression is pretty killer

[2:19] J: So what do we have next?
G: Ok, the next movie we have is Fat Ethel 2
J: Well, “crazy…”
G: Oh, sorry! Crazy Fat Ethel 2
J: I--I think it’s pretty clear, based on their design, that that’s how it’s supposed to be read
G: “Thirteen years ago, Ethel was judged criminally insane and now the mental ward is overcrowded--budget--the budget has been cut so Ethel is back on the streets”
J: I think they’re talking about the budget of the movie, right?
G: Uh, right
J: Did we make that joke before? 
[Cuts to Mike and Colin standing by the Wheel in the previous episode]
Mike: [Reading the box] “And the budget has been cut…” Oh. Oh! For the mental ward
Colin: Right
M: Not the movie
C: Yeah
J: We should point out that, uh, none of us have ever seen or heard of Crazy Fat Ethel 1. And then the good thing about this movie--uh, runtime: 60 minutes
G: You know--that’s when you know you’ve(?) a quality film [Jay laughs] For a reason…
J: You get in and you get out
G: Yes, like...a lady [Background music stops, Jay nods]

[3:55] [Camera focuses on Ethel chewing with her mouth open]
Jessi: Ew! Ew!
[Mike tries to block out the television screen with his hand]

[4:10] J: So finally, we have--I don’t know, maybe this is about you, I guess we’ll find out, it’s called Psycho From Texas
G: I’m glad that--I’m glad you found this film, uh...because that’s actually me [Points to the woman on the cover]
J: Oh!
G: And when I was blond, and older, and naked
J: Well--
G: I do like to--when I’m in Texas I usually like to go topless, that’s the thing about me, and I feather my bangs
J: Is that a Texas thing or is that just you?
G: Only if you’re psycho. Only psychos. It’s like a marker to the rest of Texas like where your mental standing is(?)
J: So they’re like “oh hey look! Psycho”
G: Right
J: Ok. Well, it’s a shocker
G: It is a shocker
J: Um, not THE shocker
G: No
J: Just A shocker. Uh, but this is brought to us by the good people at Paragon Video. Which is the mark of quality
G: They did a lot of work with Ed Hunt, didn’t they?
J: It’s possible, yeah, but there’s one image on the back, this is all we get. I--I don’t even know what’s happening here [Shows Gillian the picture] [Stammers] Something getting shoved in his neck, I think
G: Ronald McDonald is getting spearfished in the face
J: Ok
G: Sorta
J: Well, that happens in the movie, then this whole day will be worth it
G: What does the back say?
J: Uh, “he was a stranger....and a killer.” There’s no punctuation at the end of that, so I’m gonna assume that goes on with the rest of the sentence, so, “he was a stranger...and a killer a quiet southern town is disrupted by the kidnapping of a wealthy oil man and a series of needless, insane killings.”

[6:00] [Suddenly cuts to a man’s face, then to a person in a bed]
R: Now that’s a transition!

[8:03] Jack: Saturn rules your emotions, if you believe in hibbity jibbity

[8:40] M: What would you say the plot is, Jay?
J: Well, the plot is kids just sort of kill...their scenes where they stalk people, they kill some people, uh, there’s an extended subplot involving cake
[Cuts to a pointless scene showing several people eating cake]

[11:46] JK: There was no thought put into any...there--this movie fucking sucked

[12:16] G: That was their disposal of the body, was they just left it in an alley?

[13:16] JK: I mean, I don’t know about you guys, but I get undressed--[Gillian dances in her seat]--and dance at the exact same time every day
J: Do you use a boa?
JK: I--you know, not a boa, uh, because I’m a guy, so I just use some gym socks tied together
[13:35] [A boy approaches a clown juggling wearing a shirt that says “I can’t say no” on it]
M: Oh my god
JS: Oh no
M: “I can’t say no”?
J: Jesus Christ!
JK: Oh my god! What a creepy clown…
J: This movie suddenly got genuinely scary
[At the table]
JK: The creepiest part of the movie was the birthday clown that we see for 5 seconds
J: Yeah
G: What does his shirt say?
J: “I can’t--”
G: “I can’t say no”
J: “I can’t say no”
G: I mean, there’s a lot of things you could do with that information
M: They showed him for a brief second and he looked like Bagul
[Exorcist theme plays over clip, camera zooms in on the clown smiling]

[14:12] [A woman splashes water on a child and stuffs him in a trunk]
G: Water?! That’s what…[Jay laughs]
J: What!
M: This is so bizarre
G: Where did that--
JK: They splashed water on him?
[Jay laughs heartily]
JK: Like he was a witch?
[At the table]
J: Well, the little girl gets away, what happens to the two little boys, they get sent to the--
M: They get arrested
G:...jail
J: --tiny psych ward or something?
M: I’m assuming they go to juvenile hall
JK: They go to a tiny jail
J: Where all the guards are little kids, too
JK: Ooh!
J: Wouldn’t that be adorable?
JK: That’d be adorable
J: I wanna watch that movie

[15:22] J: [To Gillian] So what’s your favorite Ed Hunt film?
G: Huh...there’s so many--
M: I really like Ed Hunt for Red October

[15:45] M: It’s insulting to everything, even chocolate pudding

[17:05] G: And Crazy Fat Ethel 2 is really terribly-shot...naps

[19:29] J: They put grandma in the movie
JK: Grandma was great, uh, she has the best line of the movie
[Grandma takes away a bag of pretzels]
Ethel: You give me those pretzels, granny!
Grandma: I will not
[Everyone laughs and claps]

[20:08] [A man stumbles/dances around a yard for 10 seconds]
JK: This is insane….Why is this happening?...Is...is this the director?
[After a second, Jay and Rich laugh]
Rich: The camera’s facing the wrong way? The actual scene’s behind him on the other side of the camera?
JK: Yes!

[25:33] [Fat Ethel runs outside and basks in the sunlight(?)]
R: Run off into the distance and then the movie can end
JK: Ten minutes of credits
J: If this movie is ten minutes shorter than it’s supposed to be, I’ll be very happy

[26:22] M: Well, everyone…
JK: [Groans]
M: Let’s move on to our third terrible film. And this--this is a worst of the worst episode, it makes you wonder about 2 decades of human history and what happened 
G: Hahahahaha!
JK: It’s not like, what was wrong with the human race, it was what was wrong with this guy? But--just put the name on the screen-- [“Produced and directed by Jim Feazell” appears on screen]--right here, that guy is fuck
J: Pffff!!!
M: I--yeah…
JK: Come at me, Jim!
J: He’s like 90 now
JK: Good! I can beat your ass, then

[29:07] M: This is the greatest fight scene

[29:44] [Rich runs in and hands some papers to Mike]
M: Oh, this just in!
J: What is this?
M: Breaking news! From Rich Evans
JK: Hold on. We have breaking news, coming from Rich Evans live in the other room
M: Rich Evans did some research on Crazy Fat Ethel and he discovered “Crazy Fat Ethel 1, originally titled ‘Criminally Insane.’ 61 minutes long, with a budget of 30 thousand dollars…”
G: Wow
M: “Remade… this year”
[Record scratch]
G: [Makes a confused expression(?)]
M: This year? “But shelved after the top investor died in June of this year”
J: Wow!
M: Rich Evans, this is...this is shocking news
J: [Deflates]
JK: Back--I--I’m sorry--
J: So anyway, back to--
JK: Back to Psycho…
G: I lost my shoe…[Looks under the table] Found it! I found it
JK: You guys we got breaking news...Gillian just found her shoe
M: Gillian--shoe(?) was lost but then it was found. We’ll report to you with more information
JK: Which, by the way, is more than what happens in Psycho From Texas

[32:18] J: Oh my god

J: Ohh, I see where this is going
M: [Tries not to laugh]
J: [Laughs]
JK: I’m sorry, Mike--[Takes the paper from Mike]--Mike can’t, uh--
M: I’m sorry, I’m having a moment
JK: My--my--my colleague is a little under duress at the moment. Umm, so, Satan’s Black Wedding, Wendy’s Naughty Night, Fire--[Crumbles(?)] I’m sorry--[Passes the sheet to Gillian]

G: Ok. Satan’s Black Wedding, Wendy’s Naughty Night, Fire In Her Bed…[Mike and Jack are trying to suppress laughter] and...Sex Weirdo

M: Oh, Sex Weirdo, I know that film

[36:37] M: Everyone’s awkward
J: Yeah…
M: Except for the director, I guess
JK: Who was furiously masturbating
M: Everyone was awkward
J: Yeah
M: Except for the director...and maybe Rich Evans
J: Pfff!!
JK: Who was furiously masturbating

[39:19] M: Gillian, your pick for best of the worst
G: [Exhales] I--I mean, they are all very terrible. Uh, but I guess I also will choose Crazy Fat Ethel 2, just for the befuddlement factor…? Uh, yeah, I...just...don’t understand the choices that would happen in one’s life to lead them to a place where they would make a two...of that
