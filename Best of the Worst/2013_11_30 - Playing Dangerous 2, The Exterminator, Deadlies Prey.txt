[Josh is standing and staring at the camera. He snaps his fingers, Jay appears]
Jay: Hey Josh, do you want to watch some movies?
[Pause]
Josh: Okay
[Jay loudly sips from his mug]
J: Okay so, Josh, this week we’re going to watch sequels to movies we’ve previously watched on Best of the Worst
JH: I was gonna say we watched these already, these look familiar to me
J: Yeah
JH: It, uh...they’re not quite. Uh, but we’ll start today with, uh, Playing Dangerous 2, [Reads the tagline] “never send a man to do a boy’s job” [Silence] [Reads the back] “Eleven year old Stuart Wolfe gets more than he bargained for when he joins an artificial intelligence program rather than attend summer camp. Uh, Stuart discovers that, instead of teaching computers to think, someone is using the program to steal information. The goal: America’s top scientific, financial, and military secrets”
J: Ooh
JH: That’s very efficient. “When Stuart tells his mentor Jack Harrison, Jack slips without realizing it and reveals he’s the mastermind of the conspiracy.” Spoilers!
J: This is giving the whole movie away
JH: [In a scolding sort of tone] Box!
[A bunch of kids and a man are laughing uncontrollably] 
J: Just an adult in a room full of drugged kids, no big deal [Jack laughs]
[While still laughing, the man points a gun at a kid]
J: Oh my god!
[They continue laughing]
J: This is getting weird
JH: What the hell….?

[1:37] J: So out next film is our inverted sequel, it’s--we already saw Exterminator 2, not knowing anything about the series, but now we have The Exterminator
JH: We’re gonna get some answers
J: It does star Robert Ginty, who I believe was the Exterminator in the first one, right?
JH: Yes. And the second one
[In the screening room]
J: I don’t know if this makes sense, but he looks like a little boy as an older man?
JH: Yeah
J: Does that make sense?
JH: Oh yeah
J: Ok
Jack: It’s like if a little boy was inflated
JH: Yeah
J: So yeah, maybe this will make the second movie make more sense, be more satisfying as a result of this? I don’t know...
JH: I don’t know. It’s not gonna have any Mario Van Peebles in it
J: [Reads the back of the box] “When Vietnam veteran John Eastland (Robert Ginty) learns that his best friend was left paralyzed at the hands of a New York street gang, he will not rest until they are brought to justice. [Josh nods] Eastland takes the law into his own hands and becomes a one-man task force who annihilates his buddy’s attackers, and goes on a hunt down the city’s entire dark underworld.” That’s the exact same thing as the second movie
JH: Yeah
J: Uh, “to the public, he’s a hero, but to law enforcement officials, The Exterminator is a psychopath capable of dangerously undermining and entire government administration”
JH: Okay
J: So they’re mad that he’s setting more people on fire than they are 
JH: I hope more grandparents get shot
J: Ooh! Yeah, we’ll see

[3:18] Rich: This is the most awkward car chase of all time. [Jay laughs] They’re crashing into things only because they can’t drive

[3:51] J: So, Josh, what is our final film of the night?
JH: Finally, Ted Prior...is the Deadliest Prey
J: Yes
JH: Deadliest. Oh, we are excited about this, we had a fantastic time watching Deadly Prey, uh, and the tagline obviously is a (?) just going right into it, “in Vietnam he was the best...now he has to prove it again!”
J: Oh, yes! They worked “again” into the...that’s my favorite tagline for sequels, he’s saying “it happened *again*?”
JH: Oh
Man #1: It might be happening again
Ted Prior: Doing this shit barefoot again
Man #2: I can’t believe (?) doing this shit to you again
J: Signed by Ted Prior himself
JH: Yes, very--
J: Minus mullet, unfortunately
JH: Oh, and he’s wearing pants
J: Yeah, these are all detriments--
JH: I know
J: As far as I’m concerned
Ted Prior: You gotta be kidding me. You gotta be kidding me
Man #3: You’ve gotta be kidding me, right?
JH: “Nearly 30 years ago, the highly decorated special forces soldier Mike Danton was inadvertently sucked into a violent game of cat and mouse with Colonel Hogan, his ex-commanding officer. [Colonel Hogan screams] Thrown out into the middle of the woods with nothing but a pair of shorts on his body and no weapons, Danton was forced to fight dozens of armed soldiers to survive, and he did, killing all but one”
[Colonel Hogan gets in a car]
Woman: It’s good to see you, Colonel. Look pretty good for having spent 25 years in that place
Col.: Hey! Stop talking and start driving, bitch
Woman: Hmmmm
[Rich and Jay laugh]
JH: “Ohhh that’s my colonel!” [Reading the box] “Now, all these years later, the one he left alive is coming back to haunt him as the bitter Colonel Hogan gets released from prison and immediately seeks out his revenge on Danton [Jay nods] And this time he is broadcasting every bloody moment of it to the public to prove to the whole world that he is in fact the very best there is”
J: Broadcasting it where?
JH: I don’t know yet. Uh--
J: This is his plan? Like “I want to broadcast me violently murdering you to show to the world...something…?”
JH: Jay…[Reads the last line] ”Some people just don’t learn”
J: We can only hope that some people just don’t learn, and by “some people,” I mean David and Ted Prior

[6:43] J: How does this stack up to Playing Dangerous Part 1?
R: It--it stacks up poorly, compared to Playing Dangerous Part 1--Playing Dangerous Part 1 was the story of Stuart, a young boy who had to defend his family from a terrorist who wanted a techno thing. Playing Dangerous 2 was the story of….
[Silence]
J: Yeah
R: Yeah
J: Yeah

[7:21] JK: [Laughs] This is sucks
J: Hey look, a Boglin!

[8:43] J: “I set him on fire but he’s gonna be alright”
JH: “He’s o...he’s only a little burnt to the bone”
R: They go out of their way to say he’s alive, even though Stuart would have no way of knowing this
J: Yeah. “Don’t worry, he’ll be ok, he ran out of the building in flames but I’m guessing he’s alright?”
JH: “He stopped and dropped and rolled”
JK: He did the flame calculations in his head, he’s a very smart kid so he knows the combustion rate of his poly nylon suit, he knows how long that’s gonna burn, flame retardant by the way, so he--I mean, the--he’s gonna be fine

[9:49] R: And the government secret?....E=mc squared [Jack laughs]
(...)
R: E=mc square was just hanging out on the defense website? [Jay laughs]
JK: Just as a friendly reminder…
R: Make sure nobody forgets an important piece of science
JH: (?) put smart crap on there, alright? You don’t wanna look stupid

[11:32] J: Rich, you’re a video game person, have you ever played a game where you can’t see what you’re supposed to be shooting at? Is that a game that exists?
R: [Giggles] Doom 3? [Jack laughs]
J: [Turns to the camera] Video game joke!

[11:54] [Stuart and some other adults drink apple juice boxes loudly for 10 seconds]
Man: Well, that was fun
[Jack guffaws, Jay covers his face]
J: Ahh, the famous apple juice-drinking scene!
JH:.....That happened

[12:36] [Stuart sits on the ground and covers his face]
[Rich laughs]
J: This is the realization that he’ll never get another job after this movie

[12:51] [The goofy roommate jiggles a plate of jello]
JK: Umm
R: What the fuck?
J: That kid just discovered drugs

[13:03] [Jack Harrison says he doesn’t want any jello]
Roommate: Are you sure? I’m talking live jello here
R: “Live”? Does he normally eat dead jello?
[At the table]
R: It was kind of mind bending ‘cause, he’s not only a terrible actor, but he’s a terrible actor reading terrible dialogue, it was like staring into infinity

[13:43] J: Finally...after an hour of boring computer bullshit, uh, the, the hen--the bad guy hires henchmen to chase Stuart around one hallway, it’s just the same hallway over and over
[Plays clip of the two henchmen running around one hallway]
R: It’s almost like the Scooby-Doo routine

[14:42] J: Explain what non-medy is, Rich
R: Ok. There are jokes that make you laugh, ok? And then there are jokes that you have no reaction to. But every now and then there’s a joke so bad...it makes you less laugh
[Clip plays]
Jack: I know you can’t be more than a hundred yards away
Stuart: There’s a lot of places a little kid can hide. Check your desk drawer, Jack [He looks] Jack, I was kidding
[In the screening room]
[Nobody laughs or says anything]
[Camera zooms in on Rich and Josh staring at the TV screen in silence]
JH: And then the amount of laughs…
R: Like you’ll be...you’ll be sitting there normal...and then the joke will happen and then you’ll move--[Frowns]--slightly less smile [Jay laughs] even though you weren’t smiling and--and that is called “non-medy”

[15:31] JK: They were *right* behind him
JH: They’re not very good at their job
R: He’s very fast
J: There was one mo--moment though, where Stuart cut loose. What happens?
JH: Oh my god, so he’s in the hallway
J: Yeah
JH: And he comes out of a door and then all of a sudden he’s doing monkey arms over his head and then he kind of glances at the camera like “ah ha I ruined *that* take.” Um, except it’s in the movie
J: But it’s in the movie! [Rich and Jack laugh]
JH: I do--I have--there’s no precedence for it, there’s no context for it, it’s so very, very clearly an outtake that for some reason...I don’t know, the editor was just “fuck this noise, that’s going in the movie”
J: The--the only that makes sense is that the director was not paying attention and they only did the one take, ‘cause why else would that be in the movie?
JK: But they didn’t need that shot like there was just a lot of random running in the exact same hallway...that they did not specifically need that shot, so someone *chose* to put in a monkey arm thing just to see if they could
J: Yeah. To see if the--ok, the director didn’t notice this when we were shooting, let’s see if he notices that we put it in the edit, and he didn’t notice it again
JH: Nope
JK: Well, the director was so busy just--uh, you know, being blackout drunk...
J: I guess. That--that little Stuart, he’s off to college now and all of his friends are making fun of him, “remember when you were a little kid in that movie and you were doing the monkey arms?”
JH: “Shut up!”
J: I think if you were--
R: I think if you were--you were drunk you’d be making a more interesting movie. He was--he was clinically depressed [Rich and Jay laugh]
JH: Just--just--just had his hands the entire…
R: He was all out of Prozac, he really hated himself, it was an attempted suicide [Jack laughs]
J: Making Playing Dangerous 2 was an attempt at suicide?
R: [Laughing] Yes!
J: That’s an amazing theory
JK: Suicide via boredom
JH: Rich, that’s the pull quote for the US (?) by the way

[18:31] [An injured man is lying down, he’s wearing a vest that says “US Army Flack Vest” on it]
JK: What?
JH: “Flack vest”
JK: Ohh “flack vest.” And I thought he--I thought he--I thought it said “black dick”

[20:00] J: Did they just cut out like, 5 scenes?
R: Yeah
[At the table]
R: They cut out all of that
J: It’s like they--it’s like they said, “you know what, all this expla--explanation for why he’s doing this is boring, just pull it out of the movie”
R: Here’s--here’s the deal though, we’re dealing with Robert Ginty here?...Ok…? Coke Zero? Mister Coke Zero doing...do we *really* want 20 minutes of him [Monotone] “I’m very upset--”
J: We don’t need 20 minutes, all we need is one scene! We need *something* to connect just those two sequences
JH: Literally just him picking up a flamethrower
J: And saying “I’m gonna exact revenge”
R: Ok. Yes
JH: He doesn’t even have to say that! He just has to look at it meaningfully, which I’m not sure he can do [The rest laugh] But he’s gotta-
JK: If he could--ok, how about this? If he looks at a flamethrower...
JH: That’s it!
JK: That’s it
JH: That’s enough! And we didn’t get it
J: It’s almost like that editing test where they just show someone’s face--[Written on screen is: Best of the Worst Fun Fact: This experiment is known as the Kuleshov Effect]--and then they cut to a bowl of soup, and then they cut to a person’s face and they cut to something else to--and that’s like, you get the emotion out of it. You just cut to that guy’s dull fucking face and then cut to a flamethrower and you’re like, “oh, revenge!”
JH: That’s it
J: That’s it, I get it
JH: That’s all that movie needed and they failed to do it
J: Yeah

[21:05] JH: Uh, meanwhile the cops...uh, one particular cop…
J: Hot dog cop?
JH: Hot dog cop. Uh--[Jack laughs]--the man is a genius with a lamp and some forks
[Plays clip]
[In the screening room] J: Wait, what is this? Did he put a--is that a hot dog?
R: Yes, it is
J: [Bewildered] What is--what is that? That’s...
JK: What?
J:....interesting. You know what? At least they’re doing something. It’s not him sitting there and he--talks on the phone and then that’s the scene. Like, at least they’re trying
[Hot dog cop realizes he screwed up his line, winces, and clarifies himself]
JH: Was that in the script or did they just leave that in?
J: I think that might’ve been something they just left in

[22:08] J: So weird that he got pulled back on a giant cord at the exact same time that Robert McGinty shot him

[24:56] R: We think--I think the protagonist though is supposed to be like, that the cop, hot dog cop, and he spends--he spends 90% of the movie dating Doctor British(?)
JH: Yeah
JK: That has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, like, just like, they go out on dates and seem to have a lovely time
[Rich spits out his drink, everyone laughs, they replay it in slow motion]

[27:12] R: [Echoes] What the fuck?!

[27:25] [A spoiler warning appears, it says: SPOILER WARNING! Normally we don’t care about spoilers on Best of the Worst, but considering that The Deadliest Prey is our first brand new movie, we felt compelled to give notice that we gave away the entire ending of the film]

[28:10] J: Josh, what’s the plot of Deadliest Prey?
JH: Have you seen Deadly Prey?
J: I have seen Deadly Prey
JH: That’s the plot of Deadliest Prey
J: [Feigns surprise] Oh!

[29:35] R: Dan Prior must’ve spent months at high schools studying the speech patterns of modern-day youth
JK: True dat
J: Yeah, yeah
Candy girl: No, man, this was for real, dude
[Jack nearly spit-takes]
R: Jack, you should have let the spit-take happen
JK: I didn’t wanna do it on the microphone…
Candy girl: Trace that video feed and figure out where that signal’s coming from
Man #!: Yeah. I mean, we’re hackers, if we can’t do this then no one else can
JK: Hey, man, dude, man, I will send you the URL
J: I love that they’re hanging out in the kitchen looking at things on the internet on laptops. These--these hackers, out of them, we discovered our favorite character of the movie, which is...her name is Candy Girl? I guess?
Jay and Rich: True dat
(...)
JK: There was one--there was one line of dialogue in which she starts and ends with “true that”

[31:30] J: If someone called me and said, “do you want to be in Ghoulies 5?” I would be there in a second

[32:02] R: It’s like--it’s like Dan Prior thought the internet was like a TV channel

[32:12] News anchor: We have to warn you, however, that many of these images are shocking, and we strongly recommend that you watch at your own discretion [Cuts to a close-up of Mike Danton’s face]
J: Oh, he has a copy of the movie

[33:50] R: That happened so slow, I didn’t have time to react

[34:32] [Mike Danton appears behind a soldier, lifts up a bloody knife]
Danton: Have a nice day
JK: What?
[Danton stabs the soldier]
D: Too late
JK: Why are you--
J: These catchphrases are the worst!
[At the table]
JH: They go so far back around that they pass non-medy
J: Yeah, yeah. This movie passed the non-medy scale, I would say

[35:26] R: And he--he also gets beaten to death with his own arm because this movie’s completely different

[39:53] JK: You even got a signed copy, right?
J: Yeah! This is signed by uh, uh, Ted Prior, who plays Danton, unfortunately it’s signed on the plastic, not on the actual sleeve [Removes the sleeve] uh, if you’re gonna sign a DVD, sign the sleeve, because we can do this now [Puts the Playing Dangerous 2 sleeve in the Deadliest Prey case] And now...oh no, why did Ted Prior sign our copy of Playing Dangerous 2?
JH: He was very confused
J: Ted Prior, why did you do this?

[40:23] [They go to an indoor shooting range to shoot the Playing Dangerous and Playing Dangerous 2 tapes]
