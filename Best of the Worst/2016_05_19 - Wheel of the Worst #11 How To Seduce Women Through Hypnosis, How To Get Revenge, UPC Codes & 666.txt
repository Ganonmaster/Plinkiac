Mike: Oh, the Plinketto board. That sure worked out great. Picked a bunch of winners there. Maybe randomly selecting VHS tapes is a terrible idea
[Rich walks in pushing the Wheel beside him]
Rich: Hey, Mike! Let’s film a Wheel of the Worst!
M: [Notices something behind the wheel] Oh, what’s this? [Takes out a gun] Oh, thank God! [Points it at his own head]
R: No, Mike, no! There are better ways to kill yourself
M: Oh?
R: Yeah, have you considered, like, a hanging? 
M: But this is instantaneous
R: But what about pills, then?
M: What, like aspirin?
R: Or--or, if you can afford it, maybe heroin
M: Ohh
R: Then you could really go out with a bang then
M: Well this is going out with a bang
R: Ehh yeah, I guess it’s true
M: How would you kill yourself?
R: I mean, it may as well be memorable. Maybe, I could be the guy who jumps off the Freedom Tower
M: Oh…
R: From the very top--
M: Would you wear a postman’s uniform and say “air mail”? [Referencing Double Dragon] Or “9/11 was an inside joooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooob-- [Mike yells “job” for 7 seconds]
R: And then I get hit by the plane, that’s flying into the Freedom Tower. On my way down after I’m committing suicide
M: [Nods] “I guess it wasn’t!!!”

[1:54] M: Well, Rich, we have many new tapes on the Wheel of the Worst, to terrorize and tantalize
R: ...ourselves
M: Yes. Our first video is sponsored by Tyco? It’s Video Driver, “California Chase Road Race.” What is that? Look--it’s like a California license pl--oh, SEGA? You explain, sir
R: I don’t know what the fuck this is. At first I thought that was a Blockbuster video tape
M: It’s SEGA
R: I guess it’s just SEGA and Tyco
M: Is this that little period of time when they had, like, the interactive videos? Like Captain Power, where you shoot your gun at the TV?
R: I don’t have any idea what the fuck this is, and, quite frankly, I don’t care [Turns the wheel] Our next tape is Strong Kids Safe Kids: A Family Guide. Starring Fonzie. He’s doing the Fonzie thing, too. I can’t believe ABC let him get away with him stealing their intellectual property
M: Yeah, that’s true. Uhh, unless he’s doing something else with those thumbs on the kids (???)
R: What? Like what?
M: Uh…
R: I--I cannot--what--I-- [Gives two thumbs up, makes a confused expression]
M: Well--what are you implying with that now?
R: I--
M: I was just implying that he gives them thumbs up
R: Yeah, thumbs up
M: Okay...thumbs up what? [Rich looks lost] Are you some kind of weird sex pervert?
R: Don’t you dare turn this around on me, mister! I turned it around on you first! No backsies!
M: That’s what Henry Winkler said [Turns the wheel] Uh Mr.T’s Be Somebody or Somebody’s Fool
R: Oh, that’s like the thing he says
M: No no no, it’s not an option, it’s--it’s--it’s more like, uh, it’s like an ultimatum. Like, be somebody or be somebody’s fool. I think. Is it--is it both? You can be somebody or be somebody’s fool? (???)
R: It’s like, there’s two kinds of people, people who like spaghetti and people who don’t--it’s just--obviously you’re in one of those two categories
M: I prefer to be somebody’s fool
R: Okay
M: So, I don’t know. I--I’d like to see the segment of the tape about that part
R: Well, I am the expert, I can tell you, it’s no picnic
M: Ok. yeah, I know. Listen, let’s just continue on. So this film, there’s a bunch of children down there as well. So we got two, like, 80s celebrities and kids. So--they’re--they’re stranger danger videos, they’re very similar, actually. But our next film, uh, which I think we had on the board before, and I would prefer that films that were on the board were not on the board again
R: Especially the ones that look like crap
M: Especially the ones that look like crap, somebody put this up here, it’s called BabyVision “your baby’s own video”
R: Nobody gives a shjt. It’s babies. Nobody likes babies
M: Alright. We had this one up here before, someone *really* wants to see it, um, because someone needs to know how to seduce women through hypnosis. Rich, why did you put this up on the board?
R: I did not put this up on the board. You put this up on the board
M: I didn’t touch the board today [Silence] Is Josh around? 
[They look around] 
R: I can’t hear somebody laboriously explaining the plot of How to Seduce Women Through Hypnosis, so I’m gonna say that Josh is not around?
M: Now, we recently watched, uh, Civil War, Captain America Civil War, and you and Jay and I had a challenge of who would bring up Batman vs Superman first, I propose the same challenge, if the wheel lands on this, whoever brings up rape first, gets the buzzer
R:Okay
M: Let’s try to go our entire discussion without saying the R word
R: You just kind of violated that--
M: Well no, I’m explaining the rules, it doesn’t--okay--”How can I get naked real fast--” I’m sorry, “How can I make real friends”
R: Is that how you make friends, you get naked real fast?
M: I thought it said “how can I get naked real fast?” Rich…
R: So you read “Young People Ask” and you read that as “How can I get naked”?
M: No no no, this part, I didn’t see what that--
R: Oh, ok, ok
M: I thought that said “Young People Ass” [Rich laughs] Now, Rich, um, I know you know nothing about how you can make real friends, so [Rich walks away] I won’t ask you to explain that--
R: Our next video is How to Get Revenge, starring Linda Blair
M: Who we should all know as the Exorcist
R: I was gonna jokingly name another movie she was in, but she was in nothing else of note
M: The Exorcist 2
R: Was she in The Exorcist 2? 
M: I don’t know....
R: I haven’t seen The Exorcist 2
M: You have to ask Jay
R: Jay, is Linda Blair in The Exorcist 2? [Camera pans around, showing Jay manning one of the cameras]
Jay: She is
R: She is? Oh, I didn’t know that
M: But--Linda Blair is The Exorcist, so--
R: Well, no, she’s--she’s not the exorcist, the priest is the exorcist, she’s like a possessed girl, she’s not the exorcist. It’s like Frankenstein’s Monster
M: I know. I was waiting for Jay to correct me
R: Oh
J: I’m busy running the camera
M: [Unenthusiastically] Next please...uh, “UPC Codes and 666: Beware the mark of the beast.” Now, this harkens back to an earlier wheel of the worst
R: Did you know we found out after the fact that SOS, that video, was from the Children of God cult? They--they abuse children. They’re the same cult that River Phoenix family came from
M: Oh really?
R: Yes
M: Interesting
R: Yes. So they were horrible, horrible people in real life
M: Oh, that makes a lot of sense. So they made a horrible, horrible video

[8:11] M: That really worked out perfectly for you. I see you redesigned the wheel
R: I am--I--really, where’s that gun? [Walks around] Where is that gun? Where did you put that gun?
M: I’ll be using it later [Walks away]
R: I’m gonna find that gun, you son of a bitch!

[8:54] M: Number one, get her liquored up, number two, nothing

[9:23] M: “Ok, now wake up and fuck me!” [Everybody bursts into laughter]

[9:43] R: Who’da thought this tape woulda been creepy?

[9:50] [At the wheel] R: Well, Jay, let’s watch something that’s something else
J: I think that’s a fabulous idea [Spins the wheel, lands on the hypnosis video again] Oh…
R: Oh fuck
J: Oh [Rich spins the wheel]
R: Yay!
J: How to Get Revenge!
R: Alright, with Linda Blair!
J: How serious is this video going to be?
R: I th--
J: Is it gonna be a serious attempt to explain how to get revenge on people?
R: Wouldn’t that be fantastic? What else could it be?
J: A joke video? Do you remember Leslie Nielsen’s golf videos? That wasn’t how to really play golf
R: Are you thinking of Tim Conway’s golf videos?
J: No, Leslie Nielsen did the poor man’s Tim Conway golf videos
R: Oh my god
J: Yeah...So is this the poor man’s Tim Conway’s Leslie Nielsen’s how-to video?
R: I don’t know, but I’m sure this video will turn heads
J: Alright, let’s go! [Leaves]
[Rich walks into one of the cameras, setting off a chain reaction of chaos; one of the cameras chases after Rich; The Exorcist theme plays] (???)
J: How did all this happen from Rich just running into a camera?

[12:38] Man: Now, if your mark is a member of the minority, you might turn him over to the immigration service
[Jay put his hands on the back of his head, Mike and Rich cover their mouths]
JK: I’m sorry, what?
M: A member of the minority. Everyone who’s a minority is here illegally
JK: That one minority

[13:11] M: This is more upsetting than the rape video

[13:14] M: Jack
JK: Mike
M: It’s time for you to spin the wheel. You better land on something good, ‘cause I’ve just learned plenty of ways to get revenge on you. Gonna hypnotize and rape you. I really didn’t learn anything from the last tape

[13:36] [Lands on UPC Codes & 666] JK: Boom!
M: UPC Codes 666
JK: Yes!
M: “Beware the ‘mark’ ”--[points to the revenge tape] Let’s see, does this have a UPC code on it? [Removes the tape cover] 
JK: It doe--well, oh--that’s-- 
M: That’s an explanation of what it means, it does not have a UPC code
JK: That would be very ironic
M: That would be very hypocritical [Jack grabs the cover and throws in on the ground] Let’s go 
[Jack leaves, Mike slides the wheel in the opposite direction] 
JK: Mike, over here
M: It’s caught on me
JK: I don’t--I don’t believe you

[14:38] M: Okay, I believe in Satan
JK: Oh!
J: Yeah, sure

[14:55] Man: Before going any further, let’s be clear on one central point
J: “I’m nuts”

[15:09] R: Wait, are you gonna climb on top of me (???) or are you just talking about the video?
M: Well
JK: We’re gonna climb on top of the videos 
J: So we watched 3 videos, and I’m going to introduce them, so I don’t have to explain any of them
JK: Bitch
J: The first tape, that we watched, was How To Seduce Women Through Hypnosis…….who wants that one? I don’t even know...who I’m gonna torture with this, um….[Picks up the tape]
[Nobody speaks]
M: It’s clearly gonna be Rich [Jack laughs, Jay puts the tape in front of Mike] Oh shit, I just doomed myself
J: You doomed yourself. I was going to give it to Rich, but….
M: Okay. How To Seduce Women Through Hypnosis--[Indicates the people on the cover] There is a nude man, and a lingeried-up lady 
J: She’s has more clothes on than he does
M: Yeah, um--
JK: It’s very progressive
[Overlapping dialogue]
J:--I would describe this tape as
M: It is the woman who appears on the tape, who we will call Eyebrows, but it’s not the man, I think this is her dream man
J: Can we just call her Eugene Levy?
M: Eugenia Levy
J: Eugenia Levy
M: Uhh but that is not the man who hypnotizes and rapes her in the film
J: No. Wait! You already fucked up!
JK: You lose already
M: You know, I think talking about this film and not using the word rape is nearly impossible
J: Not nearly, it’s completely impossible
M: I’m throwing the rulebook out the window

[17:15] [The woman is in the middle of the street, reading, while a guy on a motorcycle drives around her in circles]

[19:08] M: We gotta look this guy up. Find out why he’s in jail now

[20:42] Man: Notice how John immediately establishes credibility
J: “Trick them into thinking you’re a normal everyday person”
M: “You just don’t want sex. You ought to know about the woman”
JK: But like--he--he appeared credible by saying he’s a hypnotist?

[21:11] Eyebrows: Wow, I always wanted to be hypnotized
[Rich suddenly starts cackling/screeching, Jay covers his eyes]
M: Well, that’s our winner right there
[21:30] M: The twist at the end of this was like a M. Night Shyamalan film. It had a big twist. I was not expecting them to go full-on rape. It was weird
J: It’s not rape, Mike, there’s plenty of warnings at the front of the video to let you know that this is not rape

[21:22] JK: Oh, and don’t forget, when you take your, uh, partner, not your victim, not your mark, when you take your partner home, to unplug her phone
J: Oh, yes
JK: ‘Cause you don’t want distractions or her calling for help, or anything like that, I mean, weird

[23:06] M: Whereas, he calls them “in-her-endos”

[23:43] JK: Stop rubbing your mom jeans!

[23:58] [Guy starts to make a move on the hypnotized woman, everybody starts yelling “no!” and panicking]
(...)
M: This is about rape!

[24:37] M: Like, like, you can make a video, like, how to pick up a woman in a bar or whatever, like...buy her a drink, talk to her--
J: Much easier than this shit

[26:57] JK: Edited by Mike Hunt!
M: What, for real?!

[27:08] M: Is there anything else to say? Rich? [Rich has stayed silent throughout most of the discussion; he is smiling without humor] Couple of weeks ago, you invited me over, and you said “get comfortable, lay down on my bed, and I’m gonna start talking” and you started talking about the ocean waves, and then you went like this…
JK: Rich is a good friend, so you trust him
M: And the next thing, I woke up...in a compromising situation, that’s all I’ll say. And ever since then--
[Camera focuses on Rich]
LB: Now let me ask you a question, at some time in your life, has someone ever made you so angry, so upset, that you considered some form of retribution, some form of revenge?

[27:54] J: So our next tape, that we watched...uh...may be the most baffling thing that we’ve watched on Wheel of the Worst? We’ve watched more offensive things, we’ve watched weirder things, but this is the most, like, “why is this something that exists?” How to Get Revenge, hosted by Linda Blair
JK: And Linda Blair, everyone knows is famous from The Exorcist. She’s the little girl in The Exorcist
J: [Stammers] Mostly known for The Exorcist
JK: She’s also really known for…
J: The Exorcist
JK: But like, her other big movie role
J: Well, she goes to a lot of conventions, because of her role in The Exorcist 
M: Does she have an eating disorder? Or I just associate her with throwing up pea soup?
J: I mean, it’s entirely possible. Now she dedicates a lot of her time to--to animal rescue, and she’s….causes, she’s--yeah, she’s big into that stuff
R: Do people still care what she has to say?

[29:42] R: Not like, not like joke--not like I’m gonna put a little fart bag on your chair and you sit down--
J: Whoopee cushion
M: Whoopee cushion
J: Not fart bags
R: This is--
J: Are fart bags the off-brand version of a whoopee cushion?

[33:35] Man: My former boss fired me for no damn reason whatsoever
[Everyone laughs] M: I’m sure there is a reason, sir

[35:48] R: I’ve got--I’ve got news for you, there’s no reason why any of these have to be “for revenge.” Anybody can do any of these things just to be a dick
[37:18] Mr. Vickers: I had this client, whose best friend came to him, and talked him into investing in a “real eskate” scam
All: A real eskate scam?
R: Dad???

[37:51] Mr. Vickers: Yet, there are, just a few, who feel a great need to stress their “superie order” over decent--
M: This guy’s drunk. I think he’s drunk

[39:35] JK: This is one of the most terrifying images
M: Yeah
J: Yeah, it’s not pixelated enough

[40:02] M: It looks like, uh, uh, Christopher Lloyd at the end of Roger Rabbit
JK: It’s really beautifully creepy

[40:14] J: His face wasn’t pixelated when it did the dissolve, did you see that?
JK: No
J: It was like they couldn’t do two effects at once
M: So, uh, detective...we know who you are...we’re posting your image here for the internet to see [“Have you seen this man???” appears under his picture] 
J: We’re gonna send 15 pizzas to your house
M: And then….ruin your marriage. So your wife commits suicide [Jay laughs] Isn’t that funny? 
JK: Also, I’ve already filed your fake death certificate, good luck getting social security now that you’re aged (???) [Laughs evilly]
M: [Chuckles] Also--
R: Took your credit card out in your name, and I just bought a house
M: Yeah
JK: Have fun with crippling debt! Hahahahahaha!
M: And Rich put a bunch of *bleep* on your *bleep* [“Too hot for TV” covers Mike’s mouth during the bleeps]
J: Ohh!!
R: [Throws the tape on the ground again] For fucks sake! 
M: What? It was just a simple transfer through Dropbox
LB: Revenge is a natural emotion

[41:14] M: Ohh, he cheated on you!
Woman: And then Victoria came along
M: [Lying down sideways on the sofa, hugging a cushion] I knew it!

[41:32] M: This is like a drug video. Like this lady seems like a crack addict

[41:46] JK: “So we gave them all syphilis”
(...)
M: Can you be drunker?
Mr. Vickers: The letters stated that Victoria had been to the free clinic and had tested positive for syphilis
M: Oh my god!!! 
JK: It’s fucking syphilis!! [Jumps over the couch]
J: Seriously?!
M: It’s syphilis! [Lifts the footrest]
JK: It’s syphilis! Fuuuuuck!
[Jack and Mike get up and cheer; they lift the couch]
R: Woah, woah, woah, I had a drink on there, it fell all over the floor

[43:19] [Jack mentions SOS, Mike and the rest start humming it and waving their arms]
J: That song is so catchy, it’s a shame that the people that made it are child molesters

[45:03] R: [Points at the TV] 21!
[Everybody is quiet for a second, then Jay and Jack laugh]
JK: You did it, Rich. You cracked the code

[45:28] [Jack takes out a blu-ray of Space Cop to show off the bar code, they just end up promoting/advertising for it]

[48:33] JK: Also, surprisingly edited by my cunt. Not by--uh, credited and certified editor Mike Hunt, it was edited, literally, by my cunt
J: Ohh
M: Oh. Oh! You were a lady this whole time?
JK: Didn’t you guys know?
M: I didn’t--I didn’t know…
JK: Oh! Yeah
J: I never thought to ask
M: I mean, I didn’t think you were a *man*…
JK: Right
R: You’re a lady??? [Covers his mouth] I can’t believe I had sex with you!
M: Oh my god!
JK: Wait a minute, that hypnotism session wasn’t just a friendly meeting?
[Rich pretends to flee, but he knocks over a bottle and sits back down]
J: Oh noooo 
M: Guys, guys--[Jack immediately stops laughing]--I always knew the “Rec” in “Pre-Rec” stood for “rectum” [Jay laughs]
JK: Damn you…
M: I always knew
R: You know that’s gonna stick around, too, that one [Jay laughs even louder]
JK: Oh, yeah, don’t put that one in 
M: You put it right in there. You walked right into it. You slid it right in…..You lubed it up and slid it right in, Rich. You just, you put it right in my hands and said “put it right in my--”

[49:41] Man: Deception. Miracles
JK: Male pattern baldness 
M: We can help you with all these problems

[51:04] J: What’s he gonna do? What’s he gonna do when I buy my copy--when I go to the store and I buy my copy of How To Seduce Women Through Hypnosis, what--what is the devil gonna do?
M: [Chuckles] At that point, you’re fucked anyway

[51:26] J: So I’m gonna go to Hell for buying some rice krispies? 
JK: Abso-fucking-lutely
R: God is a prick
J: You’re going to Hell for so many more reasons than buying rice krispy treats, so don’t worry about you going to Hell

[52:35] R: I hope they put it in the right hand and the forehead, just to fuck with the fundies
[Mike gives Rich some looks and squints] 
R: What? You’re not a fundie!
M: [Mild-mannered] Yeah I am, I--I’m into the Jesus
JK: You didn’t know that about Mike? That’s where we met
R: Did you meet--like, find Jesus yesterday?
M: Yeah, yeah, I found him, me and Jack met at church
JK: Met at church. Found him--you know--he was in the back room
R: Did an Antichrist show up and they had to fight? ‘Cause it’s like they’re bad guys and good guys? Antichrist is such a weird name to me--
J: Yeah
R: It sounds like a supervillain
J: Hmm-hmm
R: The evil inverse of Jesus
M: In the original Hebrew, “Antichrist” meant shitty Jesus
JK: Which didn’t mean he was bad, he was just a normal guy who couldn’t do anything--
M: Like Jesus, just shitty
JK: Like Jesus, but he didn’t have any magic powers, so you know, like a shitty Jesus
R: That’s just Jesús
JK: Yeah
M: And he was so pissed at Jesus, he wrote a letter to the IRS saying that Jesus was dead
J: Oh yeah, yeah
JK: And that’s where the 3 Day Miracle came from. Actually, historical, uh...
M: ‘Cause Jesus wrote a counter-letter to the IRS saying he had risen
JK: But it took 3 days to--
M: It was after he died
JK: It took 3 days of postage to get--
J: Oh, sure, sure!
M: Hence, religion
R: So it’s just a clerical error?
M: It was a clerical error by the IRS, which created Our Lord and Saviour 

[54:10] M: Yeah, ok………………..This is so dumb I can’t even formulate a sentence

[54:34] M: And I’m just gonna go ahead and say my choice for destruction--[Indicates the hypnosis video] this needs to be wiped off the face of the Earth 

[55:56] J: Rich?
R: Uhh, well this--[Indicates the UPC Codes tape]--is some good old-fashioned...Christian values right there...Some nice fear-mongering. “We’re all gonna die soon.” That’s interesting
J: [Chuckling] “That’s interesting…”
R: [Taps How to Get Revenge] This is kind of great [Jack and Jay burst into laughter] I--I--I love the fact there--there is a video tape with information on how to destroy people’s lives
JK: Yup
R: So this is my best of the worst. But yeah, I--let’s destroy the rape tape [Mike and Jay crack up]

[56:53] M: It’s--it’s unanimous, we…[Picks up the hypnosis tape] this is the most worthy tape to destroy. No weird old man with beard needs to watch this and get any funky ideas. ‘Cause there are far too many unsuspecting ladies out there that need to be protected, by the likes of us. Just in case, some weird man watches this, how--remote possibility (?), we need to destroy this. 
JK: Absolutely
J: Yes
M: Also, ladies, trim your eyebrows
