[Jack shows off their collection of Nukie tapes sitting on a shelf]
Jack: Alllright, it’s finally time! We’re gonna watch--[Dejected] dinosaur movies [Stares at the ground]
[Jay walks in carrying tapes]
Jay: Hey Jack! Do you, uh, do you remember the 90s? [Tape falls on the ground]
JK: [Sings “Semi-Charmed Life”] Yeah, I do
J: Mo--more specifically, do you remember Jurassic Park?
JK: Oh, Jurassic Park’s a great one
J: Jurassic Park’s a great movie, right? I’m gonna say Jurassic Park is the worst thing to ever happen to dinosaurs. And that includes when they all died [Jack laughs] Because, in the wake of Jurassic Park, there was a renewed interest in dinosaurs
JK: Hmm-hmm
J: And we have all these dinosaur movies, Jack
JK: Dinosaur movies!
J: I mean, there was this--[Holds up a copy of Prehysteria 2]--three Prehysteria movies 
JK: Ooh!
J: [Drops the tape, holds up the next one] Adventures in Dinosaur City….
JK: That sounds awesome, a whole city made of…[Jay holds up a copy of Super Mario Bros] [Quietly] Shh-shhhh
J: And of course, who could forget Dennis the Menace: Dinosaur Hunter?
JK: [Takes the tape and looks at it] Are we gonna watch this?
J: We’re not watching that one--
JK: Oh--[Drops the tape, the camera focuses on the fallen tapes]
J: So we’re not gonna watch those movies, maybe we’ll save some of ‘em for another day, I don’t know, but we do have three...shitty 90s dinosaur movies
*Movie #1 Theodore Rex (1995)*
JK: Our first movie is Theodore Rex, starring Whoopi Goldberg--[Points her out on the cover]--and John Goodman! [Points to the dinosaur] Well, let’s see what this movie’s about [Jay laughs] “The world’s toughest cop is getting a brand new partner, and he’s a real blast from the past!” [Pause] ‘Cause he’s a dinosaur
J: ‘Cause he’s a--I get the--yeah
JK: Ok. “Academy Award-winner Whoopi Goldberg…”
J: Oh man
JK: “...is the perfect comic partner in this hilarious futuristic family comedy about a cop, and a dinosaur, on a mission to save the world”
J: Do you think she ever made an attempt to get them to take off the “Academy Award-winner” part?
JK: Yes! Yes I’m sure, I’m sure she--she said “don’t--no one’s gonna…”
J: She won an Academy Award for Ghost, right? How long after her Academy Award for Ghost was this movie made? 
JK: Well this was 1995
J: Ok
JK: So 5 years after winning an Academy Award
J: That’s all…? That’s all it takes, huh?
JK: Well, “Whoopi, star--”[Laughs]--Sorry, I--
J: Look at Cuba Gooding Jr, after he won that Academy Award, nothing but dinosaur movies
JK: Absolutely! He was on the ship movie with dinosaurs [Cover of Boat Trip appears with a dinosaur wearing a hoodie photoshopped in] 
J: I know he was in that one where he trained dinosaurs--[Cover of Snow Dogs appears with dinosaurs instead of huskies]--to--to drive a sled
JK: Yeah. That was a good one. [Continues reading] Uh, “Whoopi...stars as a smooth-talking, take-care-of-business cop on the rise, but when she teams up on a high-profile case with a tyrannosaurus rex named Teddy…” I like how the back is just like, “this is what--what happens”
JK: Well, what can you do? This is what happens in the movie, you can’t get around that
JK: “Everyw--”
J: They’re not gonna try and pass it off as something else
JK: [Laughs] Uh, “she’s on a high-profile case with a tyrannosaurus rex named Teddy. She blows her cool….” what? Sorry, I’m gonna take this whole sentence over again
J: Please don’t
JK: “But when she teams up on a high-profile case with a tyrannosaurus rex named Teddy, she blows her cool. The bumbling, three-toed dinosaur can’t even find his own tail, much less a clue!” Hahaha!
J: Oh no….
JK: Yeah, it’s gonna be wacky 
J: [Puts a hand on his forehead] Oh no, dinosaur slapstick?
JK: Hmm-hmm
J: Okay…
JK: Awkward rubber puppet suit dinosaur slapstick, this is gonna be the best! 

[3:32] [In the screening room]
Rich: Err--now do all tyrannosaurus rexes have the last name “Rex”? [Jay laughs] Or is that just a--a--a--a horrible coincidence?

[3:46] Whoopi Goldberg: He’s a dinosaur!
Guy: You’re not a specist, are you?
JK: Ahhhh
Josh: Oh he did! (?)
[Silence]
JK: That--oh--that made Rich really upset (?) [Everyone laughs] Rich, how do you feel about ham-fisted social commentary?
R: [Raises his glass] I hate it!
JK: Alright!

[4:12] R: Was Whoopi Goldberg comfortable with doing this? 
JK: I think...
R: “We’re gonna make a movie where you’re playing a racist!”
[Jay and Jack laugh loudly]
JH: Was she--was she dating Ted Danson--[Picture appears of Ted Danson in blackface]--at this point? 

[4:27] J: Alright, Jack, our next film is Carnosaur, produced by Roger Corman
*Movie #2 Carnosaur (1993)*
J: Slapped together quickly to capitalize on the--the recent success of Jurassic Park
JK: Sure, the--the velociraptor craze…
J: Yes, yes
JK:...of the mid 90s
J: And this film also stars Diane Ladd, who is, uh, Laura Dern’s mom...in real life. Laura Dern was, of course, in Jurassic Park
[Jack scratches his head, background music stops]
JK: Who’s Laura Dern?
J: She’s in Wild at Heart, she’s in tons of stuff--[Jack looks at the camera]--She’s a great actress, don’t--everyone knows who Laura Dern is except for you
R: [Off screen] [Slowly] I know who Laura Dern is!
JK: Shut up, Rich! [They both laugh] So--
JH: Dang
J: The interesting thing about this is that it was given a thumbs up by Gene Siskel, this may be the first Gene Siskel-approved movie we’ve watched on Best of the Worst
JK: Oh my god
J: Or critic-approved in any way, actually, but, uh--
JK: Well, Cor--Corman usually makes...at least competent movies, even though they’re hilariously under budget 
J: Yes
JK: So we’ll see what he can do with a--is it a full-sized dinosaur or is it--
J: Well, if you look on the back here, you can see it attacking a Bobcat
JK: Oh god…
J: With someone--someone awkwardly photoshopped into the--the Bobcat. [Looks at the case] Ah uhh--”the great bestseller becomes the motion picture event of the year!”
JK: A--a book?
J: But they don’t say they’re talking about Carnosaur, so they may be talking about Jurassic Park [Jack laughs and claps] I don’t know. “From chicken eggs, a deranged geneticist, (Diane Ladd) uh, brings dinosaurs back to life!” [Silence] I don’t ge--hopefully, the movie explains how that happens from chicken eggs
JK: [Shakes his head] I--I predict no science
J: Ok
JK: In this movie
J: They’ll just say “thanks to science, these chicken eggs now produced dinosaurs!”
JK: Yup
J: And that’ll be the extent of it
JK: Ok
J: “A brilliant discovery, till she turns the carnivores loose on a quiet town. They breathe like rats. They prey like the plague. It’s man against the most vicious beasts of all! Uh, and neither will survive while the other is alive”
JK: O--Oh my
J: So this is the exact opposite of the--the back of the Theodore Rex box, where they’re really underselling the movie. I picture the guy typing this up, just bored
JK: Yup
J: They’re--I--I’m predicting there’s gonna be one dinosaur in this whole movie
JK: You think?
J: I have a feeling

[6:52] [A small dinosaur is attacking a couple, blood is splattering everywhere]
R: Look at it--look at it, it’s cute! 
JK: AHAHAHAHA
R: It’s cute!!!!
(...)
[After the attack is over]
All: Awww
JK: It’s great!
JH: (?)
Guy: Help me!!!!
R: It’s like a killer Muppet

[7:34] J: Jack, what are we gonna watch now?
JK: Tammy and the T-Rex!
*Movie #3 Tammy and the T-Rex (1994)*
J: Jack, what happens in Tammy and the T-Rex?
JK: Tammy….
J:  Who’s in Tammy and the T-Rex?
JK: Terry Kiser!
J: From the Weekend at Bernie’s movies
JK: He’s Bernie?
J: He’s Bernie
JK: Oh my god, Denise Richards, from 007 James Bond
J: [Chuckles] She played--didn’t she play a nuclear scientist in that movie?
JK: She did!
J: Named something Christmas?
JH: [In the background] Christmas Jones
J: Christmas Jones!
JK: Yes!
J: I was gonna say Lloyd Christmas, but that’s a completely different movie
JK: [Flips the tape over] Tammy and the T-Rex. “What do you do when you wake up and discover you’ve become a tyrannosaurus re--” what?! [Jay laughs] Is that really what this movie is about? “When you wake up and discover you’ve become a tyrannosaurus rex?”
J: I hate when that happens!
JK: This is great!
J: Aight 
JK: [Continues reading] “Yesterday, all Michael (Paul Walker) thought about was getting a date with Tammy (Denise Richards). Today, he has to be careful not to flatten the town just by walking through it! Buuut his biggest problem is hiding his three-ton prehistoric body from a mad scientist…”
J: I thought that was going in a completely different direction
JK: His three-ton--(?) Umm “hiding his three-ton prehistoric body from a mad scientist (Terry Kiser), who wants to make him extinct...permanently” I d--did want to mention though, that like, “extinct permanently” is kind of, uhh…
J: Redundant?
JK: Redundant! That’s a way better word
J: Yeah. Once you’re extinct, you’re extinct
JK: Once you’re extinct, it’s kind of permanent, that’s--
J: Yeah
JK: (?)
J: “I’m gonna kill you to death!” It kind of sounds like that
JK: That’s a good one. I like that one. Uhhmmm “get set for a wild adventure! With the most unlikely couple you’ll ever meet, Tammy and the T-Rex”
J: Hmm….
JK: [Points to a picture on the back] Oh my god, she’s like in love with the dinosaur [Jay laughs]

[10:19] [At the table]
[Everybody’s depressed-looking and staring downward, Rich sighs, nobody speaks]
J: Dinosaurs!
R: [Weakly] Uhhh
JH: No
J: Normally, this is the point where we say, “hey! We watched three movies, the first one we watched was Theodore Rex, and then someone explains the plot of Theodore Rex...in this case I’m gonna say...does anyone remember what happened in Theodore Rex?
R: I could--I could take a stab at it
J: Alright, it’s all yours
R: Umm, it takes place--
J: It’s all yours
JH: And yes, enlighten me please
R: It takes place on a world where an eco-friendly geneticist has reintroduced humanoid dinosaurs into the world, and they--they live in harmony and racism, except that’s not enough, he also wants to kill all life on the planet…
JK: They live in harmony AND racism?
R: In harmony and racism [Jay laughs]
JH: It’s a delicate balance, Jack
J: Yeah, yeah
R: Yeah, and he--he wants to kill all life, even though he introduced the dinos--he went through all the trouble of introducing the dinosaurs back in the world so he could kill off the dinosaurs and the humans, so he could control the future evolution...of the planet
J: Yeah
JK: That’s really…
R: That’s--a--and Theodore Rex and Whoopi Goldberg team up 

[11:40] J: It’s a buddy cop movie
R: They team up to go to funerals and, and, and like go to a bar and talk to some kids who were playing hockey, and then eventually they crash a helicopter--
J: Wait, wait, wait, the kids are not at the bar playing hockey
R: They’re--they might be
J: The way you said that made it sound like they went to a bar to hang out with kids playing hockey
JH: I’d go to *that* bar
J: Those are--those are two separate incidents
R: See, that--that would’ve been far more interesting
J: That’s true
JK: The--the child labour hockey bar?
R: Yeah
JK: Yeah, ok, alright
R: Yeah
J: It’s a big thing in the future

[12:13] [Whoopi Goldberg laughs with a dinosaur at a bar]
JH: Outtake!
J: Yeah, this is Whoopi Goldberg realizing what she’s gotten herself into

[12:20] JK: It is a detective story
J: Yes, technically
JK: And so, by the filmmakers making the story so incoherent, *we* get to be the detectives trying to piece together what is happening in front of our eyes, it makes perfect sense
R: The--the--the first clue? Or lack of a clue, is the opening text crawl, right?
Narrator: Once upon a time in the future...
R: The purpose of the opening text crawl is to establish your world, you’ve got like a really complicated world and people won’t know what’s going on, so you might want the text to say “and then dinosaurs were created and spliced with human ge--DNA and then they’ve become citizens of the world,” but the opening text of Theodore Rex, it explains everything that the bad guy’s going to do! So the--
J: In the opening scene of the movie
R: In the op--yes
J: It explains what’s going to happen in the first scene 
Narrator: One hour ago, two workers escaped from the New Eden compound and are racing to tell the police about Kane’s Master Plan...
J: They’re being very specific about what--let’s get to it
JH(?): That’s a lot of plot
J: Show them doing it
[At the table]
JK: Do you think there’s an example of like a good text crawl in a sci-fi movie that--that helps explain things? [Star Wars logo slowly fades in then disappears]
R: I can’t possibly think of one
J: But we don’t know about dinosaurs, and then just, a dinosaur wakes up from a dream, and that’s Teddy Rex
JK: Yes
J: And we’re like, “ok, dinosaurs?? Why???” and we don’t know, for the longest time
JK: We still don’t know!
[Theodore Rex removes some shoes from a drawer]
JH: Why does he keep his shoes in a drawer? Is he supposed to be a quirky dinosaur?
Teddy: (?) toothbrush action
JK: He’s a sad dinosaur, he talks to himself

[14:34] JK: I don’t know if it can be said enough….we have no idea why dinosaurs are in this world
J: No!
JK:  And...
J: Other than the fact that they wanted to make a movie with dinosaurs in it
JH: Well, they make a little kind of hint at that early on in the movie, where they’re saying, oh we’re gonna--you know, they’re--they’re about ready to clone raccoons and bring them back from extinction...why did they do dinosaurs first?
J: Why did they---
R: Why would you NOT?!
JH: Because it’s unpredictable, Rich. Bring raccoons back and see how *that* works...they’re just gonna walk around and eat your garbage, you’ll--you’ll get *that*
R: [Waving his hand] I’ve seen Jurassic Park, everything will work out fine!

[15:20] [In the screening room]
JK: Also, he’s a psychic dinosaur
[At the table]
JK: So, the drea--the thing that happened in black and white at the beginning of the movie, there was a butterfly that landed on a dinosaur’s nose, but that butterfly was actually a robot exploding butterfly. Which is a real sentence that makes sense in this movie!
R: And--and this really happened because as Theodore Rex explained...all dinosaurs are mildly psychic when it comes to other dinosaurs
JH: I’m really glad he went back to pick up that plot detail, because the movie wouldn’t make a lick of sense without it
JK: Also, I don’t want to brush over what Rich Evans has just said

[17:07] JH: I mean, she’s got some, uh, wacky banter with her previous partner
[Silence]
J: Oh, God! Yeah [Puts his palm on his forehead]
[Josh and Rich laugh]
WG: I thought you said you had the front
Partner: I thought you said you had the back!
WG: Oh, like you had the front?
P: Like you had the back! [A truck explodes]
JH: Thank God something ended *that* scene
J: Yeah
JK: That was just too much witty dialogue, as far as I’m concerned
[At the table]
J: I think Shane Black did some rewrites on this thing
JH: Yeah. He did such a good job that a truck explodes to stop them talking [Jay laughs, then Rich]
R: That’s the screenwriter saying “we have to stop this banter immediately!”
JH: There’s no way out of it!
R: “Abort! Abort!”

[18:19] JK: I can’t believe this is real….

[19:18] J: Oh, he farted...
R: I was waiting for the fart joke! And it finally happened!
J: Was it everything you hoped for, Rich?
R: It was everything and more!

[22:15] Whoopi Goldberg’s dying words: Your brain...use...your brain…
JK: When has he used his brain for anything in this movie?!
[Jay laughs loudly, Josh gets up and leaves and flips off the tv, Rich throws his balled-up jacket at the TV]

[23:07] JK: His dumb, lumbering tail busts his girlfriend out of jail so literally, brute force wins, fuck your mind (?) That’s the moral of the story
JH: His tail has more of a character arc than he does

[23:55] JK: I wanna die!
J: So our next film...is Carnosaur

[27:39] R: Whenever there’s a dinosaur on the screen…
JK: Yeah
R: I’m happy. I’m very happy

[27:54] R: Josh 
JH: Yeah
R: You--you--you go to work, and there’s a whole bunch of people there, that have been mauled by wild animals. What do you do?
JH: Call the fucking cops
R: No!
JH: I don’t?
R: No! You go to the local genetic research place, dressed as a security guard--[Jay and Jack laugh]--with a gun

[30:53] JH: This movie is so fucking weird!
[At the table]
JH: Diane Ladd dies because she has, a--a--a dinosaur squirt out of her stomach like Alien style
JK: Not just squirt out--
J: She gives herself a--a--a c-section with her fingers
JH: Yeah
JK: THAT’S AWESOME!! She ripped open her own belly to birth a dinosaur!

[33:15] JH: Who was it that did the effects?
J: Oh, it was John Buechler, who’s responsible for the troll in Troll, and the ghoulies in Ghoulies

[35:25] [Paul Walker’s character is getting mauled by a lion, R.I.P. PAUL WALKER appears on screen] 

[48:15] [Denise Richards opens a coffin with a rotting corpse filled with maggots inside of it, R.I.P. PAUL WALKER appears again]

[49:12] JK: I’m really--I’m really kind of torn on this, here’s what, I--I will start with what is definitely not best of the worst, which is Carnosaur [Jay and Josh look surprised] I thought Carnosaur was a little too good [Jay and Rich laugh]
J: You’re the first person in the history of the world to say that
JK: Me and Gene Siskel, we--[Everyone laughs]
R: Ge--Gene Siskel had a good laugh after giving *that* a thumbs up [More laughter] He’s like...
J: He’s like “thumbs up!” [Blows raspberry]
R: “Fuck it, I’m dying. Thumbs up!”

[49:45] JK: For my pick, the best of the worst, is Theodore Rex
J: Oh my god, fuck you
R: Yeah. Fuck him
JK: It is the movie that I would love other people to see so they can feel my pain
R: Jack, you’re--you’re such a hipster that even in our small group, even in our tiny little group, you just have to be the dissenting opinion
JK: No, no, no, no, no, because...the uh--I was most engaged with Theodore Rex, I had no idea what was happening at all times, and I pay attention--[Rich turns to Jay and jerks a thumb towards Jack]--to movies far more than anyone else. No other movie has made me feel as much as Theodore Rex. The feeling was pain, but it has awoken parts of my brain and then killed off those parts...it--it--it--it’s--
J: I can’t even begin to understand what the hell you’re trying to say right now. I really can’t

[51:23] J: Tammy and the T-Rex...is so weird, and so dumb...I think I said it while we were watching the movie, is--is this the dumbest thing we’ve ever watched? And I think we came to the consensus that Robo-CHIC was dumber
JH: But not by much!

[52:28] [After Josh explains why he chose Carnosaur as best of the worst]
J: See, your--your decision for Carnosaur...I understand…[Looks at Jack, Jack looks around, refusing to make eye contact, Rich laughs] 

[52:48] J: Umm, who wants to burn this fuckin’ thing?
JH: I wanna make it die
JK: No!
J: Who wants to kill Theodore Rex?
JK: No!
J: Raise your hand [Everyone but Jack raises their hand]
JK: NO!!! [Jay gives the middle finger to Jack] You can’t kill Theodore Rex, it’s a masterpiece!
JH: You know what, I don’t just  want to kill it once, I wanna kill it twice

[53:11] [Rich puts VHS and DVD copies of Theodore Rex on a driveway outside the warehouse, a car runs over both of them at the same time] (?)
