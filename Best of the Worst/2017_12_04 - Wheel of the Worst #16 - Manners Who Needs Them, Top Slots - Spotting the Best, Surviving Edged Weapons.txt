Mike: Oh hey Josh, what are you doing?
Josh: Oh hey, I’m here because it’s time for another Best of the Worst! And I’m here to pick out some movies
[Silence]
M: Ohhh no [Record scratch] Oh no, no, no, no...no, no, no...no--ho--ho, no--ho--no, no, no, no...[Josh drops the tape]...no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you misunderstood [Josh whimpers(?)] Oh no, no, no--ho, no, no, no, no--ho--ho, no, no, no, no, no…[Josh whimpers] No--ho--ho, no, no--[Josh starts weeping]--no, no, no, no, no, no! I think you know what I mean
JH: [Recovers quickly, speaks normally] I think so
[Intro plays] 
[Mike and Josh stand by the Wheel of Misfortune in the warehouse]
[Mike drinks from his bottle]
M: Ugh…[Burps] Show some enthusiasm! For Christ’s sake, we’re here to spin the Wheel of the Worst!
JH: [Sadly] Why?
M: Random VHS tapes!....That are probably terrible, that we’re going to watch
JH: Oh
M: And then discuss, what else could you possibly want to do with your evening? [Josh exhales] What’s the first film featured on the Wheel of the Worst?
JH: Today’s first film is called “The Shocking Truth! What you should know about electrical safety running time: 18 minutes...A presentation by COM/Electric.”
M: Okay!
JH: Sounds like some conspiracy theories
M: “The shocking truth” could be about anything from Louis CK to Charlie Rose. Now let’s move on…[Turns the Wheel] Our second film is called Lights, Camera, Bubbles! I have a feeling this was on the Wheel of the Worst at some point
JH: I recognize this
M: Didn’t we even watch it?
JH: I don’t...remember that 
M: Oh...
JH: [Turns the Wheel] Next is “When Mom + Dad Break Up, hosted by Alan Thicke.” I can finally find out what happened in my early childhood
M: This font and the text look very similar to Mr. Mom, doesn’t it?
JH: Yes
M: Makes me think of that
JH: Yes
M: ...were released around the same time
JH: I’m actually watching Mr. Mom tomorrow night
M: That’s the strangest thing that anyone’s ever said to me 
JH: [Laughs] It’s understandable [Turns the Wheel]
M: Uh…”Casino Journal Publishing Group,” the CJPG
JH: Hmm
M: An esteemed organization
JH: Certainly
M: Uhh, “presents: Top Slots - Spotting...the Best.” Oh! “Top Slots. Spotting the Best”
JH: Ah!
M: Shouldn’t that be a semicolon?
JH: Yeah, yeah
M: Dash is a little distracting
JH: But it’s also formatted really badly
M: Yeah, it’s--it’s, yeah….
JH: Very confusing
M: There’s a lot going on that’s wrong there. “Hosted by Jimmy ‘The Scot’ Jordan”.....Sounds like a mobster to me
JH: I don’t know how I feel about that….Next up after that…[Turns the Wheel] Young People Ask: How Can I Make Real Friends?....[Looks at the camera] Pay attention, internet!
M: It should be called “People Who Play Video Games: How Can I Make Real Friends?” you know what I’m saying? [They chuckle]
JH: Oh…
[Silence]
[Mike rubs his forehead, Rich laughs in the background]
M: [Turns the Wheel] High Impact: Fucklift Safety
JH: Oh! No, Mike, that--our next tape…[Mike tries downing his bottle] is...uh…“Dog Lovers Care Guides presents Emergency First Aid, an introductory course,” and look at the adorable pupper
M: Awwww
JH: Gonna help that pupper, uh, if they’re choking or something
M: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
JH: What’s next?
M: Oh! Next...uh….well...most...irrelevant video I think we’ve ever seen on the Wheel! The Y2K Family Survival Guide hosted by Leonard Nimoy
JH: Wow. Remember when Leonard Nimoy helped us all through the Y2K disaster?
M: I did, I did, yeah
JH: It was a--it was a--it was a beautiful time
M: Who better to help you through a potential computer apocalypse than Mr. Spock?
JH: Next up on the Wheel...Athletes For Abstinence: It Ain’t Worth...It!
M: Maybe Athletes For Abstinence is athletes saying you should abstain from playing sports
JH: Ooh!
M: Because you’re gonna get a fucking brain damage
JH: [Exhales] Geez…
M: “Oh no! Don’t go in the NFL, it ain’t worth it!”
JH: Hmm-mhm, hmm, “don’t horn in on my actions,” what they’re saying
M: Come out bankrupt and your brain won’t work. “I’m 24 years old and I have dementia and I’m bankrupt! It ain’t worth it!”
JH: That’s not worth it
M: “So what are you saying, I should abstain from sex?--Oh no!!”
JH: “No, no”
M: “Abstain from being a linebacka!” [Josh laughs] “Go into accounting!” [Turns the Wheel] Um...well, folks, this might be the best cover we’ve seen in a long time [Josh laughs] Uh, this vid--[Josh laughs louder]--video 5 in a series called “Agitation…” ellipsis, “It’s a Sign.” And a picture of a very cranky old man. Uh, by the Senior Living University. Uhh, this is probably a video, uh, if you’re a cranky old person, you may have some kind of medical problem
JH: Or that you’ve just lived long enough that you understand that everything is bullshit and no one will listen to you. Goddammit
M: Next up!
JH: Hmm-mhm? Oh!
M: Josh
JH: Next up, Manners! Who Needs ‘Em?
M: Ohh goddd! This video? Ugh…
JH: This is the day that we have to watch this 
M: Yeah, yeah
JH: You did?
M: What?
JH: Watch this one?
M: Oh, just shut up!
JH: I don’t--[Looks at the tape] Oh…
[Nobody speaks] 
JH: You’re gonna learn s--
M: What, shu--wh--
JH: You’re--
M: Excuse me!
JH: [Yells over Mike] I’m not done tal--[Cuts to Josh reading the tape, Mike drops his bottle on the Wheel] “The video that makes learning manners…” [Laughs]
M: [Makes retching noise]
JH: [Laughs, picks up the bottle] Fun….” [Throws the bottle behind him, the bottle hits the gate then breaks upon impact with the floor] Huh
M: Hm
[Silence, Josh looks around]
M: Anyways, you were talking about manners?
JH: Uh, it’s a 20 minute video. That’s very--that’s actually really thoughtful, that they pointed that out
M: A video about manners...needs to be 16 hours long. Have you seen some of the people today? [Josh bursts out laughing] 
JH: What’s the last tape, thank God it’s the last tape, what’s the last tape, Mike?
M: Uh, last tape: Surviving Edged Weapons
JH: Wow!
M: Uh, “The best police training film ever made. How to defeat today’s fastest-growing threat. Intended for law enforcement only”?
JH: So if we get this one, only cops get to watch
M: Yeah…[Overlapping dialogue]--obtain this?
JH: We have to leave the room if it’s on, I don’t know
M: Yeah. I’m not a member of the law enforcement
JH: I know, look at this--look at the work on this Edged Weapons, with the cut, it’s like a Guns N’ Roses album cover or something
M: Yeah
JH: This some good shit!
M: Edged Weapons, amazing, simply amazing [Josh nods] Well, Josh!....You wanna give this, uh, Wheel a spin?
JH: Suuuure. Uh--here we go! [Spins the Wheel]
M: Oh my god, the Wheel is spinning!
JH: Oh boy!
M: Our fate is being decided
JH: Oh boy, oh--[The Wheel slows down] Oh, oh
M: Oh god
JH: Ohhhhhhhhh
M: Oh my god
JH: Ohhh!
M: Manners: Who Needs ‘Em?
JH: Do you? [Stares at the camera] 

[10:06] Jay: This is….this is the worst, though

[10:32] R: Alright, Mike! Are you ready to salvage this evening?
M: I am, Rich! I have a good feeling this last spin is gonna pick a great video. Here we go, I’m gonna give it a good spin
R: I’m waiting, I’m waiting for it
M: [Winds back the Wheel] Ow! [Spins it after a few seconds of winding it back] I gave it a good spin, Rich
R: That’s a good spin. I feel good about that
M: Okay. Let’s see, what do we got? Oh my god [The Wheel passes Surviving Edged Weapons, Rich gasps, it almost lands on Manners: Who Needs Them but Mike moves it back a spot] Surviving Edged Weapons!
R: We’re frauds! We’re truly frauds! [Laughs]
M: It’s ironic ‘cause I have no manners

[11:52] M: Milwaukee Cops vs Ninjas: The Training Video

[12:12] M: This is my nightmare

[13:19] R: I don’t remember the last time--no, no, there was no last time where I didn’t finish a fucking Wheel episode viewing feeling like shit. I feel like--I feel like a million fucking dollars right now
J: No, this kept getting better and better
M: Maybe it’s that Pac-Man shirt [Horn blows] [Jay laughs] 
R: This Pac-Man shirt is fucking awesome and you can’t handle it
[Silence]
M: Let me just say this, if I had that shirt….I would be so ashamed [Josh stifles laughter, Rich drinks his soda] Now--
JH: Wow!
M: Why don’t you tell me all about manners and who needs ‘em? [Jay and Josh laugh] 
R: I--I would say that...that you need manners, Mike

[20:28] J: It’s dreams within dreams, it’s the last season of Twin Peaks [Laughs]
M: Was Manners: Who Needs Them a David Lynch film?
J: It kinda feels like it with all the talk of dreams…
M: It makes more sense than Dune

[21:10] [While watching the guy rapping]
R: Can we find and embarrass this man?

[21:25] R: I wanna shake his hand...for having the courage to do that in front of a camera
M: Well, he was probably like 20...now--now he’s 45 and he has a wife and kids, and his kids are in college…
J: And this is like, nobody in the family knows about this video
M: And now, a bunch of slobs from Wisconsin are--are talking about him, and now he’s dead, a--and his wife and--and his grieving children are at the funeral and you’re there in your Pac-Man shirt [Jay laughs] 
J: I think really you just show up with like an iPad with the rap loaded up
R: Yeah, and just--
J: Just go up to..
R: You can dance through the funeral. Don’t talk to anybody, just show up to the door with that already playing, and just...dance my way…[Chuckles]
JH: But you definitely, you definitely want to put some razor blades in your hat
M: Ohh
R: Ohh we’re not there yet! We’re not there yet
M: Yes, hopefully it’s an open casket, so you can throw some MC Hammer plates on it--on it--on his corpse
J: Some styrofoam silverware. Comically oversized styrofoam forks?
M: Yeah, and just say “this is your husband’s legacy” [Jay laughs] “This is your husband’s, and your father’s,” as you look to his children, “this is his legacy, it’s an embarrassing rap video, now part of Best of the Worst episode 128”
J: Or whatever episode this is
M: Or whatever episode, yeah
JH: The last one
M: And then, as they’re lowering the casket into the earth, you...take a giant dump on it [Snickers] [Jay laughs] While wearing your Pac-Man shirt, but no pants. And then you say to his daughters……
J: Manners: who needs ‘em? [Josh and Rich laugh] And then you just run away!
M: You say: “Evan...Evans Out.” I’m so sorry
R: Why do you hate me so much?
M: No, I’m--I’m--this is your liberation, this is a beautiful moment…
JH: He doesn’t hate you, he hates George Washington
M: I hate George Washington
JH: We all do
M: And this man, whose rap embarrassed a nation

[25:55] [The host guy speaks really fast]
M: I’ll have what he’s having

[30:54] M: That is the 1990s: How angry are you that you bought this video for information on xyz and got a scam tape?

[31:40] [Before introducing the final tape]
M: Jaaay…
J:....Oh man...This is a lot of pressure
R: It’s--it’s an honor, Jay
JH: You can’t go--you cannot go wrong
M: The greatest video...that has ever graced this table
J: Surviving Edged Weapons is the Citizen Kane of VHS 90s instructional video tapes. This is...the most amazing thing we’ve ever seen on Wheel of the Worst...maybe the most amazing thing we’ve ever seen on Best of the Worst as a whole
JH: It’s that impressive
R: That’s not a joke
J: It’s--it’s an exciting action film, it’s legitimately informative, and in the most amazing plot twist that I’ve ever seen, we discovered, about 20 minutes into it, that it was made in Milwaukee!

[41:52] R: That scene is where this movie went from being the absolute best instructional video ever made, and it--it went to a level where it is now competing with Lethal fucking Weapon! Unlike Lethal Weapon, you know Mel Gibson’s gonna be fine, these cops...they could’ve died
J: They get stabbed in the dick
R: They’re gonna get stabbed in the dick!
J: Which also happens!
R: You’re afraid for these characters!
JH: There’s all sorts of crazy shit going on in Milwaukee I didn’t even know about! 
J: Yeah!
JH: ‘Cause you know what? After that, they took it a step further! There’s horror music going on, open up the door, it’s a fucking Satanic ritual! 
[Plays clip]
Officer: Holy shit!
[Camera pans to reveal a Satanic ritual happening in the next room] 
JH: YEEESSSS
J: FUCK YEAH!
M: Whaaaaat!
J: YEEAAHHHHH
R: Yes! [Does the sign of the horns] Yeeessss! [Jay and Rich laugh]
J: This is an interesting twist!
(...)
R: I fucking love this video!!

[44:06] R: This...this video is so awesome it has three--three reenacted dick stabbings and then an autopsy photo of an actual dick stabbing!
J: Ohh did you look at it?
JH: That was….
R: I had to 
J: You didn’t had to, I didn’t! I looked away!
[Shows photos]
JH: Oh! [Rich laughs]
R: Oh god!!!
J: I’m not even looking [Covers the screen with his hand, looks at the tv, video pauses, “confirmed for…...curious about autopsy photos” appears on screen] 

[48:45] R: I’m gonna die…..tonight….from--from just the pure joy I have experienced
JH: Karma’s gonna come around and stab us all
R: I’m not gonna last the night

[49:20] R: Horror, action, drama, comedy…
J: It has it all
R: Everything!

[50:14] M: There’s even a moment in this video where they say “cop, if--if you have been shot through the chest, and your lung is in danger of collapsing, you lean your head and you take out either a piece of plastic or a credit card, to hermetically seal the hole, to prevent your lung from collapsing”
JH: I learned that, I didn’t know that
M: You do that...so you can live to fight another day [Rich laughs] To shoot some motherfucker with an edged weapon
J: May be Satanists, may be a gang member
M: A tear came out of my eye and then it turned into a bald eagle....and it flew away! And I said “this is the best video I’ve ever seen”
J: We gave this a standing ovation. That’s the first time in Best of the Worst history
JH: That’s true
R: A legit standing ovation

[51:27] R: I’m not gonna lie, I enjoyed Surviving Edged Weapons far more than I enjoyed the fucking Justice League movie, alright? Like, by far!
J: Oh, sure! Sure!
R: This box says “the best police training film ever made” and it’s...it’s not lying! It makes me wonder what their standards are because...they only gave it four stars!

[52:07] M: Oh, well, Jay?
J: Well, Surviving Edged Weapons, of course, but I do wanna...uh, special accommodations--[Hotel logos appear for half a second]--to Top Slots because I--I--I laughed so hard that I was crying at a certain point. Which, I can’t remember the last time that happened
R: I feel bad for Top Slots ‘cause--
J: Yeah
R:--it had no chance
J: In any other night, this would be the winner. The--the part in Top Slots where he explains that like, he’s--he’s out of money and this is like the last slot he’s gonna play...I was laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes
M: That was a, that was--
J: And that is, that is worth pointing out

[53:18] [In the screening room] 
M: The master at beating the slot machines...has run out of money! [Slowly zooms in on Jay laughing until he cries and wiping his tears away]
