[0:31] [Colin is playing with a Body Rap toy, Jim is moving along to the beat, Mike walks in, they immediately stop]
Mike: What the fuck is going on here?
Jim: Hi , Mike
M: [Sighs] Jim, Colin. You guys are back, huh? [Sighs again] I see you found my Body Rap and opened it. I was trying to keep that mint in the box, it’s gonna be worth something someday [Jim throws the box over his shoulder] Thanks. Anyway, I guess we’ll spin the Wheel now. Would you like to see what’s on the Wheel today?
JM: Yeah
M: Up first, Software Made Easy: 4-in-One Computer Video. What?
Colin: I think there’s four pieces of software that it teaches you how to use. Windows 95, MS-DOS--
M: Ohh, yeah, Windows 95. MS-DOS, Wordperfect, and Lotus 1-2-3
C: Everybody’s gotta know these
M: They are important
C: Those are the four main software packages
M: I have a feeling this video will be dated. It’s just a guess though. Uh, what’s next, Jim?
JM: Next is Kid Sand Airbags [Mike and Jay laugh]
M: An airbag made of sand does not sound like a good idea
JM: No, and the kid’s made of robot parts
M: Next, Road Construction Ahead, which may be made by the same guy who made Cleared for Takeoff, a previous video that we watched because he made a children’s video called Road Construction Ahead, this one says it’s for kids of all ages. “An action-packed video with all the awesome earth-moving and road construction equipment your kids love to watch.” Uh, alright
JM: Next up we have the Osteporo--Osteoporosis Dance, produced by Claude Pepper Older Americans Center and Video Communications Department, University of Connecticut Health Center
M: Umm, is that the full title?
JM: The Osteoporosis Dance?
M: Well, all that other text you read after that--
JM: No, that’s just a description...of the--production
M: Alright, I guess we know very little about this film. Uh, do people with osteoporosis dance or do people dance like you have osteoporosis?
[Jim shrugs] C: I think dancing is recommended when you have osteoporosis
M: We’ll find out. Uh, next is another mysterious video, Farm Safety Family Style, which was also on the Wheel last time. Colin?
C: Yes?
M: What is Farm Safety Family Style about?
C: It’s about farm safety
JM: Next up we have Laugh: Jest for the Health Of...It. Jest for the Health Of It. It’s a granny with a fake smiley face in her hand on a popsicle stick and something called a “Mirth Aid Kit”
C: First aid--it’s like first aid kit
JM: Yeah, like first aid kit, it’s sitting in her lap, and it’s with Patty Wooten, NR--sorry, RN
M: “Registered Nurse”
JM: That’s not a state, RN?
M: No, no, not the--no, not that I’m aware of [Turns the Wheel] Next is the, uh, the star of the Wheel tonight, um, How Can I Tell If I’m In Love? Starring Justine and Jason Bateman, who are brother and sister, uh, I guess we should note. And there’s a tiny picture of Ted Danson behind them
JM: For some reason
C: With a black book?
JM: Like the Ted Danson black book from Cheers, that he…?
M: Oh, yeah, maybe--that is his black book, yeah
C: “Straight talk for teenagers about dating and intimacy”
M: Ohh, so it’s not so they can tell if they’re in love, they’re just gonna give tips, to...oh ok
JM: And it has the squiggly lines and diamond shapes and circles from 80s style, like, kind of like Body Rap
M: Uh, it certainly does
JM: It’s come full circle
M: Oh, How Can I Tell If I’m *Really* In Love, it says, yeah, sorry, that’s the title of...
JM: Uh, American Flatulators “Ah, the sweet smell of competition.” Uhh it was a Golden Roll award winner and it’s people standing in a toilet bowl………….And there’s a gas mask at the top
M: What do you think this video could possibly be about?
C: No idea. You don’t know how long it is...is it like a game show?
M: Are you familiar with American Gladiators? Is there a Canadian version called Canadian Gladiators?
C: No, it’s called American Gladiators
JM: It’s just--they’re on obstacle courses and they have giant q-tips and they knock each other off?
M: There’s a lot of different things happening in there, but 
JM: But in this case, they’ll have gas masks on, which will make it difficult to see
M: Yeah, there’ll be lots of fart jokes in it and poop--poop humor, I’m assuming. Uhh….
C: We can only hope
M: We can only hope, yeah
JM: Flatulations, usually about...farting
M: Well there--I mean, these are toilet paper and, yeah, you don’t fart in your toilet, you don’t--I mean, you could--
Jay: No you don’t!
M: No, I mean, it happens, what I’m saying is you don’t run to a toilet to fart
J: Ok that’s--[Colin laughs]
JM: What’s weird, though, is they have the blue rinsing product that you use in toilets to clean them, and it’s surrounding them, unless that’s supposed to be water
M: I think it’s just supposed to be water 
J: That’s still not how toilets work
M: No...I--I have to say, who did the art--you know, the art is nice, it’s very, you know
JM: Not to scale
M: It’s not to scale, no. Umm…..a toilet bowl that big, uh, would be a problem for most people…a serious problem--
JM: Let alone four
M: Yeah right

[6:40] [Jim does a little dance (?), covers his face in embarrassment and laughs, somebody in the background laughs]

[7:25] [A guy shows up with hi written in a speech bubble beside him, gunshots are heard
Josh: Stop doing that!
Jessi: Colin, is that you?
C: It’s not me!

[7:38] [Girl starts singing]
JH: Stop it!
J: Oh my god…
JS: I hope she falls down the stairs

[7:56] Boy: She doesn’t bother me anymore
J: What did you do to her?
Rich: Probably because of your face

[8:26] Girl: [Turns her head towards the camera] A step ladder 
C: [Turns his head the same way the girl did] A step ladder [Climbs a step ladder and spins the Wheel]

[10:33] J: I don’t know if the one on the right is alive
R: This--this clock, it’s bringing my heart rate up

[10:57] R: You’re such a fuck-up
J: You’re never gonna go anywhere in life!
R: That’s why you can’t afford to retire and have to work in shitty videos like this
[11:30] [Josh spins the Wheel, when it’s about to stop spinning, Jessi pops out from behind the Wheel and moves it so it lands on American Flatulators]
Rich and Josh: [Ignoring her] Yeah! American Flatulators!

[12:32] JM: So far, I hate this

[14:50] M: You didn’t mention this was edited by Salvador Dali

[19:15] M: Bizarre, like, framing, like, no one wants--Justine Base--Bateman is sitting on the floor next to a couch, while she’s wearing a couch?

[19:40] Jason Bateman: Hey mom, let me help with the dishes
JS: What?
J: The editor has lost his mind

[20:13] JH: “I have to face cardinal north at all times”

[20:32] JM: She came out of it all with like, pearl(?) earrings
C: It’s better than a pearl necklace [Rim shot]

[20:57] JM: This is a lie

[22:57] M: I think they could’ve cut that entire segment out of the video, and just kept, um, the awkward interview with students, and the Batemans, and the weird Ted Danson cutaways, where he’s either wiping the cocaine from his nose or smelling his fingers

[23:23] M: Jason Bateman, this is coming back to haunt you

[25:06] Justine Bateman: I say to my boyfriend “I’m in love with you”
JM: What’s his name?
Colin and Jessi: Jason Bateman

[26:04] M: Who did the artwork for the cover? That’s my question
C: I think this was Drew Struzan, he did a lot of the Star Wars artwork, you could tell, he, like--yeah

[26:47] M: “I’m gonna be in a movie”
JS: Ohh...
R: Do you think they’re both gonna make it through this tape...
JS: They have to replace one of them?

[27:37] C: So it’s a, it’s a sort of like personal trainer, it’s like an exercise video, that you’d see, like, Jane Fonda do in the 80s or wherever, like that. And it has two elderly ladies, well, their names’ Linda and--
JS: Uh, Betty
C: These are the names that we gave them. Umm….
M: We find out their real names in the end, but it doesn’t matter at that point, ‘cause they’re dead
C: So they’re on this set that looks like a cable access--
M: Ironically, they’re nothing but bones at this point [Colin wheezes, Jim just stares then glances at the camera]
JS: Jimmy (???)
M: Well, everyone’s thinking it
JS: Look at him, he’s, he’s--
M: Everyone’s thinking it
JH: [In the background] You’re gonna feel really bad when you find out they’re still alive and they watch this. Their grandkid’s like, “grandma, you’re on the--you’re on this show that I like”
J: You know what? [Colin turns around and leans over his chair] Because they did the dance…
JS: You broke Colin
M: He’ll be fine…[The guys in the background laugh]
JS: Do the dance...check your heart rate
C: “They’ll be nothing but bones…” [Wheezes some more]
[Jim is just staring at the table expressionlessly]
JS: [Points to Jim]  (???)
JM: That’s not true, no, I--I just found...I don’t know if the video would be helpful, that’s all I feel about it, is...I [Colin turns around again] I mean, it’s a few steps here and there and...I just sort of feel an elderly person could walk around--[Chuckles]--their habitat
[Jessi and the people in the background crack up] And get as much exercise that way, like…[Starts laughing and covers his face]
JH: “Habitat”? [Jim nods] Their fucking hamster water? 
JM: [Begins saying something but starts laughing and covers his face again]
JH: Why can’t we put the elderly in large balls?
JM: I just mean...they live in a different environment than...than you and me
JS: I guess?
M: The drama from this video came from Betty almost walking into a potted plant
JS: I think that’s where we found a lot of our entertainment, we go “oh, oh, ohh”
(...)
C: Edging closer, like “woah, wooaaahh”
M: Well, the video was, was instructed by…[Trying not to laugh] Tay Zonday
JS: [Laughing] What did you say?
C: Tay Zonday
M: With he--and he had three--uh, six vaginas
(...)
R: She’s got like, seven camel toes
M: Camel feet
[At the table] M: Yeah, he sort of taught two elderly women how to slightly move left and right. On a bad public access set. And then...shit, I don’t know
JS: It was really fun, it was really entertaining
M: I kept waiting for Betty or Linda to trip over a plant or knock down the set
JM: They got very close
M: They got very close--uh, uh, actually, at one point, when the title came up, and it came back, we had noticed that they had moved the plants about six inches over to the right because Betty was coming dangerously close….to several of the plants
[Jim makes a serious expression, glances at the camera again] 
JM: I’m just disappointed that they couldn’t stay in synchronization to--the two background elderly ladies, but...they must’ve practiced before the video was shot
JS: Linda kept fucking up. She was the worst. She was seriously the worst elderly osteoporosis dancer I’ve ever seen
M: And there are only two of them, so that’s pretty fucking bad
JM: Considering the dance is simple…
JS:...terrible!
M: Yeah, I mean, how hard is it to follow those steps?
JM: They what--they were like 70, right?
M: I don’t know,  70, pushing 80
JS: [Laughing] No!!
JM: It’s no excuse
M: It’s no excuse, really, I mean, how hard is it to move your fucking arms? [Jim cracks up] Come on! Like, could they find better old ladies to be in this video? Only two…
JM: I like the move that went like that
M: That was good, that was good, except that they were all off
(...)
J: Shit’s getting crazy
Mike, Colin, Jessi: The kitchen counter dance
[The women just stand there]
M: I--wh--I guess…
JM: Which is really unfair, ‘cause that suggests that every single person with osteoporosis has a kitchen counter to dance from
M: [Chuckes, covers his eyes] That makes no sense…
JM: That can--but no, that confused me, because….yeah, I didn’t understand that at all. I think--I’ve been misinformed or something, because...why did they call it the kitchen counter dance?
C: They weren’t even holding onto something while they were doing it
M: They should’ve brought in three kitchen counters for them to hold on--I think the point was like, they have to hold on to the kitchen counter for dear life….to keep from falling over [Everyone loses it] I think that’s it. I really don’t know, you know...you don’t want to break a bone. Look out for those potted plants
(...)
R: Oh god, we almost went off the stage that time
[Camera slowly zooms in on Betty, she messes up a dance move, everyone cheers]
JS: Goddammit, Betty!
R: We lost Betty!
JH: She’s going for the potted plants again
R: She’s hopelessly out of sync
[At the table]
JS: That’s funny, but wouldn’t it be funny if one of them died, and then they cut to the break where they check in the box(?)  and then there’s just a new person, just replaced them...and no mention. Just keeps on dancing
M: I think Rich said that there would be a title that just said “rest in peace” you know, “Betty”
JS: Not Betty...
JM: “In memory”
M: Yeah “in memory of Betty
JS: It’d be Linda, by the way. Linda’s awful
M: Yea
J: Linda looks like Jackie Mason
(...)
C: And they started getting really uncoordinated by the end, it was sort of like, nobody was in sync--
M: They were getting tired 
C:...free-for-all…
M: Their coordination, like, they’d varied, it would come and go, which makes me think that they filmed this video over 6 months, you know, Betty and Linda can only take so much [Jim makes a serious face] They kept bringing them back, bringing them back…
JS: I’m convinced that…
M: “We filmed 6 minutes today, Betty. You get to lay down and...you know, and it took--it was like Apocalypse Now…
JM: [Starts saying something]
M: Except more heart attacks. I’m surprised the instructor could keep it going with the smell of urine in the air
JS: How many handlers did Betty and Linda need to change their Depends?
C: This is--horrible
JS: I’m sorry, I’m sorry Betty and Linda
M: They’re dead, they’re long dead
C: I thought the comments in the room were horrible, this is so much worse
M: How do you keep it going? Tay Zonday did a great job
JS: She’s a professional…
M: Yeah…[Giggles] They call her ol’ camel feet
JS: They’ll call (???)
M: Yeah, they don’t call he that for nothing
JS: She’s tough (?)
M: Yeah, she could keep her water in, unlike the old ladies. And it’s just leakin’ out. Nobody likes osteoporosis, but they do dance about it [Jessi and Josh(?) laugh] That’s what this is about, it’s a celebration of osteoporosis
C: If you’re over 90 years old and you own a countertop...this movie…
JS: This is for you
M: Yeah, if you have a kitchen counter to hold on to, while slightly moving your feet...to just slightly raise your heart rate so you don’t die sooner...this is the video for you
JM: Ta-dah [Somebody in the background screams]

[37:25] M: Uh, well, The Osteoporosis Dance was very--
JM: Thumbs up
M: Thumbs up, very entertaining, same with How Can I Tell If I’m Really In Love, but our final film of the evening...I won’t say who picked it off the Wheel[A giant red arrow points to Jessi]

[38:44] JM: I’m just thinking right now how to destroy this video tape

[39:01] M: Is it the worst thing that everyone’s ever seen? ‘Cause it is for me

[39:22] R: Oh, shut up!

[40:55] JM: I st--I fell asleep, then I woke up and I got really angry

[42:13] JM: It wa excessively horrific, I mean, it was excessive and excessive and excessive to the point of like…..like it was--it was like a psychopath had--had created this and wanted to keep it going...um, and there was no…[Makes a confused expression] uhh I can’t talk about it

[42:52]JM: Did you see the, um...the critique on the back?
M: No
JM: It says--it says: “a rip-snorting video, guaranteed to leave you gasping for air, Linda Barnard, Toronto Sun”
C: [Widens his eyes] No!
M: Jeez....might as well have a quote from Rob Ford
JM: Who?
C:.......Never heard of him

[43:23] [Josh(?) mumbles a bunch of gibberish]

[43:25] JS: Would you say that it’s safe to say that this movie is a stinker? [Colin laughs] Sorry, that was--a Mike joke and I just had to, I’m so sorry

[45:09] JH(?): Fuck you, Barry and Liz Hirschberg
[Rich gets up, flips the coffee table over, screams and throws his arms in the air]

[47:02] M: What’s so funny about elderly people trying to exercise?
C: Apparently, everything. And the discussion here, recounting it again--
JS: [Whispers to Mike] Must be a Canadian thing
M: Oh yeah, yeah
C: What?
M: You laugh at the elderly up there? We don’t do that
JS: It’s disgusting
M: Really, it’s repulsive
JS: Should be ashamed
M: So go ahead and say what’s funny again, to watch

[48:08] C: I think I would watch this alone...wait--no--[Josh cackles]
M: You don’t want to say that, out loud

[48:32] M: Uh, Jim? Your pick for--[Chuckles]--best of the worst--were you just like, daydreaming?
JM: No! I was--
M: I don’t blame you

[50:34] M: The Osteoporosis Dance is timeless

[51:15] [Clips of various scenes from old French movies are shown between clips of everybody destroying the tape]

[52:38] [As everyone walks away from the burning tape carcass, Rich comes in from the side and throws a cinder block on it
