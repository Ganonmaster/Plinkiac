[0:35] [Rich is standing alone, there is an Out of Order sign on the Wheel, he looks around]
Rich: Isn’t anybody gonna come and--and help me spin the Wheel? Hello?.....I’ve--I’ve been here for two days! It was only two days ago, “Rich...stand by the Wheel, we’re gonna film soon, and then I--I heard some engines starting up, some cars? Were you getting lunch? Hello?? [Sighs]
[Jessi comes out from behind the Wheel]
Jessi: Alright…[Removes the Out of Order sign] 
R: What?
JS: Let’s, uh, let’s get started...Alright, first up is a new one, umm, uh, not quite sure how to pronounce this. Er, um, The Shoj-eye Tabuch--chi…?
R: So it has something to do with the Olympics? The Shoji Tabuchi Show?
JS: Ohh Sochi...yeah
R: It gets a bronze medal from me [Moves onto the next tape] Next we have Dunkin’ Donuts 1994 Fall Donut Event Finishing Video With Bob Rosenberg
JS: That sounds great
R: That sounds awesome
JS: That sounds really good--now, this one is your favorite, so, uh, Florence Henderson’s Looking Great, Feeling Great
R: I--I think if we land on this one the little whammy’s gonna come up from the bottom of the screen
JS: No one’s gonna understand that reference
R: This--this doesn’t look much better, uh, Kitten Kommotion Seven Cute, Cuddly Kittens. They Wrestle, Romp, Explore, Lounge, and Play. So it’s basically YouTube
JS: Yeah
R: Yeah
JS: Alright...next up is fan favorite, SOS
R: Fan favorite?
JS: Yeah, this is one that we--we--we...always keep passing by and never land on it
R: Oh, that’s the one! Right, right
JS: And everybody wants us to watch it, but--
R: Hopefully we’ll finally land on it this time
JS: I hope so 
R: This is the fourth episode we’ve done and we still haven’t landed on SOS 
JS: I know. We need to land on it this time
R: Ok. And then we have Tom Parks in Diabetes: A Positive Approach. It’s very positive that you got diabetes. Right? I hope I have diabetes now, ‘cause my lifespan will be shorter and I can die sooner. What’s next on the Wheel?
JS: Tales from Genesis Space
R: I don’t know what the fuck this is, but it looks amazing. And--and next on the Wheel, is my second favorite video OF ALL TIME “The Art of Dining: The Business Lunch. The Complete Guide to Dining Etiquette for Corporate Go-Getters, Salespeople, Professionals, Executive Horsewives, and anyone who entertains for business or social occasions. This guide will dramatically increase your social confidence when dining or as a host or a guest.” Alright, homegirl (?), let’s spin this thing! [Rolls up his sleeves]
JS: Alright! [Spins the Wheel, lands on Kitten Kommotion]
R: Ohh…
JS: Oh no, let’s do it again
R: Oh, fuck this!
JS: [Starts turning the Wheel backwards] Hold on, hold on, wait, let’s do it--
Jay: Rules are rules
R: No, we can’t
JS: Let’s start it again
R: We can’t
JS: Ok, let’s just...
R: No
JS: Can we…?
R: No, we have to [Jessi spins the Wheel anyway]
J: You’re wasting a spin
R: Now it’s gonna land on something good and we can’t wa--[Lands on Kitten Kommotion again, everyone laughs]
JS: No!!!
R: We have the second spin, we’re ready to go!

[4:04] ???: Meooowwwww!
Mike: Ok, shut it off

[4:26] M:This--this looks like--this doesn’t look warm and cute, it looks like a--like a--like a serial killer’s home video
JS: It looks like a snuff film for cats 

[4:50] [Back at the Wheel] R: Well, Mike. I think you can call that video a “cat-tastrophe”?
M: You ain’t “kitten”
R: You could--you could even say that that video….was a piece of shit

[5:21] M: Owww!!! A fucking spark went in my eye!!! 
R: Let me get the fire extinguisher!
[Rich tries to put out the sparklers with the fire extinguisher but it doesn’t work, Mike and Jay laugh]

[6:09] J: Do you think Bob Rosenberg is happy?
JS: No…
J: He doesn’t look happy
R: He just doesn’t care about this stupid video. He’s happy when he goes home and he counts his executive money
Jessi and Jay: He counts his donuts? [Jessi laughs]
J: High five!

[10:05] M: It’s called the “No Show-ji Tabuchi Show”

[12:17] R: Kitten Kommotion...it’s a video somebody made

[12:35] R: The only thing in the video is that they take these poor, scared cats, and then they put them in front of a blue blackdrop--ba--back--then they...then they put ‘em in front of a blue backdrop and they just throw some baskets on their heads

[13:46] R: If I was gonna have a pet, and I weren’t allergic, I would have a cat
J: Ok
R: But I can’t
M: But you cat? [Jay laughs]
R: I’m sorry? Why did you just say “cat”?
J: Meow let’s get back on track
M: “Meow let’s get back on track”? Is that what you said?
J: What? I said “now let’s get back on track”
M: No, you said “meow let’s get back on track”
J: I said “now let’s get back on cat”
JS: Guys, this is the purr-fect discussion

[16:56] M: Is there anything else to say about Kitten Kommotion? Uh, it’s possibly the worst thing I’ve ever seen
J: How many things have you said that about now, though?
JS: Everything
R: It’s not the worst thing we’ve ever seen, but it is a kitten calamity [Everybody snorts and laughs]
M: That was so terrible!

[18:51] R: He starts talking, and we’re all chatting amongst ourselves, waiting for this intro to end...and then--and then Bob Rosenberg stops talking and the video’s over. So we--we missed the video, when we were waiting for the video to start

[22:22] R: What is this, a Super Bowl showing(?)

[23:17] J: But then, at the end of the video, he doesn’t get the new uniforms in real life, so it’s sort of depressing
[Rich giggles]
R: You know what, though? I--I give it a 4 stars…..out of 50

[24:02] M: Or a video about Rosenberg finishing
J: It could’ve been happening, there was a shot--
R: “Here’s our new frosting!” 
M: But--
R: Bob Rosen--His last video before being fired
JS: He’s just (???)
R: “I’ve got some glaze for ya!”
J: “Time to fuck the donuts!”

[24:51] R: It was short
M: It was short, but not sweet, ironically
[Silence, Rich claps]
M: Thank you

[27:06] R: And then you see these legs walking down the stairs and there’s lights behind him. And then he walks to the microphone and “he-ro evrybody. I’m Shoji Tabuchi.”
M: Was he drunk, or…?
R: I--I think he was both drunk and engrish
M: Ohh
J: What?
R: I think it was both, drunk engrish
[Nobody speaks]
R: That’s gonna cut (?)

[32:08] M: Well, I find the whole thing suspicious

[34:37] J: It’s like Perkins food
M: It’s the Old Country Buffet of music, right?

[36:38] J: Oh yeah, yeah, he introduces his--uh, his band members and one of them’s from Milwaukee and we’re pretty sure it’s Jeffrey Dahmer
Shoji: The next gentleman is from….Milwaukee, Wisconsin
Everyone: Yaaaay!
M: The audience is just like, silent. “That’s not the South!”

[39:18] J: Well, I think we all know what needs to get the axe here
R: Yes
M: It’s unanimous
R: It’s very unanimous
J: We don’t even have to say it, yeah
R: I know exactly what we need to destroy tonight [Cuts to a shot of the Wheel of the Worst in a dumpster outside]
