you've done it all rich so how you doing
hey everybody what's what's going on
what's going on oh yeah it's cold as
fuck out and that's the nature of
January it's true the worst month
sometimes followed by February followed
by March you know it happens is where
we're here that's all that matters
I just made you watch the Nintendo la
Bowl yeah motion controls the cardboard
I don't I don't get it to me it's very
clearly how do we make peripheral so
cheap that everyone will buy them do I
really need the cardboard to just do
this I think you do I think you do for
something I think for a lot of it
they're actually like this is this was
their idea to implement because like
they have like IR controllers in their
joy comm yeah and so like this is the
way they ain't they will implement it
like don't they already have fishing
motion control games that don't require
a cardboard stick yeah but you know you
could have the cardboard thing ha you
say cheap $70 is not cheap well you know
for the game I how much the game is
gonna be probably sixty seven dollars
but then everything that goes with it
you know to buy an extra cardboard thing
I just don't get it
it looks adorable it looks adorable I
probably here's the thing I probably
won't get it unless we're gonna fuck
around with it on streem like I won't
play it or like your kids huh for your
kids they never play the swish yeah you
know they only care about iPad
really yeah they really they only care
about iPad news and like I have stuff
for them like they did go they just go
on a pretty sizable Mario Kart kick is
that just a condemnation of the types of
console games you get these days no I
don't think so I just think it's a it's
an it's a condemnation of iPad games I
think they're I think too many console
games are reared for long plays for
adult audiences for like the real gamer
and this is that their mistake they have
not fostered a new generation i but the
new generation doesn't care cuz they
they have iPad games they can just touch
because they never got a console game
that looks interesting to them that's
right but I mean that they're also
pretty young so we'll wait we'll wait to
see what happens my nephew has an Xbox
one and he plays only on his tablet and
says hello dunno yeah yeah
it's dead Jim what's the gaming it's
dead Jim it's dead I know with that
gaming is that where it's more alive
than ever
I'll be doing split-screen or you just
want me to get you want me to go for a
little yeah I guess we both go in first
I am alright full disclosure I am not at
all excited for this what are you doing
I don't know what I'm doing I'm trying
to start
okay let's green split screen I'm
holding the trigger press the trigger
sure we start is that okay okay you're
not at all excited about this game which
is very I mean I offered I said hey you
know I've gotten a ton of requests for
us to play this game uh-huh
and it was it was part of a weirdo games
bundle so I got it for fairly cheap and
and I was like yeah you know it could be
it could be a silly could be a silly
game to play but you know of course I
said it but of course I said if you had
any other suggestions feel free to it's
awesome
it was like Octodad kind of thing I
can't he won't get back up
well what what what did you do
I wanted to okay now hold on
[Music]
hold on I want to just I wanted to see
if I can
[Music]
okay
use lovesick sigh I appear to be on the
right for anybody who wants to keep
track have a control just grab an
instructional video hold it tight great
whenever you're lost or otherwise in
despair look around for such remotes
once activated they'll provide
instructions ranging from very helpful
to totally useless if there is no remote
around you you may return to initial
despair or you may start looking for
what's important okay yeah humans they
will run into every door they encounter
so you know I said hey everyone's won't
wanted us to play this game rich you
know this was another thing unless you
have any other suggestions and you came
back with good
where's inversion
Oh
does it change it for you sure does it
changed it for you - it changes it for
both of us that's fine if you want Wow
I'll be fine like I'm I'll be fine I'll
I can deal I can deal I'll deal but yeah
just a heads-up game developer would
have been nice if we each got to
customize our own controllers yeah yeah
everyone is probably like two people
their baby pushes we book the sea no I
got it from a handful a handful of
people which is a lot like anyone who
goes out of their way to suggest a game
and then if I get multiples of the same
suggestion to keep holding it
and direction as you may have noticed
you will reach for things that you're
looking at if you can't grab something
or push a button
don't blame your hands blame your head
you may need to look up to grab
something that is high and you will have
to bend over to reach something that is
on the floor don't worry this is a safe
place this game is also on the switch
this would be a good switch game this is
this is a would be a fun couch co-op
game a silly game where you say hey
let's let's have a silly time punch them
buttons they will reach high and bend
low to achieve their goals
great pian fountain perfect
and grab opportunities with both of
their hands is it
you did it yet they can't fly and never
will there you go go okay okay so now we
kind of know how to solve puzzles kind
of you can jump I've already solved the
puzzle jack I did it st. cloud this
trained
I think you need to pull it out of the
way that actually makes sense Jack yeah
I don't you pull this one yeah we can't
jump too high the inversions gonna drive
me nuts now yeah I can I couldn't even
grab the other one and pull all we need
to go the other way Jack no push that
train later
all right now go
[Music]
don't-don't-don't many go back and back
my home no it's fine well I still need
to get on this thing that's your fucking
problem there I got it dad it's fine I
got on thanks for your help
I've been I've been completely d
inverted this is okay we'll go just go
that's fine I can I can I can handle up
and tell you I can I can deal with a
girl man go I'm gonna train it's fair
it's fair puzzle solving solution
[Music]
[Music]
Oh No I need to get on I need to get on
there's a mandatory co-op and it seems
like you can't play this solo can you
maybe not this would be this would be
impossible unless you unless it's one of
those like was that the brothers where
you can like swap who you're controlling
oh maybe maybe one of those do you swap
you control
please customize your character easier
on that wait we can customize our
character
[Music]
yes remote-control hunting anything
[Music]
now there
push objects with your feet walk on top
can you read this yeah I understand what
they're saying what's the saying is push
it back that way push it back to the
wall I get this I get this 100% you can
grab with your feet no grab and then so
then what they're gonna ask you to do
now
so now hop up on it and then grab the
wall and Nina push it with your feet
yeah like that
yeah that's how you do it that's how you
do it
hold on let me look into something here
let's just let's finish this level and
then we'll we'll worry about customized
characters oh I want customized controls
right now that would be nice
that would sure be nice all the column
while walking on so we need to get over
there climb off the top of the stupid
thing I do I do want to climb up on top
of the super thing aka the Train okay
walk I'm too close to the edge well no
wait I've had to go this way away no I'm
fine
excuse me
okay we did it we're like the best
we're like the greatest human fell flat
place ever
yeah I'm fine as long as I don't touch
the camera stick at all we can put it
back ready to jump sure we know I'm fine
[Music]
hello exist
are they waiting for something to update
this I'm reading the chat right now yeah
and I'm realizing that before the stream
started people in the chat we're saying
thank God it's not pub G or Friday the
13th uh-huh again thank god it's not
that how they're feeling about it now
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
I think I'm gonna be yeah we got here
I'm gonna be hazard mask
oh I could be a crash-test dummy that's
neat
you know what then I don't want the
hazard mask at all there all right
that's who I'm gonna be
what's the difference helmet no helmet
oh you don't fly
no I still have the stupid helmet
let's man I don't know
okay
I don't know nothing
we need to talk about a Nintendo level
right now we already had our shockingly
short conversation about Nintendo Lavo
which is it looks I think it looks
really neat I think it looks adorable I
think it's gonna be one of those gifts
like that's gonna be everybody's go-to
birthday gifts like oh johnny has a
Nintendo I'll get him one of these
things because then it's like he's doing
art but I don't know how much actual
gameplay we're gonna get out of it may
change the Hat that's in head where's
head add back
where I demand to know where I've
changed my head
and go to a different model
it's fine it's fine go to go to none now
go there's that oh that's weird
uh-huh haha oh I believe this game is
just puzzles with with funny that's fine
physics
esque controls that's fine that's what
I'm but I'm thinking okay split screen
okay okay no I'm not you jack oh I spent
all that time you want to be a
crash-test dummy no I'm the crash test
of it you just want to swap controllers
if you want I don't really care honestly
I really don't care I think I think rich
is in a great mood tonight on the left
and now I'm on the right I'm the
crash-test dummy reaches the cap pick up
the box
put the Box on the thing are you doing
anything my bikes will probably need the
box right I'm just thinking ahead look
at that see oh I guess I can just kill
myself and then I'll come back to you oh
there you go that's one way to solve the
puzzle you're welcome everybody
come on box I got a box rich your stupid
box bike so we're rich Hey
we didn't need immunity box
fine fine we need a box over here bring
the box
don't try to move the camera don't try
to move the camera okay so okay so what
we're gonna do because you've brought it
up eight million times is we're going to
disable invert look like I've been
saying I've been I would be okay with
doing okay okay I don't wanna be a jerk
I have offered I know at this point
you're being a jerk for not oh nothing
my offer
no that's horseshit
who do we need to bring the box over so
just ball just fall we don't forget
anything I should for fallen we should
have tried to fall with the box oh maybe
you get an extra for falling with sure
if I'd bring a box boo this game boo
well are both being jerk for playing

jerk
we are both being jerk human falls flat
falls flat
ah thank god they're not playing Friday

playing that again it's just not pub G
as long as smug G that's all that's all
I hope I didn't make I didn't make the
jumps doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo
go nope
and off the wall get off the wall
oh so you hear away yeah Nintendo
directs before labo
lab oh yeah they did a Nintendo Direct
mini
in which they they said hey here's some
shit we're working on and included with
a bunch of shit like I mean a bunch of
shit was the for many people the big
announcement which was Dark Souls
remastered yeah is going to be on the
switch okay I think it's you know one it
means that they're you know they're
definitely working with from software to
like the switch is becoming the port
machine just you got a game we'll put it
on the switch will port it to the switch
how old is it we'll put it on the switch
it's hard for me to get excited about
this when I have a PC oh sure you know
all these all these remastered editions
and there may be on par with the PC
editions that came out ten years ago
well and the the the remastered edition
is also coming out on the PC and the ps4
and this is the remastered what is
remastered about a nicer looking smooth
you know cuz like that it runs at the
resolutions that the PC version ran out
when the PC version came out
no no because remember Dark Souls didn't
start off on a PC right it was is it
available on the PC the first one yes
but do er do you remember all the shit
we had to do to get dark souls 2 run
properly like we did a second program we
have to get dsfix just to get the thing
to run if you have that do you need the
a remastered edition i do i don't this
is a whole bunch of I don't know but I'm
looking forward to because you know we
and Dark Souls we got as far as we
streamed it for you and me and so you
know it'll be a nice excuse played on
the switch to to replay it again
okay climbing to fall properly you need
to get high this instructional video
will prepare it for everyone who does
not feel high enough and is ready to do
something about their situation climbing
is as easy as doing yells trying to pull
myself your difference being that yoga
leaps you where you started even have
done properly let's break it down raise
your hands
inhale optional approach the obstacle
lower your hands grabbing the obstacle
look down to pull yourself up walk
forward as you release your hands and
release timing is crucial releasing too
early or too late will not get you high
and you might as well do yoga instead
ah okay yeah this is it's doable go up
there already shit I was watching the
instructional video I was just climbing
man how'd you get up there
climbing man she's climbing man
here's what you do put your arms up in
there or ahead of time yeah
then jump
you gotta you gotta take your hand off
the camera but I jump alright look up
okay
just then if I'd like wait wait wait
look up okay looking up back away from
the wall
all right holding to both triggers walk
forward and jump now pull up you have to
like jump grab pull but then I have to
let go the camera button and my camera
goes back it's a jump you dig how'd you
do that
yeah look up yeah look up and do a grab
yeah for how do you keep looking up
while pressing the jump button just keep
your finger on the thumb and then last
second just take it off and jump you
might not even have to keep looking up
for all I really know I didn't really
yeah all right I don't think you have to
keep looking up so
yeah yeah how did you remove this yeah
oh wait no I didn't I just been running
jump from over here oh no that's where
you need it I think I think I just did a
goofy and it work I did it unintended
cuz I'm special I'm smart you are your
those are two things you definitely are
rich special definitely special
definitely special
I know and smart especially I'm smart
yeah damn it damn it
so in any case Derek with souls
remastered coming for the switch it'll
be nice it'll be nice it'll be it'll be
it'll be an excuse to play Dark Souls
really for me at least
grab on do it why are you flying up
there
pull back over here the train for the
whole train that's what I was trying to
pull the train back that's what I was
trying okay you get on it from up here
then I think my repeated attempts then
you can pull it you can if you want you
could pull the whole train over you know
by grabbing onto the wall but I've been
doing it like this I did it like this
the one time I did it and it's exciting
and it's exciting yeah there's an easier
way to get across there though you can
get back on the train and just pull the
train over
oh yeah that's way better
shit how do we get the rope back
how do we get the rope bag with jump for
it my rope
the rope where was the rope it was over
here and I'd tried to swing and then it
went bad oh shit we can do some of these
bars here hey these bars is loose jump
for it like a boss and maybe what I have
to do grab oh you did it I swing
swing your fucker
you can almost fit through these bars
Hey
I fit my body through yes fit my body
through the bars Richard no way my head
stuck your head I got my head stuck in
the bars damn it I don't think this was
the right way to go I'll be honest with
you hit it almost looks like my head can
fit though you know nope hey I got in
reach I got in the cave I'm in the cave
what's in here nothing
Wow what do I do here oh I got in a cave

green cube if there's an opportunity to
fall off something don't do it because I
have found a green cube I will wait for
the cube and now I am the king of the
cube what do I do with the cube that is
a great question but I have it where am

at the beginning now I'm back at the
beginning but I have a cute
I just let's just I should just leave
what are we doing the cube

I'm riding this
as I couldn't get I couldn't get in the
mother
bring the mother to me
yeah climb the mother put the roof on
the mother put the roof on the mother
okay we did it yeah okay get out of the
bucket now that's your job get out of
the bucket I made it over freedom
freedom to find more cubes really give
me some cubes rich took my cue
you took my ride yeah I did deal with it
deal with my QB revenge oh you didn't
mean the ride you were just being stupid
why what no I just walked right over the
hole I made well hey it's a push I think
I've been pushing it until you stopped
me from pushing it I feel like you
stopped me from pushing
this guy's all right
yeah it's kinda silly
it's a whole lot of silly that's
I'm gonna be okay I have the superior
intellect
I am the Khan to your check off okay
as as relates to what puzzles oh all
right
be it do it con I'll be over here check
it out
I'm checking out the next area you
puzzle it up over there I'm gonna look
over here in the construction zone
there's nothing
that's absolutely not
watch out below
I was nothing up here either
yeah my moves
how you extend the game's length this is
probably make the movement speed
insanely slow maybe no games are 10
hours long
legitimately moving slow was an artistic
choice yeah there we go there we go I
got the dumpster down wish did what no
oh but oh wait there's another dumpster
now I think came back
oh we must need that dumpster but for
what rich
got a wonder
it's over here
can we float in the dumpster
I got the mad strats yeah yeah well good
straight - yeah where are you would you
go I'm all the way over fucking here how
did you get over there with my elite
skills that's what well maybe if you
explain them to me well the point of ads
puzzle game Jack
I'm trapped over here if you can climb
like a liar you cannot
one arm he takes two arms pull yeah
takes two arms to pull you up is what
I've learned this might be a mistake
regret this
this might be a mistake and I might
regret this hour my middle names
yeah
nice game just one of me over it's cute
haha I figured out no I found a
different way what are you doing
I'd wildly jump to the arch and then
crawled along the top of the arch and
just kind of wiggled my way over here I
[Laughter]
hit a switch okay I don't know what it
does yet okay
whatever this thing now that didn't move
okay do we want it to that's over here
did you hit this switch
nothing yet I'm saying we have to pull
out the support structures yep now hit
it
wait wait for me that demon
at the door go see if we can figure this
out
Wow look at that look at that you did it
okay okay
this game is growing on me more and more
puzzles everybody loves them who's that
do you see movement
kill kill me
aha
keep it stolen keep what still the
platform what no we need you back over
there
go back go back why explain here never
mind just stay stay by the box too late
too late
[Music]
where's the where's the facepalm button
Hey look I'm back by the switch I made
it worse the facepalm button
come on back
okay flank go back a little wait wait
wait wait I think I got it move it just
a little bit that way so it's like a
straight platformer that crazy one yeah
we could probably deal with that okay
don't move don't move it we're going to
use it I'll jump on like I did less than
all right
oh and they've fallen off I think work
you have it's fine everything's fine we
nice to meet it still made it
that's all it matters still made it
what's up with this rock
oh crap it sounds windy as fuck outside
I think because it's windy as fuck
outside mm-hmm I'm gonna try something
stupid
nope
Oh God the rocks
let go like Oh buddy do it I can try to
throw me I don't think it works
oh we're just fine use you alright so
what do we do all these rocks
that's the question what do we do with
all these rocks where do we need to go
to shoot over that wall through this
wall I mean no way this shit over here
it's over there I don't know yet okay so
far a lot of nothing else where we came
from shit
if you just jump off you should come
back to me
should
I hope the solution isn't a build a
bridge no I'm sure there's a more
elegant way to do it but I can't think
of one so there's probably a smarter way
to do it
- mani raucous pole-vault I don't I
don't think that's likely no I can't
even imagine how one would pull bolts we
can stack rocks stack the shit out of
some rocks
that's about all we got use you come on
come on rocky boy there we go we can do
this we can do this we can do this
it's gonna be a better way of doing this
I'm thinking I can take my I got a small
plan okay so now what if we use that
blue guy over here yeah hang it off the
edge and when you know jump around mmm
Jack that might be the smartest thing
you've done the night yay rich said I'm
smart now we'll need to stack some rocks
on this side of it for Stan Stan I guess
thanks miles
hey well we gotta get a closer to the
edges up before this useful yeah now now
can you both move it sure with the rock
Jack's premature of the rock move the
rock move the record I just didn't want
it to fall I got I'm holding it all
right should we stay with her actually
here's the plan here's the plan move
back move back move back move back
all right rock me
wait I've crawled on top of the rock you
are rockets
that's my work no no yep
yeah I'm over all right another board
like out I mean you could or you can
just make it this is a speedrun of human
fell flattened I did fun to watch
actually that would be awful presuming
they don't just clip and skip back
alright Jack you want to move that log
yeah
okay so after I'd let you do the brisket
part I'll just let Jack take care of
that log
[Music]
on top looks like a whole long sure
that's what it looked like
I bet you that's a whole lot of
