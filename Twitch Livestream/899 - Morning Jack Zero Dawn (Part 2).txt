hello we're back
hopefully we're back oh okay here we go
now to the frozen wild oh how about that
hello everybody can you see me can you
hear me
are we back we're back eyes jack playing
on the ps4 or ps4 Pro I'm playing on the
regular the regular old ps4 I did not
get a pro when it came out because I
already have a ps4 and I didn't quite
see the point oh shit oh shit that is
that is a super volcano right there with
lightning as a volcano with lightning ah
let's see this is a wonderful treat the
deals team the DLC seems appropriate for
this time of year and you are very
skilled at balancing chat conversations
and gameplay also I just noticed that
you have the right kind of voice for a
late night radio Oh sigh I've heard that
before something I talked about earlier
is I am gonna I think I'm gonna give
that a audiobook reading thing a try
that riches sister was talking about
where were you trying to get jobs for
reading audiobooks I really all I want
to do is one just to see what it's like
let's see what's up with it
I just wanted is this a fire no where's
the fire
want to save fire is there gonna be a
Sunday stream or only until after
Thanksgiving there will be a Sunday
stream we will be streaming on Sunday
and then we probably won't stream then
I'm gone so then it's up to rich whether
or not he's gonna do any solo streams
after Sunday because after Sunday I
leave out of town and won't be able to
stream at all until the next week Sunday
so I don't know if rich is gonna do a
Thanksgiving stream or or even just a
regular Wednesday stream we will we will
find out as soon as I know you will know
I should do voiceovers for guided
meditation everything is fine all of the
time now breathe in everything is fine
there's the fire
you think you said he'll do one but
you're not 100% you know it's it's
completely up to him how he's feeling I
mean we already had his entire family on
stream that what's more Thanksgiving
than that than awkward conversations
with your family sorry for Adam
breathing heavily I couldn't have but
notice you drinking water and coffee
during suburban Sasquatch that is true
Brown Adam Sandler only water and coffee
during suburban sasquatch
as that was the first best of the worst
that I did since my more drunk than I
would like
Halloween stream so I wanted to do an
episode completely and 100% sober so
suburban Sasquatch was was important for
me doing that get ready for a rare sight
Nora
Bergeron purveyor of nearly drunk enough
Oh way to the new age not today okay
wait we're into some story stuff now
because the bodies can be recovered by a
nasty business all their best work I
peruse are lost
so they're getting a different kind of
sender
I can't tell you too much about the
village it just got to the new area that
was reef ameliorating myself with the
controls in the combat so I just got to
the new area here and we will see how
the new dlc so far the one enemy I
fought kicked my ass a little bit but
grasp your grief my hunters and kill it
for our kin seize the fates albany long
for his mouth is glowing racking steel
is struggling blue is over now you have
witnessed their spirits rise up into the
blue sky and beyond the blue light I
didn't warlords and our struggle is only
beginning
soon we will again take up the hunt
against the demon that frenzies the
machines against us
his mouth is glowing he has a light
inside of his mouth I don't know if you
guys can see that it's very strange
will you fight
our enemies are pre normal here there
there's a definite blue glow coming from
inside of his mouth
machines that wiped out best and what do
they want to do go back up there fools a
little advice up for free hey boy hey
boy I've been up here for too long
winters and I still can't make sense of
the balloon take this ruckus it started
with one of their shamans if zelda a 60
frames a second in power but there won't
be a single person we say this game is
better than their two very good wearing
up there and this the combat of this
vanished Cree is better than the Zelda
games
fighting the issuing are gearing them
significantly more satisfying many
things about Zelda is better are better
than this you know the the exploration
of Zelda is so much better the ability
to climb anywhere the the resource
gathering all of that stuff in Zelda is
better but the combat in this is
significantly better
so I want to know more about this Damon
mm-hmm it's crazy talk a lie or there's
something to it something connected to
how the machines behave then you need to
find a way yeah
so the mountains big hurry for me I know
I had a lot of hiccups with breath wild
I was dropping a lot of frames when I
played and the Zelda game that I dunno
where you could I have the recordings
can prove it
you win north of the river some better
hardware might have helped but that's
that no in no way diminish how good
English new structures and the master
20,000 is exactly correct which is I
don't care what people I don't care what
people say is better but both are good
games and that is really true both are
very pretty it's pretty crazy to say
Zelda combat isn't as good when there
are merging gameplay elements
I'd prefer I prefer this I prefer
fighting giant robot dinosaurs with all
sorts of traps and shit that is my
personal preference
Zelda Kombat I found frustrating because
my weapons kept breaking and I'm not a
big fan of my weapons breaking stranger
I heard you mention a flood yes a sudden
delusion without rain or milk tips I
just got here did Jack already finish
the base game yes I finished the base
game and now I'm doing the DLC and I
just got into the new DLC zone so this
this is all brand new out by the old
ones a chamber a basin and music
breaking is never fun mechanic I I
dislike it I really it really bothers me
when I can use the same weapon over and
over again and get you know just best at
best myself with that weapon I don't I
don't like it yes I didn't lie I even
don't like that in blood-borne even
though in blood-borne it was just never
a big deal with because you were back at
the you were back with the dull so often
that you just fix your weapons but I
don't like weapon digger
degradation right now but our battles
are few and far between
mostly turn up my volume a little bit
more it's hard to hear me over the game
I know we're at a talking point of the
game of course if the waters don't
receive their game is a little softer
now alright
where is this place I wouldn't mind if
you could repair your weapon on the go
that would be nice right just make it a
little bit easier all right we got it we
got some sight we got some sidequest now
come on come on a light let's see if we
can find a what do you got for me
bubonic bows I need blue gleam I need to
find me some blue gleam so I can buy
some bondic bows oh god what an ugly
outfit look at that look at how ugly
that outfit it's that's not so bad oh
that's cool nor a silent hunter master
that's a neat outfit I like the face
mask
look at that it's terrible
what Jack is using a face cam in a
soulish room I am hi got my green screen
and everything it's crazy it's a lot
easier to use a face cam during the day
cuz I don't have that like one harsh
light on me I you know just it's great
it's great
Jack's just making up words and a blue
gleam is a thing that I need there's a
to over yeah I'll go to the close one
first Jack would you go back to SDV when
they add multiplayer or are you done
what's STV Luthien tinuviel star Oh star
do Valley start - Valley no probably not
I'm kind of done it's it's a very fun
game but you know I did the thing that I
wanted to do multiply I don't know if
multiplayer would help me at all but I
do not want to hear this talk from you
again
doubt is said within a week snow forgive
me my chieftain we was not ready for the
next but you have to see now see this
messing up must be done
what type of green screen am I using
it's a full 91 good and the light
changed slightly here hold on me
Outlander I suppose you wish to speak
Ida I'm just
it's gonna follow me it follow me how
about well let me see if I can fix that
that's annoying you know that is
annoying
alright yeah we're gonna go so like you
know boom there's my green screen
oh you can see it a little little corner
peeking out over there nope it's just
it's just literally a green screen
leaning up against the wall that's it
that's the only thing that's in there
there we go Oh everything up I messed
everything everything up here we go hey
are you doing
I broke it I broke it and I'm sorry I
will try to fix it there we go and how's
my mic sorry
alright now that's looking pretty okay
okay great everything's fixed now and
OMG the second corner it should be fine
it's not on the game at all right yeah
it should be fine great do the no-face
thing again it's fine everything's fine
great
Jack glitches on live feed local doctors
what
it's all fine them great great we fix it
everything's fixed I have not been
paying attention to this story
sellers if you are hearty enough you can
venture out and see the signs yourself
Jack was Chrome for a second great
change to the machine yeah I press the
wrong but stronger I press the wrong
button surrender for the shamans to
debate you're set on going back to the
mountain I put my word to it even with
the risks being so great the risk of
what death it would be a worse fate to
bow our heads the challenge say too much
yeah good get out of here for D let's
get out of here all right you want his
hat
all right let's see it let's go see what
this shit get it let's go see what this
world has to offer
the froze in the wild look at that big
ridiculous headdress that's crazy can
you fly in this game you know there is
there is quick travel after you find
campfires you can quick travel to other
campfires
forget actually how you need you need a
special thing and I think I've run out
but there is a quick travel you cannot
fly you can ride certain Robo dinosaurs
it could be improved modified find a
bird hasn't been stripped by shamans
past look for a rail inside the length
of your spear that's all I can tell you
get a rail from some metal birds in a
cave sounds perfectly normal
great all right we got some assignment
look at
that's some trippy would be water I die
I cannot die my outfit by going into
water
I love horizon zero down
outfits it's like an Empire of the Sun
music video yeah yeah there's a lot of
good there's a lot of things I like
about this game you know there's just a
lot to like about this game good but so
many games well that's that's the real
that's it's a good problem to have this
cigs fan there are goats over here
there are officialy goats over here it's
a real good problem to have just too
many good games to play but I this this
was one that I definitely came back and
I it was really important to me to
finish the story of this because I
really wanted to see how it ended I
loved how it ended I won't get into
spoilers but this was definitely one
where I I went out of my way to to
finish it
see some weird water proceeds to dive in
it wouldn't you
it's a video game I know I don't
necessarily care about you I'm sorry I
just wanted to use your campfire what
that fine are you gonna check out
Assassin's Creed origin no no I do not
plan on checking out Assassin's Creed
origin I played the first Assassin's
Creed ages and ages ago and it never
left that big of an impression on me to
be quite honest with you okay well you
know what let's go um let's go to our
tall neck friend here and get the lay of
the land
so after I played the first one and I
don't even know if I finished the first
one to be to be quite honest with you
but it didn't leave that big of an
impression on me so I've never played
any of the other Assassin's Creed I do
really want to watch the Assassin's
Creed movie which is supposed to be
terrible I really want to want that
Assassin's Creed one is a terrible game
well it wasn't that bad because it got a
whole franchise out of it
here's the Tomek
whereas it's all night
just
the scavengers
right
now what scavengers pretty talking about
are you talking for
as the game noticed something that I
haven't
our beefs because these guys are
scrappers not scavengers right let's see
here I played Black Plague
I perhaps your focus can help settle
them
oh here we go those guys
get off
she just said it she just said it
anything my focus can reveal
oh there's the Tomek oh it's broken its
whole neck is broken interesting
so then stop looking at me I got it
he's into a Lloyd making observations
for you a main problem you went
in your video discussing yes she talks
way too much and I like the voice
actress but she just talks way too gosh
darn much
wait nope
No
tena koe straight critical straight
everything's fine everything's fine so
yes I do believe that a Lloyd talks too
much and it is very distracting it's
very very distracting and more
importantly it takes away from you
exploring because you want to explore
and then all of a sudden a Lloyd will be
like OMG did you see that over there and
you're not even looking over there
okay okay put it put it
yes it goes hit him hit him
actually you know what kind of sucks
about this is it's really hard to see
your white aiming reticle with the snow
it's really hard to see your white
aiming reticle on the white snow that's
okay let's be smart that's peace let's
be smart
his weakness is to fire I do have a bow
that has a fire so we will use that and
you don't have any fire you have fire
I'm already using
okay everything's gonna be fine guys
don't everything is gonna be just fine
if I can
yeah nope
gotcha
did it it's fine everything's fine
we did it guys we did it
let's make sure okay
now we can go up there and clear out the
scrappers alloy we're not starting this
we are not starting
perhaps my focus can help me
all right
no problem you're gonna be our main
quests so now we need to find the
missing tall neck parts this is
interesting I like this you know for all
the other ones the tall necks were
pretty we're pretty basic just hop on
its head do the thing this gives us a
little more things to work with Jack I
tried my best to defend riches honor on
the YouTube page from butthurt final
fantasy fan boys some people have a hard
time hearing criticism you know that
happens yeah that that stream I don't
think worked out perfectly for any one
fan of Final Fantasy or not I think it
was I do think it was a bit of a mistake
to have all those new people there and
rich playing a game that he didn't
necessarily enjoy I think that was a
little too much so I think some of it
got a little muddled but
to be fair rich was being a baby he was
and it could have been funny but there
were just too many people here so I
think I do think that stream in general
got a little model but I still think
there was some fun there I'm gonna get
some more water I'll be right back
Oh
need some more water
Bourdieu well we like I said I I had
brought I was told
I was told that just riches sister was
coming that only that only Aaron was
coming that's what that's that's all I
knew and I had assumed that Karen might
be there as well yeah you know Richard
sisters in town so then I I had assumed
that Karen might be there as well and so
I say to myself well then there's four
of us and if there's four of us then we
can do board entrance so I had brought a
bunch of board games with me I brought I
brought the Barbie board game
I brought underlings of underwing which
is a game I have think it's super
enjoying me and I do want to us to play
on stream Dave just because I think it's
a neat game
I had brought a game that I've been
learning how to play a little bit here
and there that I've also really enjoyed
called burgle Bros and that's a game
that I think rich would really enjoy
because it's about being a sneaky little
thief and I know rich likes that kind of
like the sneaky games
so
I was a critical strike critical trick I
was looking forward to board games
hey Louie
but then there were just too many people
there so you know right I didn't know
that we just other sister was going to
be there block you and then that which
is dad was also going to be there so
they were just way too many people for
board games like we have it we had a
hard time just we had a hard time I
think just getting us all in the room
dinglehopper
need to do what with my logitech camera
like shit
you
whoa shit no shit almost fell off a
cliff almost LF cliff everything is
gonna be fine
everything is going to be
all right he's too far away
excellent touch excellent Dutch top top
form Dodge
gosh dang it
sit down here get down here so I can
kill you die
died already thank you we got we got him
floor plans over what
burger Bros has an iPad version I'm
always wondering if I should buy it
thoughts on if it works as a
single-player I did see that it has a an
iPad version space I cannot comment on
whether or not it works as a
single-player game I've played a few
rounds that I played a few rounds as a
multiplayer game and overall I have to
say that I enjoy it I don't know if it
would work as a single-player experience
but it's all there you know it's
basically a lot of it is is just an
invisible ink a lot of it is just
invisible ink you know you have to you
take your turns it's grid-based movement
and then the guards take their turn and
you just have enough to figure out your
way around to be procedurally generated
map
so I think it would work as a
single-player experience very easy it
would translate is I guess what I'm
trying to say it would translate into a
single-player experience very easily but
I've played a couple of two-player games
and I've enjoyed it
I've only I only have experience though
with the kind of easier version the way
burgle Bros goes is you have random
floor tiles that that mean like you know
an alarm room the bathroom a safe room
and you randomly make three floors that
you have to explore while while dodging
guards and the easy version is to only
burgle two floors and I've played a few
rounds of that which I've really enjoyed
where I played a couple rounds of that I
so I dug that
ouch
down down thank you
where is that going that is the question
I find myself asking at the moment it's
okay focus can help
but
run run run away run away
either two of them spiders
wait-wait-wait-wait
freezing arrows freezing arrows
everything's fine
okay got one got one
it's gonna be fine
fuck
stop moving
tic
I thought I killed the little one but
apparently a new little one showed up
if everything's gonna be fine and
everything's gonna be fine
everything's good
except for I'm gonna die
probably
yeah fries already hold the dick above
the machine damn it damn it damn it
everything's gonna be fine
my bow is not very powerful
my fries bajos not very powerful
so now I got him tied down I'll run over
here I'll be smart
it's more ammo
please please please him freeze him
please freeze him
please freeze him freezy thing
freezing him
there we go thank you
dang it
go here go okay go get him go get him
we get it we did it everyone we did it
son of a bitch week two cold lives in
cold I am aware of the irony all right
we got the towel next stabilizer oh what
are you guys talking about in chat there
settle down all of you that's an order
we did it I mean I did it well you know
we get worried we all were into this
together I feel you know you guys are
you guys are here with me blue gleam is
a rare and valuable resource traded to
specialized merchants ah here's our Blue
Beam
that's how we can get our fancy new
weapons and shit exact you guys are my
moral support exactly that's exactly
what you guys are let's see here oh it's
really hard to read that hold on this
says hello jack and greetings from the
faraway land of Slovakia well Wow
the city of brats love up I wanted to
have you guys seen a cure for wellness i
i have nots and I don't know if Michael
J have either so I cannot I cannot
answer your question satisfactorily and
I'm very sorry about that
we got here demonic scrappers who have
no weaknesses yay but happened to be
walking right next to an area where they
can't see me is that we're gonna use
that to our advantage obviously
nothing nothing nothing
have you played the XCOM board game I
have not I have not that the XCOM board
game I want to say is very expensive and
so you know I thought like rich and I
might be interested in that but I think
that's a tough sell for like just a
random board game night
it's a everybody let's play this weirdo
ex-con board game we did try one night
we did try to play the Dark Souls board
game and realized very quickly that that
was not a board game we could play after
watching a few videos on it like you
know how to plays and you know best
things play it's what I've learned is
it's a board game that is not meant to
be played every once in a while I did it
must be like the board game you are
addicted to and I'm not ready for that
kind of time commitment you guys gonna
get a ps4 pro we are not planning on
getting a ps4 pro I would be honest with
you
we are not planning on getting a ps4 Pro
because the ps4 still works you know
there's I'm not I'm not really compelled
to get
just a fancier version of something I
already have that works so
is there reason to get a ps4 Pro if you
have the regular nine oh the priming the
pro isn't better you know it has more of
the things
I don't know you know and apparently it
can handle psvr significantly smoother
being someone who's not really
interested in psvr I'm not interested in
the Pro either
let's set them on fire let's do this
let's sit up on crack
yeah come on over here see what happens
what
what they didn't fall from a trap oh
look both of them went around my trap
few dingleberries
mad trip my mad trap strats were left
left me wanting well there's only one
left now let's set a fun little trap and
you guys can watch it fail how about
that see me don't you
now where you going
get it while I can
yeah come here come right here
if I have to push you through my trap
you are going to set off my trap that's
how that's how I'm gonna play this game
we did it ah great everything's great
everything's great
didn't expect to stream now perfect
timing I'm on my lunch break well
welcome rich with the Dragon Tattoo
every time I play a final Friday the
13th and I see a bear trap a little Jack
in my head says mad trap strats
absolutely absolutely gotta set those
traps all right where am I going now no
back to the tonic back to the topic
gather some that is smart
what do you think about the new Justice
League movie I haven't seen it it comes
out tomorrow I think so I haven't even
had a chance to see it so I have no
thoughts therefore I have no thoughts on
it I am interested you know rich and I
talked about this talked about this a
lot wait it was just like from a pure
from a pure academic standpoint it is
going to be fascinating to see if there
is a difference a clear-cut difference
between the the Snyder stuff and B Joss
Whedon stuff
am I going Oh over here that that to me
is what will make the movie interesting
so so I'm probably gonna see it I don't
even know if I'll be able to see it this
weekend to be known as game it gets
annoying the the the biggest annoying
thing was during the day you know you
have this nice bright reticle actually
let's see if we can change the color
event you have this nice reticle that
gets completely lost in the snow
it's road control mapping okay let's see
if we can actually change our the color
of our no you cannot okay I've heard is
very totally inconsistent because with
the Joss Whedon and Zack Snyder thing
right well that's that to me he's what
makes it interesting
that's what I'm looking forward to is
like you know play you play a little
guessing games play a little guessing
game what what's josh's and what's Zacks
metro Joe uh no I do not I do not know I
know nothing
nope what am i go to games right now and
your rare moment of free time this is
what I was really looking forward to
playing
but I've been really enjoying hand to
fate too
so I've been I've been getting more time
into hand debate too than I assumed I
would
no way I'll be able to take a machine
that big down
should be a good spot for jumping onto
the tone I'll just wait for him to come
around again this game is damn good
striker 1 1 2 1 yes yes it is I really
enjoyed this game it's one of the few
games where I actually cared about the
story I like how it looks the combat is
great Robo robot dinosaurs you can't go
wrong with robot dinosaurs the rottens
and if you guys have you guys heard
about that Rotten Tomatoes is not
releasing the thermometer score of
Justice League I want to say until today
they're they're releasing it today now a
lot of people like to blame their that
Warner Brothers owns a portion of Rotten
Tomatoes which could be partially true I
think what is more likely the case is
they have started a new show there is a
rotten tomatoes what does it watch it
skip it show and
yeah that's it was holding it for their
stupid reveals how they they have a new
show that they're putting out talking
about new movies and I think they were
holding onto it just for hype on that
show they want as many people to watch
that show as possible and so here you
have a huge movie that is gonna get a
lot of attention and and that's the real
reason why they were holding on to it
just to get attention for their show
they finally oh they did they did
finally release the tamama tur and it's
at 40% I mean all right
40% that's great that's just great
well and you know I know they they
really they released the social media
embargo a little bit ago so I've been
hearing bits and pieces about how in
general people do not like it and you
know we'll get all the reviews in time
all right now I just have to watch its
head
from what I have been hearing as far as
you know critics and reviewers who I
followed the general statement is now
it's not good but it's not as bad as
Batman V Superman which I mean come on
can anything be as bad as Batman V
Superman to skill points what we want to
use
Riis damage that's a good one I have
none of these can the researchers and
search down enemies while mounted that's
interesting disassemble resources and
modifications into 50% of their metal
shard value ooh you know what that'll be
good because then I can get rid of a lot
of crap and just get shards yes Suicide
Squad you can be worse than Batman V
Superman you know what
Darkwing schmuck Touche Suicide Squad
gets the coveted worse than Batman V
Superman title you did it you found it
out
there we go okay here's all of our new
dlc area look at this what are you what
are you great hey Jack did you ever play
borderlines - uh no I did play the first
Borderlands and I thought it was alright
I've talked about Borderlands a little
bit here and there
Borderlands I found to be pretty fun
overall but I felt that the fun of the
game got bogged down by the math gun
secondary game stopping all of the fun
shooty pew pew stuff so you could see
which numbers were bigger than what
other numbers of guns you had became
increasingly tedious and so I did not
even finish Borderlands 1 and never
looked into the sequels
but you know there there was a lot of
good in there hi judge frowny-face
welcome we're getting a little later
here I'm probably gonna have to stop
streaming in a bit so I can eat lunch
but I think this has been a fairly
successful morning stream overall we're
gonna see if we can get a little bit
further let's talk to to hear well I
come back after lunch probably not I
have started you find me we recorded an
episode yesterday so I should really be
editing that I've told it's an audio and
so I can't don't do that on stream
there's nothing fun to do on stream I
just Auto editing wise so live on camera
I'll order a pizza
don't worry I'll double-check my address
you can't fool me
eight o'clock here in Sweden it is it's
one o'clock and only a few weeks there's
a one o'clock here in Milwaukee and
energy pulses from them at least the
machines even repairs them it would be
nice if Borderlands included a equip the
best weapon option for extreme casual
play it could be it could be really nice
but also I get that that's why people
like it you know that's why people like
Borderlands is figuring out which weapon
they want to use because you know maybe
this one does more damage but you know
this other one has a freeze mechanic or
something so I would actually like to
see audio editing streaming I think it
would just I wouldn't be able to talk
over it I think would be the problem
and make sure I read my credit card
number clearly when ordering that beats
that you're right
Sir Lancelot Mick but yes I do like this
i I really enjoy this game Arthur said
this Damon was I've made it all the way
through the main story I'm I was really
excited when the DLC came out extra
excited now that I have an excuse to
play it more dangerous but I am very
very very much enjoy horizon zero dawn
even though it has possibly the worst
name in any video game because it's hard
to remember eruption is there an email I
can reach you guys for a question
absolutely pre reckless at red letter
media calm that is PR e are ec at red
letter media calm that perspective my
hand looks giant so yeah
what are your favorite parts of horizon
zero dawn just any any large dinosaur
battle any dinosaur battle that takes
longer than five minutes are my favorite
earlier when we were fighting the big
dinosaur and like the Stegosaurus
looking dinosaur robot dinosaur and you
have to like knock off its own weapons
and use its weapons against him I love
that love it great fun great fun alright
you want to stop the spread of the
Damon's work I know how to get started
with my bow and spear Outlander wait you
tell me your name good
if you fall to the Damon's machines at
least I can properly recount your
efforts to Araya thanks for the vote of
confidence but I won't fall
let's see we got here fearful slug boy
says overwatch path patch with the new
healer just went live maybe get a match
in before you leave you won't but a boy
can dream play some overwatch soon
though please perhaps we can do that
next morning stream get some over
lunchtime in the new healer does look
very exciting
maybe I could override it it looks like
a like a more interesting Zenyatta I
like that
I like that there's a lot there's a lot
of good in the new here it looks cool
so yes I'm looking forward to playing
overwatch which the new healer and we
can do downstream we can do that up for
another morning stream it'll be great
oh crap
that was dumb that was done running away
running away can't see me I can't see me
no you can see me you can see
there we go everything's right
I'm stuck in a rock
Oh
so every time that thing uses purple it
heals them I'm not even gonna bother
with that guy until I can take over the
tower that's what we're gonna do
look
ok we did it we did it everyone now
maybe we can go back and kill the big
chicken the big robot Dino chicken yes
yes lamb what it's all fine now it's all
fine now
oh that's right that's the one that can
this is the new DLC
this is the new DLC we are in the frozen
wilds
and everything's great
and everything is great okay
ninja quick my commuting strat there
Jack can't write what Mac can take care
of a little chicken having grown up on a
farm and alright see no there's no need
to worry the war gather snap Mullins
optional
lucky me there's snap malls oh it's
probably by the next one that's probably
by the next one all right it's fine
everything's fine and it's brief - Slava
oh sorry if I'm if I if I mispronounce
your your city name but are you really
that surprised you know on the on the
subject of people's who people whose
work you enjoy and they turn out to be
dickheads right a lot of that has been
coming out recently and there's no clear
way to to to figure out whether or not
that's going to affect your enjoyment of
their work in the future
it has for me it has for me for some
people seems I can take care of the
machines and towers the Damon's next you
claimed its powerful yourself somehow
perhaps Soria should meet you after all
what she truly seeks is hope it's a it's
a it's a cultural change for the better
though here's what I will say people
people are feeling comfortable coming
forward with this abuse or mistreatment
covered even Terry Crews right even
Terry Crews just came forward and I was
giving stories and there is a cultural
change where people no longer feel that
they have to keep these things secret
and I think that is a good thing overall
anyone who's a creepy creep owed needs
to be outed as such and make the climb
to go wrong but be careful the path is
meant to be an ordeal the fight was an
acceptable that's a good thing
absolutely SF partment no apps
absolutely further up somewhere ins the
stuff stuff that was happening a long
time ago
if you see her would you tell her who
doesn't love a good morning yes she was
right voice again so it's this is all
good things and obviously this is just
the first wave and that's why that's why
we're getting one right after another is
just boom boom boom is because this is
the first wave and now people will feel
comfortable talking about it publically
and so there won't be there won't be
that that giant push that there is now
because there is so many people telling
so many stories that it's it's
overwhelming it's incredibly
overwhelming but we just got to listen
we're just gonna listen people the
floodgates exactly leftover beefcake the
floodgates they be open
and I'm not I'm not here to tell you
that you can't like someone because of
something they did in the past that's up
to you that's up to you and how you
handle how you handle the the
entertainment you enjoy you know for me
it does affect me I what we talked about
this the other day with you know Woody
Allen movies that affects me I can't I
cannot watch Woody Allen movies with the
same joy that I used to oh there's a
snap and it's probably going to be the
same for someone like Kevin Spacey or
louis c.k or one of the other you know
hundreds of people who have been accused
recently don't you think there will be
some false accusations there could be I
think the the difference is any anyone
who has been accused it's either
something we've all heard before and
assumed we're false as etiquette
accusations and then you know so many
people come forward that it's not
feasible anymore
and so yeah there it's possible there
could be false accusations that should
not stop anyone from believing a victim
we need to make sure that victims feel
that they can speak out because that's
how you stop predators and if it turns
out it was a false accusation then we
deal with that but so far so far so good
which is a terrible thing to say
yeah so far so good was not the correct
thing to say so I mean so far when it
has come on I mean I remember people
writing stuff like these accusations
about louis c.k are not new people were
writing about this ages ago but there
was no confirmation to be had and now
there's enough people coming forward
while we're getting that kind of
confirmation where now it's almost like
oh design idiot before for not believing
this said some shit and that's
oh yeah no Mel Mel Gibson was a dickhead
and now he's back he didn't hurt anybody
he just said Dickon things we need we
need fire
what about Bush Senior bush seniors an
interesting case Bush senior's a really
interesting case because everyone who's
accusing him is just like ah he patted
me on the butt and he's a man in a
wheelchair and that's kind of round his
height and I'm not sure if what he did
like and he's also a senile old man and
so like that is actually more gray area
for me
I see we set up a little fire trap for
this uh snap mob yeah you're still
streaming what are you talking about oh
you know just some light-hearted talk
about people accused of sexual assault
NBD
this must be the ruin while I was
talking about deep din
what is that
wait come get me can I get me
get me come get me
no no no I thought he went down I
thought he went down
oh shit
that nice critical strike thing when I
knocked him down sigh and trying to
knock him down over and over again and I
have a thing where my my my heart harsh
attack knocks him down more easily
which is why I'm coming in for the
physicals access it
nice nice
got one got one look shit there's a
third one there's a perfect shit shit
everything's fine create more fire traps
please
what it is
my firetrap give him a firetrap
fuck you yeah
yeah dick you dick you robo dick
everything's gonna be fine guys
everything's gonna be fine
but will it I don't know
okay we got we got that we just got one
more didn't we
wasn't there one more oh yeah there is
these everything's fine we leveled up

oh I completely forgot how to go into
slo-mo mode by the way
and I just remembered how to do that you
have to actually press another button to
go into slo-mo mode
ally-gator son of gator absolutely time
to replay this tutorial sometimes that's
the problem with with taking such a long
break from games is you just you forget
all of the forget all of the important
stuff like how to go into slow-mo that's
dumb ah that's super dumb but hey I
still made it just Jack being Jack it's
I think we figured out I haven't played
this since February guys it has been a
long time since I have played this game
I will get to this fire and then we'll
call it there's a bonfire somewhere
around here
there it is I see
what do you think about the Pirates of
the Caribbean movies and the first one
was kind of cute and then I got over it
real fast real fast have you seen the
last one no I just I I think I literally
only saw the first one oh no nice price
on the first three the first one was all
right it was kind of cute and then it
was the joke just got a little too super
fast so I got done I got done I got done
I was done with it all oh so many
cracking of the knuckles all right I got
a call that I got a call this morning
thank you all for hanging out with me
this morning I really appreciate it
sorry we could not stream last night at
our normal times but hey we did it
we're here played some horizons here
done so now is the time in which we
thank all the people who subscribed to
us me during this stream I gave a tip or
did you thank you for letting me know
before we leave true blue review says hi
Jack what do you think of doom and
Skyrim getting ported to the switc seems
like the main selling point for them are
being portable but is it worth three
buying especially with dues downgrade
re-buying is the important question like
for me I am NOT going to read by doom
for the switch even though I could
because technically I played doom on the
Xbox which I no longer have
so I'm actually might buy it on the
switch just to play it again
is it worth 3 buying no if you already
have it on the PC there's no reason to
get it on the switch even though mobile
gaming skyrim maybe right this is one of
those things
it's one of those things where how much
game time are you gonna get out of it
for me
stardew valley was worth Reeb iong
because i knew i was going to get enough
hours to make it worth it
I might rebuy doom for the switch more
Somoza just to see what's all about but
if I'm gonna rebuy doom I might also
want another PC just to play with a
mouse for once that could be kind of fun
you know it's one of those things come
and get back up a couple come back don't
forget the hidden costs you need an
extra SD card for the larger games well
I assume doom is getting a physical
release right I was sooo fun in any case
is it worth it what do you already have
du monde you already have it on the PC
it's gonna look significantly worse and
be harder to play because you're playing
it with a controller button but you can
play it while going to the bathrooms
Yeah right okay so let's get to with
thinking of subscribers these are the
people who have subscribed during this
very stream much like Star Horrible's

months in a row who says 35 months
that's like seven years or something
total lamer who says anytime you load a
save after you beat it it always starts
