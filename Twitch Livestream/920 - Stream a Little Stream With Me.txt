[B] Oh slightly you can't hide behind that
good that's it buddy you've got a little
monster breathing hard grab this before
I forgot about that
my plate last time
now
you'll be able to put his sorry creator
of a breath into the truck
no problem perfect see that's a big WOW
I don't teach that pitiful goop sack to
slime
paving and by extension II perhaps the
place sitting disturbed still pretty
much ready full go for the Rodriguez
blowout ballroom
did you see the reveal Cooper Jason and
the Jason X map for 5:15 no I did not
seems to be your problem thanks to me I
figure they're gonna pull that out of
there but sooner or later recruit here
the festivities can now proceed in an
entirely ghost-free environment so
you're welcome and to the Rodriguez hola
hi I'm from the ghost busters nice of
you guys to join us you grab the little
spud ray we need to have a heart to blob
talk with this health robots are a bit
of a disappointment kidding that's under
mark that's that's exactly what I was
expecting for their single-player
content play look let the nice thing
about the Friday the 13th single-player
BOTS as dumb as they may be is just
getting to do the fun Jason kills and
that's that's fine that's what I expect
nice screaming
look at that trap lousy ghosts
yes
all right again when I was younger
thank Minh used to be my favorite but
now that I'm older
like like rainy gone more
why try it again
that wasn't such a sure now was it nice
no he's a straight man but I love
Winston so much I'm not all alike and
Winston I never said I disliked
Winston's character no need to worry sir
as you know the mayor Road to office on
a strictly Pro Ghostbusters platform we
now invoice the city directly for all
captures and eliminations and unhaunted
New York is a tourist friendly New York
no but damage the mayor in the city have
taken out an extensive insurance policy
as well so you're covered honestly I'm
sensing some hostility here perhaps we
should just leave the ghost here
that's where you would prefer sir fill
this game one does a great deal of
camaraderie count discrete god this
Russian is our prefer loitering that the
cartoon crater would Slimer is a friend
and Ally ah I suppose we should go after
him unless you want to discuss it first
Slimer was was on the and the cartoons
I'm it was on the border of being an
entertainer German on the border
certainly by the time they did the
Slimer cartoon-like on his own he was he
was in full scrappydew territory the
Slimer solo adventures
registered you see the new design of the
millennium why do you care about this
stupid movie
yeah they redesigned the Falcon so they
could sell the toys or maybe they just
felt like doing it it doesn't really
matter
what if we did I know I'm spoke I know
I'm supposed to go the other I just
don't forget about this thing
this section here is actually probably a
pretty decent candidate for me dying if
I died this early I'll probably just
restart
these guys knocked me down there's none
of the other ghostbusters around to pick
me up
let's do some upgrading
shit
what
I think I survived where's jack he went
to do holiday stuff he may never return
he'll be back
I didn't - masseter wish I wish the
Dodge were a bit more responsive than
this I had a complaint that would be
Eddie
good work you all did enrich finish this
game earlier but now I'm trying to do it
without dying might really be the right
person for this job yes you have
destroyed a significant section of a
five-star New York hotel in just under
three hours your mother and I are so
proud play Gears of War it's like this
but better controls and no jokes well it
it doesn't have better controls because
you can't play it with a mouse
some type of lighting focused at the
market animator to be what you familiar
objects which selfless and materially
manifest strange
the latest gears came out on Windows but
the latest gears is too boring
really lame enemies in the new year
the whole long section we're fighting
the drones and gears for pure ass pure
ass
only trap
forks whine at me but when knives and
forks become a big angry giant that's
really me not liking it a lot happens
every day right anybody here from said
amore but first I was I either but we
had to make do with this new specimen
here
turbo Jesus 5,000 you might add about
her earlier this game is not on Steam
anymore but I have not tested this
supposedly I have read you can still buy
a digital version of this game for the
PC on gamestop on their website on
GameStop's website especially you can
still redeem that on Steam but the key
they give you so you might still be able
to buy this game and stop it that cheap
confection rape weren't you gonna finish
up the install of the super slammer
today and exciting I mean against the
minions of God I have not tested if this
works maybe on Travis maybe you can
download it but you can't get a nun
Steam and it's a weird version that
doesn't work I don't I don't know
anything about that guys don't know I'm
just read this as a thing who can do
what are we the FDA will have to clear a
path through this mess first
yet booming this residue is animating
Geordie help us stay up to somehow
hatching these many minions for
themselves
well there's paranormal physiology for
you
rich supply of the next voice actor of
Mickey Mouse
Cooper swept thro obligation capture the
slammer
you can relinquish
I'd read it in when you were alive
you're worse
No
what's it
this particular ghosts are very
dangerous
you're only encouraging them Faceman we
need to have a talk about holler oh god
I so should have dodged that
Oh
f13 I'll play Friday the 13th forbid if
I'd died in this is that it's not too
late
sad mark hamill mark hamill was a man
who was worried about his legacy he was
Luke Skywalker in the best movie he ever
made and I'm sure he's terribly worried
about the poor reception of the last
Jedi has gotten amongst many of the fans
that's the Star Wars that that's what
he's gonna be fuckin were known for
forever and I was in the seminary goes
he doesn't want to sully that what
I'm
Tim lousy hobo ghosts
can't lose Winston
yeah
if I'd died which came in like at a
switch - you're assuming a lot further
2772 six I'm back after my sabbatical
hello everyone we need to find a witch's
mess get anything good for Christmas I
got stabbed and also got a new headset
and keyboard really I got I got some
Super Mario Brothers one fridge magnets
nobody knows what the hell to get me for
Christmas
apparently I'm really hard to shop for
AJ pimp souls is hey rich glad to see
you streaming once more before the end
of the year the other day you said
Elle's best of the worst was your
favorite what's your favorite random
arlynn vid fiction vid been hurt and
yeah hurt do we call that video Ben
wrote another way you talkin about
etc it's probably still the oldest one
look a lot of it was because I was there
and I remember how fun it was having
that discussion so I'm biased but I
still gotta give it to who's the old
Santa Claus National Lampoon's Christmas
vacation to video that's a sabbatical
it's like a vacation like a long
vacation
100% of the event and I will 100% need
that I said way back nicely done
great job kid yeah combustible gasoline
it's the future Egon once again on the
super slammer I before it's a prototype
Peter you recall the memo from you about
getting too many memos on prototypes
well I did right there we mounted a high
expansion rapid cycle multiple post
absorber it's faster and larger than
okay okay potentially but our exposure
to interdimensional deities has been
only marginal today so it would be wise
to anticipate some error
we should type elephants somebody needs
to go
I got places to go people to me we get
out of here
Hindenburg opera wasn't that show shut
down when the stage caught fire and
killed the cast I didn't really like the
low speed and chase in the space but I
like the movie overall alright I didn't
particularly love the movie overall but
I don't I don't understand what's
inherently so bad about the the slow
space chase plot oh my God we're gonna
run out of gas that's that's a very real
threat and making them run out of gas
was a valid military tactic black slime
black slime is a hazardous form of
ectoplasmic residue toxic to both body
and soul characters whirring a lot of
fuel when a Star Wars movie is beard
yeah weird and boots sufficient enough
to insulate against the Star Wars is a
shitty universe and when you would try
to apply logic to it it falls apart
the first order could have just warped
ahead of them and cut them off yeah but
they didn't have to in fact in family
warping ahead to cut them off okay if if
the first order worked a few ships I had
to cut them off they would have they
would have forced a battle to happen and
that might have incurred some losses on
the new orders part but if they just
hang back and let them run out of fuel
they just pick them off when they're
sitting there like like big ducks they
don't they don't lose any Thai fighters
they don't risk losing a big capital
ship and an engagement the first order
strategy there made sense
that's not defending the movie I didn't
really like the movie that much but I
will defend their tactics in that
particular situation
you want it back Peter you better take
what's that supposed to mean I'm a
chubby chaser take out one month girl a
blind date
like of personalities and you guys

[C] just did a service to humanity kids
Hindenburg's a turrible
doesn't this game suck major balls no
this game is great
kyla was already done more than Vader
ever could well yeah but the ending of
the last Jedi when he stopped everything
he was doing to attack Luke when
everything he had made him look like the
biggest idiot in the world in into the
galaxy so now your villain for the last
movie of the trilogy is the biggest
idiot in the galaxy in the end of at the
end of the film the last Jedi did kylo
Ren no favors and we all right support
looks like it's me and you let's go
across Times Square and get into the
building Stay Puft is so interested in
you guys I don't even know what the
stories are I'm not hanging out at like
Star Wars forums or something to hear
kylo Ren memes
keep away from those feet he'll stop you
into jelly
Lozano loosen them up
do the trick
nice boson that really dindim great job
now see if he wants more
here he comes
you say something movers stick close to
me and as far away from him as you can
gotta distract them
thank when are you getting coffee
Beckman's getting coffee
Bulls on guards
with boson guards
that's right whoops
there's our weigh-in break for it
ghostbusters just a level-five platform
cross rip the professionals are here
everybody calm weird the idea of a giant
marshmallow man come from dan aykroyd
brain it's a terribly weird place come
on we've got to get to the top floors
which is playing ghostbusters again yes
sorry to disappoint you but not really
that sorry I'm playing I'm playing with
a mission
let's stay in for lunch you said 5:00 in
the building you said it'll be quiet you
said you know you're fine you're right I
secretly knew our lives would be in
danger and thought hey I'll make sure I
trap mark with me inside an elevator
stay with me Hoss I'm sure there's more
fun up ahead
oh no sudden movements these are the
Rando guy and this is the
player-character the the nameless fifth
Ghostbuster who doesn't say anything and
keeps quiet and stays out of the way
while the cast you like does their thing
it lets you participate while also just
being the audience it's fine moving the
fifth nameless Ghostbuster it was a wise
choice
working overtime generating these little
treats
alright busting makes me feel good
someone needs a Ghostbuster
Beckmann come in please pandamonium up
here chunks of the building missing
everywhere you are required at the site
now did I mention there's a
spectacularly beautiful lady in distress
easy now mister just relax no sudden
movements you're perfectly safe now
Wow check it out kid what a few huh
Manhattan I love it
nothing to worry about folks what would
happen if the ghostbusters cross streams
against Godzilla this radiation atomic
breath the atomic breath would probably
still incinerate them you're fine
you didn't spill your coffee did you
Peter ray I got coffee for all of us but
the little monster spilled it
and what's the story with those things
anyway they're cool to see you speedrun
transformers devastation on the street I
can also fall asleep on stream it just
maybe would you like to take the most
direct route out of here or the scenic
route it's lady's choice
there's a stairwell over here that game
is the definition of minimal effort yeah
grace under pressure I appreciate that
in a lady okay slugger lets you and me
do this quick and quiet before tubby
soft squeeze up there figures out what
we're up to squeeze his dog ears ray
well it was a good plan for a second
okay
let's think what did people do before
stairs
was it ladders or just jumping from
watch Stay Puft spotted us
wait well--that's come on let's go
why does this game literally ten hours
long because that's how long the game is
I'm not not quite sure what you're
planning about or if that's even a
complain there that's just a weird
statement
cry haunting that box for a while hey
over here
we
all right you're gonna first fucking
oh you prick
Wow
what
strong signal
do I think I would be playing the
upcoming spider-man ps4 game I might
have to certainly not looking forward to
it
that's how you do it great job I'm
expecting a lot of scripted
hey rain Saints reading
size of your finger knock you off the
side of the 30-story building you had to
climb all the way back up
how mad would you be at those three
though thinking I'd go with mighty
pissed Rowena shoot that giant blue and
white toy man thing or whatever is still
coming it's climbing the building
I'm impressed with his agility
considering his complete
Hey did somebody tell you was breaking
no sweat kid we've got you about logic
down did you save to get back off mister
sweetie
I'll write there sunshine are you okay
you're all strapped in we've got a good
tight trim on your belt here he comes
many generate from 200,000 square feet
of solid marshmallow
hold on dogs should do the trick
does that least upset look what do you
think is the whole game Marshmallow Man
no just the sequence
stop up with your boson darts
got him on the ropes watcher
easy easy
oh that just them that fancy name the
game you could do up a little surge that
goes to the proton stream does a a
little bit of explosive damage he's that
you're driving through I'm assuming Dan
Akroyd named it for Red Dead Redemption
- I haven't seen that much of it yet so
we'll see I've seen one trailer for all
I can say about red redemption - Red
Dead Redemption - is so far who I assume
is the protagonist looks like kind of an
asshole I'll probably miss John Marston
but we'll see it says dear mr. Richard
Evans
what would Picard do if the enterprise
accidentally tunneled into the Star Wars
universe what would his methods be of
both survival and communication it would
probably handle it in a in a logical
manner but I I might have there's
probably been a number of different
people who've done videos on this but I
saw one person who actually they're
really a really good hypothetical
Starfleet versus the the Empire here's a
video what if the wormhole from deep
space 9 opened up to the Star Wars
universe and it was actually well
thought out and not just fanboy
masturbation it actually probably would
have made a good story I like I said
that can be misleading this is probably
like 80 different videos like what
happened but I saw one specific one I'll
have the track down which one it was
that I thought was really well thought
out
well thought out yes it was well thought
out fanboy masturbation then I thought
hypothetically would have made a good
like a good season of deep space 9 a
good story and the Star Wars universe
well you know none of the Star Wars fans
that gentleman was all me and I can
assure you it was not an oversight oh by
the way you have visitors thanks Jeanie
your first class look out Walter Peck I
did not recognize you without the
mayor's backs I detest fear knows
well not everything from Star Trek is
better than Star Wars just look at the
TNG films as an example well that's
certainly true look I will still say
that Empire Strikes Back is one of the
best films ever made
I just think Star Wars should have
stopped after Return of the Jedi
those are manifested in a familiar form
one he had used before the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man but this event was
weaker than his first encounter with us
or he'll versus Star Wars I would I
would I would gladly trade all future
Star Wars movies every single one they
might make in the future for another
season of the Orval your business get
some county and state work I like the
movies I just think the universe is crap
I don't need to the Star Wars universe
peacock pea COC paranormal contracts
Mike and Jay will make you see them
anyway that's true there's going to be
suspending you clowns
lighten up pack launch your
investigation if you have to but for now
just keep them under control and my
office in the loop but remember if the
Ghostbusters universe could be as rich
as they wanted to make it in my opinion
the problem is they seem to feel like
they have to play it safe by only two
sticking to stuff with me whether the
problem with that is that every time
Star Wars hasn't played it safe it's
been a disaster every time just about
think the sad thing is those things you
know are the only things that work which
is why I'm saying they don't need to
make any more it's done doesn't pack
look exactly like the kind of guy who'd
accidentally walk into the stream of a
bosun glider I'm just saying it could
happen as rich played either coat or you
mean a role-playing game in a universe I
don't like sign me up I hate the Jedi I
despise them the reason I like Luke
being anti guy in the last Jedi is
because I fully agree with that position
alright I've got you down for then Ren
I've been talking and we think we should
have a look at the museum whatever
happened tonight but rich you're gonna
be anti Jedi in those do you mean sis
stay with you listen you guys they're
both assholes crew I'll be your personal
protection
what about pic he's supposed to be
informed of everything we do but he
doesn't know can't hurt us
like if you're worried about me playing
kotor on stream don't worry
I'm not going
you could probably do dark forces though
it's just doing pretty okay fine I don't
I don't mind the Dark Horse's games
everybody knows I like TIE fighter I
never really played the original
ex-player I couldn't get into it because
TIE fighter was so much better I did
play the game after that x-plane
Alliance thought that was alright and
then I played dark forces I liked it at
the time I don't know that it's aged
quite so well dark forces that's
probably fine I've played it in a while
Jedi Knight I think that game aged like
crap certainly visually but I think Jedi
Outcast the third dark forces game is a
fine and fun game to this day and it
helps a lot that the main character in
those games Kyle Katarn is not a qui-gon
style prequel Jedi because then I would
be vomiting a couple of class 5
animators I've never seen him in tandem
like that they're really agitated
like even even in return to the jive
when Luke was going into full I'm a Jedi
mode he like lost every bit of
personality and likeability Luke had I'm
a Jedi like my father before me like
like being a Jedi just made blue flame
Winston check that next door we see if
he has any friends leave a haunted room
I've got no problem with that
hey cadet to use the shock blaster it's
best to get in fairly close its effects
are powerful but dissipate quickly over
distance and please be careful it's a
prototype we're trusting you with it the
stasis stream will temporarily slowed
down paranormal entities if you train
the Sun think about it Jedi Knight was
quake Jedi Knight had its own engine you
use it it was not it was not built often
in technology be originally the first
Jedi name I've been conducting an
experiment in which I sleep in average
14 minutes a day leaves me a lot of time
to work great ready to roll
hey Hoss you think you can handle that
little fella yourself we'll meet you
back here
