[A] all right I have better slappy strengths
and I've got a better slappy plan
where is it specifically I think it's
over here Oh No fuck's sake
magazine drinking which importantly
means I will no longer throw up when
drinking too much turned around I mean
it'd be good all right all right I don't
rich why don't you drink in real life
I'm I'm uncomfortable with with a
chemical altering my brain I'm very
uncomfortable with this
did I ever drink in the past no I never
felt the urge I don't really need the
leadership book
not really I'm gonna need the extra
firepower yeah we're DS bad to the
breaks
wait actually do kind of want the
leadership er
changing my mind why are people obsessed
with my not drinking to be fair it is
kind of weird in the grand scheme of
things
want this leadership book but there's
nothing I want to put down to get it
rather have the bat for this fight but
the bat was about to break near by the
punching the flaming the boxing gloves
the the best weapon I could think of to
grab than I I knew where the do the the
right ingredients were to make it
nope that's what I want
I know I'm trying to I know the boxing
glove and bowie knife is fairly good
pretty good for bosses it's so good for
bosses I'm trying to avoid using them
feel sorry for sloppy yeah kind of
he thinks he's killing the guy who
started the outbreak take a break my run
continues well I'm gonna yeah I took a
bathroom break at the very least
here we go here we go
nope
I missed
how'd that kill him last time how did he
kill me last time I i completely forgot
that you could stun lock him with the
jump kick strats I I clean forgot I went
and played around with the the game when
I went home after I failed I I reloaded
the same with slappy and I jumped kicked
him and he knocked and he fell down and
it just it just all fucking came back to
me alright you can jump kick slappy and
just keep him down I felt so stupid
after I remembered that
yeah we've already saved Jack in this
game
it's done
yes it's a dildo
whereas my foot so nervous because I
fiddle constantly and you know this
about me everyone knows this about me
and there
all right doing pretty good
I check time one more time oh I get it I
get it you pervs
side-missions available here alright
we're on top of everything
feels like I'm missing a Zombrex feels
like I grab the three in the casino sure
you could ask this lap but would you
ever consider playing Knights of the Old
Republic one or two I am just completely
not interested
burned out man not so much burned out
it's just I haven't I haven't liked all
Star Wars all that much since the late
90s what I ever consider playing
injustice to yes but I'd probably want
to play injustice one first
all right what are we what are we doing
what are we working on as well I may as
well do the little casino I mean a
little pawn shop quest thing
they get the combo card for money
sledgehammer ax I'd like to not build a
combo weapon unless I got the card for
it but if I don't get that ax thing soon
fuckin
I'm gonna need that later
yes the Defiler is the proper name of
the weapon I'm calling it the
sledgehammer axe I'm sorry I'm so
fucking sorry for your loss your
personal individual loss
I have no what I were to double check
maybe just went by it
Defiler pepper Hecker
hell-blade oh no why this is the driller
oh I do
oh okay sweet
pawnshop ever worth it I mean I'm here I
may as well unlock it yeah why not
plus I'm gonna read
and it shows up as a quest on there it
feels like something I should do and so
I did it
make it look easy make it look easy
alright I'm gonna take a potty break
I'll be back I will be back
so I grabbed some Chewbacca cheez-its
because I needed something to snack on
they they have little pictures of Star
Wars shits on the cheez-its
look at this
I have no idea if that showed up on
camera probably didn't but I had a
little picture of r2d2 on it it's
getting chroma keyed weird just wired a
few I thought you'd be interested in the
absurdity of Star Wars characters on a
chizel
well I tried all right I know didn't
show up I'm sorry I tried

[B] okay they're stars there all right got a
killed I'm gonna kill time I'll make it
to file her and they'll grab some more
Zombrex for Katie and I got to drop some
of these books
what don't I need leadership
I don't need leadership I just don't
need it and that's the book that is
right yeah all right I can grab another
one if I need it okay good good good
there's no time to kill maybe a little
killer
Farah we needed Dead Rising 2 now I'd
say over half but not far over half
we're close to half
like and I think coming up that I'm
dreading the poker match less so that
something could go wrong and more so
just I you just run it a bad luck
I have little control whether or not I
run into some really bad luck
and then I can't save those three take
the plunge
all right yes Dead Rising 4 is absolute
garbage
oh wait that's not what I need that's
what I did
whoops whoops
maps are good maps are good useful
things
sounds like the dudes who made Dead
Rising 4 or getting laid off maybe it
means good things for the French guys
that means they're gonna stop making
games in the franchise is what it means
franchise dead
so no way to get downstairs to the
tunnels
a wall I guess there isn't
oh that's behind there all right all
right
why are these women still working
yeah I'm leveled up that's what matters
man man where this where the stairs back
that way
dedicated to do do do do do do do do do
this is what I'm trying to find reason I
came down here so I could grab this am I
gonna watch the Olympics well if this
raid probably not tonight
what do we drop I guess the answer has
to be there
right on all right
and we're off
I really need one of these one of these
level ups to expand my pockets I need
bigger pockets
don't recall saying this boss being
fought on stream probably you probably
haven't seen this boss bought on stream
I'm farther than I've ever been on
stream
his weak spot is shooting him in the
crotch when he's taunting you
you may now kiss the bride
Oh shucks you and your one-liners when
something terrible happens to people
you're such a sociopath but you've got a
daughter
Chuck's fine Chuck rains fine you can by
the way after you beat him you can use
this chainsaw
unfortunately it sucks oh I feel dirty
I got nothing I got nothing else armored
with them so it's too early for the one
guy
I'm too early like Randy would have been
ah yeah wait four minutes for this guy
to show up cause the time of the casino
stick to me wait there
what didn't mean hit you
you go there
all right that's enough later on I had
some a shot all right all right we're
good

to leveling up
