[A] all right I have better slappy strengths
and I've got a better slappy plan
where is it specifically I think it's
over here Oh No fuck's sake
magazine drinking which importantly
means I will no longer throw up when
drinking too much turned around I mean
it'd be good all right all right I don't
rich why don't you drink in real life
I'm I'm uncomfortable with with a
chemical altering my brain I'm very
uncomfortable with this
did I ever drink in the past no I never
felt the urge I don't really need the
leadership book
not really I'm gonna need the extra
firepower yeah we're DS bad to the
breaks
wait actually do kind of want the
leadership er
changing my mind why are people obsessed
with my not drinking to be fair it is
kind of weird in the grand scheme of
things
want this leadership book but there's
nothing I want to put down to get it
rather have the bat for this fight but
the bat was about to break near by the
punching the flaming the boxing gloves
the the best weapon I could think of to
grab than I I knew where the do the the
right ingredients were to make it
nope that's what I want
I know I'm trying to I know the boxing
glove and bowie knife is fairly good
pretty good for bosses it's so good for
bosses I'm trying to avoid using them
feel sorry for sloppy yeah kind of
he thinks he's killing the guy who
started the outbreak take a break my run
continues well I'm gonna yeah I took a
bathroom break at the very least
here we go here we go
nope
I missed
how'd that kill him last time how did he
kill me last time I i completely forgot
that you could stun lock him with the
jump kick strats I I clean forgot I went
and played around with the the game when
I went home after I failed I I reloaded
the same with slappy and I jumped kicked
him and he knocked and he fell down and
it just it just all fucking came back to
me alright you can jump kick slappy and
just keep him down I felt so stupid
after I remembered that
yeah we've already saved Jack in this
game
it's done
yes it's a dildo
whereas my foot so nervous because I
fiddle constantly and you know this
about me everyone knows this about me
and there
all right doing pretty good
I check time one more time oh I get it I
get it you pervs
side-missions available here alright
we're on top of everything
feels like I'm missing a Zombrex feels
like I grab the three in the casino sure
you could ask this lap but would you
ever consider playing Knights of the Old
Republic one or two I am just completely
not interested
burned out man not so much burned out
it's just I haven't I haven't liked all
Star Wars all that much since the late
90s what I ever consider playing
injustice to yes but I'd probably want
to play injustice one first
all right what are we what are we doing
what are we working on as well I may as
well do the little casino I mean a
little pawn shop quest thing
they get the combo card for money
sledgehammer ax I'd like to not build a
combo weapon unless I got the card for
it but if I don't get that ax thing soon
fuckin
I'm gonna need that later
yes the Defiler is the proper name of
the weapon I'm calling it the
sledgehammer axe I'm sorry I'm so
fucking sorry for your loss your
personal individual loss
I have no what I were to double check
maybe just went by it
Defiler pepper Hecker
hell-blade oh no why this is the driller
oh I do
oh okay sweet
pawnshop ever worth it I mean I'm here I
may as well unlock it yeah why not
plus I'm gonna read
and it shows up as a quest on there it
feels like something I should do and so
I did it
make it look easy make it look easy
alright I'm gonna take a potty break
I'll be back I will be back
so I grabbed some Chewbacca cheez-its
because I needed something to snack on
they they have little pictures of Star
Wars shits on the cheez-its
look at this
I have no idea if that showed up on
camera probably didn't but I had a
little picture of r2d2 on it it's
getting chroma keyed weird just wired a
few I thought you'd be interested in the
absurdity of Star Wars characters on a
chizel
well I tried all right I know didn't
show up I'm sorry I tried

[B] okay they're stars there all right got a
killed I'm gonna kill time I'll make it
to file her and they'll grab some more
Zombrex for Katie and I got to drop some
of these books
what don't I need leadership
I don't need leadership I just don't
need it and that's the book that is
right yeah all right I can grab another
one if I need it okay good good good
there's no time to kill maybe a little
killer
Farah we needed Dead Rising 2 now I'd
say over half but not far over half
we're close to half
like and I think coming up that I'm
dreading the poker match less so that
something could go wrong and more so
just I you just run it a bad luck
I have little control whether or not I
run into some really bad luck
and then I can't save those three take
the plunge
all right yes Dead Rising 4 is absolute
garbage
oh wait that's not what I need that's
what I did
whoops whoops
maps are good maps are good useful
things
sounds like the dudes who made Dead
Rising 4 or getting laid off maybe it
means good things for the French guys
that means they're gonna stop making
games in the franchise is what it means
franchise dead
so no way to get downstairs to the
tunnels
a wall I guess there isn't
oh that's behind there all right all
right
why are these women still working
yeah I'm leveled up that's what matters
man man where this where the stairs back
that way
dedicated to do do do do do do do do do
this is what I'm trying to find reason I
came down here so I could grab this am I
gonna watch the Olympics well if this
raid probably not tonight
what do we drop I guess the answer has
to be there
right on all right
and we're off
I really need one of these one of these
level ups to expand my pockets I need
bigger pockets
don't recall saying this boss being
fought on stream probably you probably
haven't seen this boss bought on stream
I'm farther than I've ever been on
stream
his weak spot is shooting him in the
crotch when he's taunting you
you may now kiss the bride
Oh shucks you and your one-liners when
something terrible happens to people
you're such a sociopath but you've got a
daughter
Chuck's fine Chuck rains fine you can by
the way after you beat him you can use
this chainsaw
unfortunately it sucks oh I feel dirty
I got nothing I got nothing else armored
with them so it's too early for the one
guy
I'm too early like Randy would have been
ah yeah wait four minutes for this guy
to show up cause the time of the casino
stick to me wait there
what didn't mean hit you
you go there
all right that's enough later on I had
some a shot all right all right we're
good
fuck you gotta be careful really close
to leveling up
wait there
nobody has yet died on an escort mission
whoo
it's impossible to be doing too good
who are you my name is rich Evans what
welcome
Oh Jackson the chat you're asking
previously recorded live who they were
yes jack is in the chat now apparently
Jack what's up what's up man I'm doing
great
wicked
I know you guys are gonna hate this but
I'm gonna check my cheat sheet and make
sure I'm not missing anybody
I'm gonna use my cheat sheet
she's not there yet
all right
where are we at I just have a list here
of when survivors spawn and when they
asked for requests just because I really
don't want to fucking miss anything now
I never got that call about Lynette why
why or not Lynette or what's her name
though the one with the golf club you
don't know you've never seen her before
I know who it is though there she is
just a few other things before okay keep
that book yeah okay so talking about
thinking to myself why don't you dress
up the character cuz I like looking
silly Hey looking sillies for nerds
your weapons break in this game yes
keep moving
all right the Flint around
I know looter zombies ever that's a good
question
you think you think a few of them would
have gotten taken down by the zombies
don't talk to you I already talked to
you I know what you saying god damn toys
no she's got her models
nope no Lenny isn't here yet

[C] I found all the possible toys I'm only
missing one thing I can't get it to
later
we may as well do Stuart's scheme now
before you forget is that would be bad
those are mute this is our mutiny event
here
Stuart threatens to leave we just talked
him down it's no problem unless you
forget about it then it's a problem
excuse me
yes Stewart is always trying to ruin
things
there's something wrong with Stuart yeah
he he wants to he doesn't like you and
he's gonna leave with some other people
I haven't been reading I forgot why so I
got to convince him not to leave with
other people and get all those other
people killed because Stuart's and
dipshit
look up yes to is a greedy half cycle
that is that's pretty accurate yeah
can I just kill him I can't use weapons
in the safehouse
I wouldn't do it anyway come on
what happens if you don't talk to him he
leaves and he brings other survivors
with them and they count as being dead
and I will have failed in my attempt to
save everybody that's what I think
happens
I don't think Stewart's ever had
successfully had a mutiny I'm eight so
I'm assuming it's like the mutinies in
Dead Rising 1 which may be a mistake
did I get to slap yet oh I fucking tore
slappy apart I made slap you look like a
fucking joke
yeah
uh what do I need I need to go this way
yike yike
but you're you a full-time streamer I
wouldn't say full-time streamer mostly
I'm doing red letter media related stuff
I'm gonna like an hour to kill in this
game I'm gonna double-check make sure
I'm not missing something I understand
I've got too much time to kill man and
it feels weird no I'm I'm good I'm good
and half an hour ass not that much time
welljust will just get in the vicinity
of where we need to be how about that
psycho prep I think I'm good I think I'm
good
well I got four combo cards I don't I
don't have a great strategy for this
next two upcoming fight I think I tried
flamethrowers once I was underwhelmed
I'm gonna say we're good with what I got
what's the next fight you'll see you'll
see
about a half an hour in game time away
from it so I went from thinking I was
behind to killing time
hmm
hmm
probably
do I ever use the bees I may once or
twice they're not that useful in this
particular game
told you they weren't nice ladies
part is great for freedom bear hmm-hmm
never thought to try that particular
Strad I should be alright
this outbreak is killing thousands
people are dying
Oh
all right
no I don't want thank you no stop stop I
don't want to god damn it that was an
accident
so not a bad strap
quick-step
and painkiller nice combo for this fight
feels like I'm wasting health but I'm a
quick tank
quick-step is worn off
fuck
magic work
OOP well you only have to kill one of
them
you will never get out of here alive
Chuck we promise you that
picking up the drinking magazine was a
godsend said this battle is specifically
why I picked that up Chuck was actually
caring about someone dying and no one
lighter I know this game has gone off
the rails
Oh
what
got that drop that I want the fire
extinction
not anything you think we got everything
we need
I really should make some more help now
that's the quickest route probably left
what
how am i how am i I'm fine absolutely
fine
ah it's maddening
nope don't mean to do that
actually I already gave her one of these
bearers I'm doing something different
with this
we're not quite ready for this yet
yes
I'm gonna come back for I need to get
some health ready
Oh
okay okay
now we're off to our next boss fight
what difficulty is this as far as I know
this game doesn't have difficulty
settings I'm gonna try this freedom bear
here we'll see how this works probably
poorly
hey buddy I don't think there's anyone
there what's cheese castle the cheese
castle is a tourist trap right over the
Wisconsin border because Wisconsin
Wisconsin cheese place called the cheese
castle they go there they sell a bunch
cheese did you come over the border to
Wisconsin you think I want some of that
famous Wisconsin cheese look this place
called the cheese castle finds like the
same voice sound to a slappy probably is
it's a nice place the cheese castle I've
been in there Karen loves it every time
we go by Karen insist on stopping at the
cheese castle
oh it doesn't work
like you follow me I guess it makes
sense
and I made it look easy Chuck I'm trying
not to make the Wolverine gloves because
they're overpowered that's some
challenging myself my daughter
this one's special
all right
he's quickly run over here that's kind
of
did you get destroyed No

[D] shoot freedom bear shoot
oh did I not I didn't activate it last
time that's why I didn't shoot at the
mailman
I don't think I can I'm gonna try I
don't think I can give this to my
daughter
well alright
I don't think she'll take it we'll try
all right Lenny are you there yet Lenny
no no she doesn't take it that's worth
checking out
why does she hate freedom hey you know
what I don't know I don't know why she
hates freedom
goodbye freedom burr I have so much free
time it feels like I'm missing something
but I I'm pretty sure I'm not
uh you guys are gonna have a field day
with this
stick with me
this way keep close
move that way
dignity matters have some fucking
dignity
stick to me
I hope you've had your fun I hope you've
had your fun
I need what are you doing your thing you
have money
we're gonna leave and come back and
hopefully Lenny will have spawned with
this little survivor request if not I've
got to go on with the mission I've got I
got too much shit to do right now in
game hour the period of the game where
we had free time is over
and Lenny really needs to get his shit
together fruit time is over he said
before spending five hours playing poker
with morons but that's that's not free
time though that's submission I need to
do and I need a lot of time for that
because this there's a lot of just
random shit with that Oh Lenny you prick
alright fuck you Lenny
yeah what the fuck is wrong with my
socks No
like if Lenny's there when I get back
I'll do is I'll do a survivor request
but he's out of time oh yeah I got other
things I need to do I drink this orange
juice
Thanks
I don't have the elbow drop yet
walking fucking library I know all Katy
and her fucking Zombrex
yes you can pick up a playboy in
magazine in this game it gives you extra
prestige points for female survivors yes
this is literally an escort mission
they don't come with you unless you give
them $10,000
wait yes I want
wait
most of my inventory his books right now
I I don't regret it
what do you close the fucking doors
alright time for some gambling
so the Plunkett jacket basically it
short sleeves
I'm gonna sit down and play some poker
is that what you wanted there's time
away stand
we need to we need to get lucky yeah six
king the I'll call though
he's probably got ace
yeah yeah yeah I know game I know we're
playing poker just give me the cards two
ones
oh god that's the lowest hand I could
have wonder why I keep losing in this
game
No
somebody go in
why don't I bait them by by just calling
I had the smallest possible raise all
right
all right so the benefit of having the
gambling books here is basically it
guarantees you're gonna have decent
cards but not necessarily better than
there's videos Jack
Oh Jack no
that's a big race
ah Katie needs her son Briggs I'm
fucking poker
I think I need to get aggressive I need
to get aggressive
that's not what I wanted to see fuck it
Katie needs your Zombrex
I know that wasn't necessarily the
smartest play but I'm not a timer here
you know if I don't win they won't
follow me no
just got pockets something I can afford
to call it
now
I call
I race
fuck it what's he got
yeah yeah oh well oh well
why would you all in on that because I'm
trying to i got Katie needs her Sam
Briggs I need to beat these guys before
she dies
yeah
what's the goal though to win to beat
them it's the timer even moving yes it
is I'm pretty sure no I'm pretty sure it
is 25
yeah he's got no okay
nope not okay
I need an ace yeah Oh God what are they
for well they're not force you to play
this game when he raised when he raised
call a six
cinnamon that's the wrong gambling
mission that you're posting that for
that's a knee up which is something
different later on
ace Jack fuck it I'll call that
Oh
that's big race nothing jack

[E] yep that was her bet not mine I folded
I raise
he's almost certainly got a king right
you can't oh one of them will be knocked
out
we're at least nearly backed out
see the Zombrex timer is going down
I know Zombrex is in the red I know I
know this is tense is the biggest thing
I was worried about and I'm doing bad I
was hoping to get them quick
Oh
Oh
yeah the perfect road is coming down to
this yes
Oh
she's gonna win
plus I get really lucky now I won't
so you're playing against AI not people
she went all in with ten to
this is why I was doing some stupid all
ins earlier
hurry up hurry up
right back into it like nothing happened
long as the poker game going on it just
ended
now we got time we got time this
shortcuts gonna take us right near the
dam safe house safe room whatever
who sent what he probably heard wasn't
construction equipment it was probably
snow moving equipment because they're
probably plowing the roads because it's
a fucking awful winter
like all winters
yeah Chad I've been playing since like
2:30 Central Time
oh by the way they're not hookers their
guardian angels personal security they
didn't go there Oh
minute early I'm a minute early for
whatever reason I don't think I'm gonna
get the Lenni mission so it's not gonna
be a 100% ultimate perfect run but I I'm
still on track to save everybody
I'm sorry
there's talk of finding a cure someday
isabella keys was looking for it wasn't
she one of the terrorists and Willem
n-no her brother was the terrorist he
was angry taking revenge for a
government experiment that caused all of
this in the first place
Isabella tried to help she worked with
Frank West to make the first inhibitor
using Queens
well I hope she's still looking
yeah
oh honey there you are it's the guy from
the beginning of the game are we saved
when we got snowflake he decayed her you
know lynnie seif actually miss chuck
saying that i got them together lines
mixed up ladies good pray for Lenny
likes numbers too oh they're doing a
Rain Man Thing Lenny likes counting
numbers are good times Lenny Charlie
kept big numbers in the yucatan casino
so Lenny can come terribly good at sluts
Lenny keeps key safe so Charlie can give
any money later do count let me get any
of the key to the one of the casinos
all right any other missions going on
this one all right all right I can trap
some of these fucking gambling books
just we got some precious fucking
inventory space together
all right
yeah I understand that this is the long
stream if you gotta go you gotta go
good night and thank you for joining us
that gambling was tense hence me and oh
shit yeah I remember what happens later
in this in game day oh we're gonna have
some fun not
the gambling books just for that one
part ah well if I'm trying to do all of
the missions there's a second completely
optional just like the first one really
gambling mission in the safehouse
there's a strip poker game that I can
take part in and that's the one where
for it to count I only need to be at the
table when one of the people are
eliminated what do I do next
what do I do next
order events what's
okay I'm gonna run to that casino vault
real quick
okay okay where's the ball think that's
ever here oh yeah
yeah I totally wanted to pick up that
sign and not open the door how'd you get
that right game while reading my mind
examine I'm examining it interesting
it's not letting me in is there
something I'm missing with this quest is
there something I'm missing
I didn't like forget to pick up a Keith
firm or something did I'm
fuck we're gonna race back real fucking
quick
then jerk Lenny better still be there no
money's not useless now as the rest of
the the rest of the country and the
world are fine this is an isolated
breakout of zombies in this one area
Oh
stress stress so much stress all this
wasted time
other than this Lenny business were
we're pretty
look we're good we're good and I don't
care if I I don't know if I don't do a
little personal request
well I notice I got a ton of money more
than I had after winning the poker game
so maybe it counted as me having done
what I need to do I don't know all right
Lenny oh good it counted
we're just we're stealing money from
mentally incapable man who does not know
any better and we are we are horrible
people in my little survivor notes my I
definitely don't want to forget anything
notes alright so we did Lenny's quest
Lenny's golden okay okay okay
rich has a cheat sheet so he doesn't
miss a survivor and you know what I
don't care if you're okay with that
because I'm okay with that
it's not a walkthrough it's just a list
of times that things are happening
all right so these are the hardest to
find survivors in the game if you didn't
read about these online or see a video
or read a walkthrough about these guys I
don't know how the fuck you would have
found them but in order to start
recruiting them I've got to go do
something I gotta go grab some things
this game really doesn't give you much
time to dilly-dally well you're under no
obligation to try and do everything
which I am doing right now as a personal
challenge like the main story missions
there's so much time in between the main
story stuff it's it's a joke
headache incoming you get the in-game
reward for doing everything just the
experience points for leveling up and no
other than the satisfaction of having
yeah yeah phone I know I know
where's it others
we're to go House beard all right
quickest way into safer to avoid the
snipers until I'm ready for him I
dropped it
oh shit
thank you thank you can't store the
weapon fuck that
oh one over here
I hope I'm not too late for the secret
survivors which I might be
so you discover these people down here
you can't rescue them until later but
you just have to randomly decide to walk
in that door during the hours when
they're around chap that Bank run is not
related to the Lenny thing I know that's
confusing

[F] you have the plates recovery so you to
find them randomly walk in that door at
the specific time they happened to be
there see this is definitely not meant
to be done your first time through and
then they ask two very odd and for two
very odd and specific items which I
already conveniently have in my
inventory
and you'll notice he looks identical to
Lenny
cool
I'm going to talk to everyone at least
once just just to make sure the game
knows I have discovered them
do I need these snide out better right
here
tonight people leaving thank you for
showing up yes how many times have I
played this game of the the the first
two dead risings especially the first
one are amongst my favorite games ever
man what does P P stand for prestige
points alright so time of the rednecks
unfortunately I happen to know just
where to go to find the rednecks
just like
it's a double check I know where the
ladder is across the way isn't it have I
forgotten no no all the ranks right oh
okay
all right these guys are a bitch to
fight so this is uh this is dangerous
no I didn't mean the Dodge a shit
oh fuck fuck
shut up Stacy
and if you don't kill these guys they'll
take potshots at you while you're
escorting survivors and they will they
will fuck your shit up
there's
where's your food stash I know you've
got a food stash now this doesn't make
me throw up that would be nasty all
right we're good we're good
I'm building it one where's the egress
I'm gonna build a new saw staff to make
sure it lasts through the next two
fights it would suck if it broke during
I'm gonna keep my Defiler fresh too
yeah it's not just the fat one all of
the snipers have little food stashes on
the roof
all right good
making it look easy that's what I do
deeds where the pedals all go oh I can't
get it I can't get it alright alright
I'll do this old school as some shit
look
fuck you oh wow
all right what should I do
should I run into the chemical okay I
got time on that yet I've a hard
I'd like to have two of the quick steps
for this next portion but is is what is
is right now
so she won't come with you unless you're
just wearing underwear
so many fights on this particular
in-game day so many fights
interesting
easy
I saw
I really want to waste it but you get a
six-shooter probably the best weapon in
the game where's where's the guy who was
hiding from you

looters

[G] 

[H] where is it
I'll bet Woods fine
you're saying that a perfect run no more
like it's over
Jeff this is the easier game overall but
it's also the one I'm nowhere near as
familiar with Dead Rising 1 I know like
the back of my hand
chant I changed out the outfit because a
quest required it I got a book like hell
to try and get no one to fold them it's
not quite over yet
the dream is alive alive
I'm doing the stakeout one right now
last time I know where he is yeah I did
I you know why I did shit in the wrong
order
I should have did see her there I should
have done her quest later I should have
done no one to fold them first but I was
just being stupid as being stupid oh my
god I'm right here I'll do it I'm right
here that was the wrong call
I didn't chat I didn't make quick steps
I just had to burn through them earlier
fuck that reeling
fucking haul just jump right off who
gives his shit
we're gonna make this and no one to fold
them is very doable still though I'm my
best run ever I think I had no one to
fold him and this next one done Alba fat
I'm not doing my best but I'm still
doing really good
chose that okay we'll get him on the way
all right Oh though so we'll listen line
up nicely this will actually line up
really nicely
bill
talk to the belt we got to do this shit
bill
stick with me come on bill this way what
we got here
could make a weapon but fuck it
sir
fine fine
technically it's not a malls as much as
it is a Vegas like casino resort so it
makes sense that you would see a lot of
porn --is-- type stuff
all right Fleming boxing gloves you've
been very good to me
keep moving
stay over there
this game sucks well maybe you suck just
saying
yes we completed folder
what about this game do I love so much
all right that that mad scramble to get
to hold him or fold him before the timer
ran out and not knowing if I was going
to do it and all of the tension that
that is what I love about it
that's what three and four are
completely fucking lacking completely
stop talking to join the fucking party
you suicidal jackass
we think they want to eat us but do we
really know that maybe they just want to
get close to it you you fucking idiot
fucking you fucking idiot you deserve to
die you just you just deserve to die
head that way
whoa
stay right there
I got two sets of boxing gloves
Oh

I'm just not bothering to I don't really
need to I'm trying to some of them
already have weapons just I got I got
shit to do man
stay close
those missions I'm missing I'm not
missing any missions what are you
talking about we're on we're on pace we
have a shot at absolute perfection
top-3 Star Trek series TNG the original
series in deep space 9 in that order
Oh what do you know I just happen to
have whiskey in my inventory Sven oh
it's kind of an amazing coincidence
you had your whacky clothing fun I'm
back to my boring old jacket thing you
can you can deal with it all right
all right
what's his jacket say oh it's uh kg and
phantoon a that the Megaman guy who made
we have so consecrated the Dead Rising
series it's his name backwards
I know we didn't create Megaman but he's
he's he's associated with the series he
didn't create Dead Rising though at
least not pretty sure he's the head guy
on it wait wait wait wait don't be
nobody willy-nilly rich where's that use
my gun I'm going to I'm saving it for
what for what is to come
nope wait yeah no listen that's what I
need
okay perfect zombie crowd navigation
perfect been streaming well yeah we're
going the whole nine yards here don't
throw a grenade with these gloves on
that that's sage-like advice my friend
and they can wait
oh this feels like such a long walk
right now
how did I get my original costume back
there's a fight
sweet okay we got a bit longer than 10
hours in-game pretty sure
Kilmer all right
oh I don't know about me like oh I
didn't know I could I get this I got my
gloves
oh wait
when a strip poker near that item that's
gonna be like one of the last things I
do I'm gonna do all this case file shit
first because it's all more important
what other location besides a mall and a
resort well they they kind of did this
and off-the-record but I always thought
of a theme park wouldn't be a bad
setting for a Dead Rising game
whoops with that one
