[Clip of Rich messing around with an arts and craft project]

Rich: Okay, so behind me today, we have 10,000 matches, and we are going to burn "The Order".

[Cut to a shot of 10,000 matches, artfully arranged alongside a copy of "The Order 1886"]

Jack: Okay, I am rolling. GoPro is rolling. Go for it, Rich!

[Rich steps into frame, and lights the matches]

Jack: I was worried it was going to go too fast. Great.

Rich: Fire dominos.

Jack: Ooh, that's hot!
