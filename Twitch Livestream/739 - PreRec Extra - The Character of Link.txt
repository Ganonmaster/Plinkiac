Rich: The character of Link. Link is, uh, uh, uh, some kind of elf man... 
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: ...with brown or yellow hair, and a green tunic...
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: ...and a floppy green hat. And he carries around the blue Hylian Shield. And he has the Master Sword.
Jack: Yeah, yeah.
Rich: That's his character. Here's a Zelda game: you don't get the green outfit! Link doesn't have a character. It's different every fucking game.
Jack: Of course.
Rich: He's, he's the most famous character in gaming -- he's an outfit! 
Jack: Mmmm...I'm, I'm, I'm, Rich said that. I did not say that. Rich said that.
