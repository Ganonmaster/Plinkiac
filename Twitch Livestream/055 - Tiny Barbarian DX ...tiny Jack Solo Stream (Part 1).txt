we wish them the best happy Canada Day
cool Canada - yay holidays one
are you uh mr. primal asked i am i
amazed by jane mikes talent the samurai
cop interview was great i I mean
constantly in awe of joy I think they I
think they did a really great job
um I you know I I've actually I've only
seen a samurai cop the movie once I was
not involved with the original find of
the samurai cop movie and so I was
really glad not to be involved in that
one I was you know behind the cameras
making sure everyone sounded and looked
okay but I think they did a great job
it's it's I want to say they talked to
him we were shooting I want to say for
two and a half maybe three hours and so
I think they did a great job cutting it
all together no it's not Canada Day what
oh it's Labor Day yeah tomorrow is Labor
Day so pour one out to all the laborers
as you already know as I've been
chatting today I'm pouring out a a
lakefront brewery extended play a really
great smooth IPA and normally there is a
is what they call it and I don't really
don't like IPAs of course I only drink
IPAs because they're a higher alcohol
content I
and John kilo I do not know when the
second part of the interview will be
released I'm pretty sure that they just
released it in two parts just so they
could get something out quicker
candy smack you're drinking steagle and
gin you lucky son of a bitch I ran out J
drank my last one and I'm okay with that
because he's my friend
so I don't know when the second one will
be released hopefully I can only imagine
this week I mean you know it's
interviews are pretty easy all right you
know what we're gonna get to the game
here we have a super fun game to play I
think if we can get it going there it is
we are gonna play tiny barbarian I have
been looking forward to playing this
since well before its release in fact I
forgot about one of the the joys of
early access is I forgot that this game
was getting released until it recently
went on a Humble Bundle sale so I am
super excited play this look good okay
press attack to begin we are gonna play
some tiny barbarian that's me
do you see me I'm a tiny bug and this is
my first time playing the game I don't
know what's going on I was really
thinking there would be music why is
there no music what's going on
what is happening here what is happening
here is this the whole game no this is
no game is it like an endless fighter
what do you guys know about tiny
barbarian apparently I know nothing oh
okay I get it it's like a scripted it's
like a scripted thing I'm with you
no Mario Cart tonight I have I have been
receiving some of your Nintendo friend
requests and I will do not next week
I'll be out of town next week so you
won't get a solo stream next week but
maybe maybe the week after I will do a
in stream Mario Kart tournament that's a
sound for everybody like some checkers
I'm not gonna be playing checkers I
apologize you know what I'm not gonna
play checkers because I'm not as good as
rich rich is too good at checkers oh my
god the serpent Lord okay here we go
guys sound is good volume thank you octo
Jay I didn't see you octo Jay our lovely
mod is here to moderate y'all hey hey oh
my god this is adorable look at this so
it's just jumping attack
also if you pressed down and the attack
button you flex your muscles shoulder
but just don't do anything so this is
straight up NES I keep it looking for
like secret stuff oh oh that's neat
though have to press anything
yeah it's pressed up okay you can press
up that looks like a secret thing right
now okay
spikes right usually if someone comes
and asks if there are spikes in this
game and the answer is of course yes
there are spikes in this game that looks
like I should be a bit doesn't matter I
keep expecting one of these walls to
break away if I slash it with my sword
that's usually a secret thing
okay here we go here we go
oh my first enemy it's a little sink
look at how adorable that is look at how
adorable and deadly
right
this is fantastic
um
get out of here you bird I don't know
like what else like I can't I can't tell
you too much about about the Matt Hanna
interview because the second part will
be coming up just bear in mind the
second half is equally as good oh yeah I
remember him talking more in depth about
about the style of guerilla filmmaking
that they were doing you know for
example he was talking about just
showing up one day and a guy lit himself
on fire and there was no fire truck
there was no ambulance and apparently
that's how that's how they made the
movies if just run and gun shooting the
director didn't have permits for
anything bird you know
wait for him to come to you that's the
name again get out of here yep fur
didn't have permits for anything but was
exceptionally good at at bullshitting
his way into any game that has a flex
but look at that was really good at
bullshitting his way into locations and
what they would do a lot on samurai cop
and I hope I'm not spoiling anything
from the next interview is the director
would figure out what big-budget movie
was shooting nearby and just say that
they were second unit and so it's like
if you know for example if Tango in cash
we're shooting down the street they like
yeah well the second unit for tango and
cash and if anyone has sold them they
didn't mmediately go oh yeah no problem
you have permits all over the place
today I jumped right into that can you
believe that I mean you can you saw on
hopefully so
so that was really fun to hear about
about stuff like that that kind of that
kind of guerilla filmmaking oh hey the
chicken it finally happened
Hidden chicken now I just want more
hidden chicken know that kind of
guerrilla stuff I'm making is super fun
especially for for someone who has done
a lot of that and in Milwaukee we don't
need to worry about that at all because
in Milwaukee you can feel not in public
without a permit but still really fun to
hear about he just had some good he has
had some good stories
definitely one get up there if I can
I do that I did it before we're gonna be

your head if you if you would like to

spines that's okay do we have an ego
guys there's an ego in this game I got
the first Chaos Emerald

oh here we go killing snakes killing
snakes a barbarian style
this music is great classic I feel like
there's a secret down here right now
just a place for me to die

chicken oh okay we got all the chicken
we could from the little guy
love that
excellent
excellent getting the snake Co get the
snakes yellow
this is so enjoyable
I don't know how we live in a world in
which these wonderfully made NES
throwbacks happened I mean know how to
have it be chock-full of nostalgia but I
think I feel like something like this or
something like shovel knight could have
turned out really poorly I mean I can't
use my NES USB controller I can't use my
bsusb
but you
oh come on come on time barbarian be
slightly less tiny that helps I don't
know if you knew that it helps what do
you say any other Jack recommend some
horror films that's not my department
that is uh that's jaye Jaye's the horror
film awesome a bit muscles
James Department is all our you're right
block Castle hunker down shovel knight
does not just stop anything nostalgia
it is its own game and experience as is
this I'm really enjoying this this is
definitely more just nostalgia whereas
shovel knight is would have been a great
game in any art style it just happens to
be a great game
in 8-bit art style did you see it did
that move the top of the screen
Oh get out of here I killed men I'll hit
you again
- oh there's gotta be something up there
I have my bail these things there we go
there we go
that's the way the way of all their
video games

dick tiny barbarian I don't care about
it that much whatever is over there
which I'm sure is nothing
whoa that asshole just threw a spear at

people yeah just cuz I can caddy a bird
and bird is that a needle buck you
symbol of freedom
oh you can hit them oh I can't fit them
and I died yay first step
and I don't know what it is guys but
I've run out of my snack much earlier
than anticipated
hold on after we got another snack pause
pause for a moment
snack run

guys take him out right toot sweet and
sword Eagle fern thought I wasn't facing
the Eagle come here you go face me like
a man yo get out of here
you're dead and this guy I can probably
elbow drop yeah
I am the Barbarian yeah yeah I remember
when I first heard about development of
this game in there there were some early
tests and some screenshots the only
reason I followed I wanna say this is
made by squall squall games I followed
them on Twitter just so I could keep up
on development of tiny barbarian and I
think I gave up rather quickly because
it was gonna be a windows-only game but
now I can play it cuz that dual boot
boom elbow drop okay
all right we're coming for you or we're
not coming for you
never mind I'm going back around yet
damn
Oh No get out of here
there yeah barbarian Oh time and gonna
lose gullu's because I got that diamond
dammit we go I feel great I feel great
about this
oh no he's doing his cheeseburger boys
oh I do that every once in a while I
don't know if you guys have seen Cloudy
with a Chance of Meatballs
but there's a moment when the computer
says cheeseburger I can only assume
that's what you mean like cheeseburger
boys okay I'm facing a cannon what what
time facing a Canada
yeah
oh my god
that's kind of dumb I'd like to be able
to hit more than once
and elbow drop cheeseburger hope he's
not dead
yeah now is checkpoint alright
someone is asking me if I drink warm
beer what warm beer
some of the saying Jack can you have
somebody's solo stream instead or to
group screams because he won't be here
next Sunday I will talk to rich about
that and see if he wants to try his very
first solo scream that's not a bad idea
because I won't be here next Sunday we
will definitely do a group stream on I
can't climb up that we'll definitely do
a group stream on Wednesday like we
normally do fact about this how do I get
up there
Mira Mira Mira him huh just subscribed
what that's Pema have you been here for
a while and you've just subscribed
welcome welcome to the pizza rolls
welcome to the cheeseburger get out of
here
which is gone rich was born for
primetime you know its rich I don't know
if you guys have noticed but rich has a
small problem talking and playing games
at the same time so the point where it's
a little silly rich rich is a little
silly about it is his lack of ability to
talk and play at the same time can might
that might hinder oh my god
my hinder the stream Jesus Christ
I mean I know you guys know that if it's
a really intense moment I'll you know
I'll go here out of me is a little um
Xander's and bandit oh I let him you you
you get cold I need some chicken out of
that guy so it's not alright that's why
I do like the group spree Maya I think
particularly last Wednesday when rich
was playing axe come and not saying a
damn thing but Jay and I were having
really good conversation so I hope you
guys liked that too you know a little
game game kind of his background right
and and some just good conversation I
felt really good about Wednesday's
stream conversation wise nice that did
you see that level design they gave me

fuck you game oh oh whoa
floating palette forms always floating
platforms that's the only way I want to
kill bats now others he's gonna keep
coming oh no totally not a joke asks SS
Jack please explain the absolute
masterpiece that you created hey hey
hehe the peepee song doesn't it speak
for itself it was just it was a silly
song that I thought was funny and I
thought I thought it would be a funny
video that's it
that's it I thought I thought it would
be really funny to have a guy look
really stupid
and when I can't pay for actors the guy
is you that's how I work sometimes I'm
sure it seems like they're busy to them
yeah
yes chicken but I spent life to get here
kind of a little that's a little fuck
you so that's it that's that's the
entirety of my story for the hand for
the peepee song is it's a dumb little
song that I was singing one day because
I do that sometimes and I thought it
would be funny and I think it is I think
it's very funny I think it's very funny
that anyone would that anyone would sing
that song so I think it holds up I think
it holds up just fine proud it is maybe
not a word I would use but you know I
like it I know that's thinking that the
people on the internet fix it on I know
that because that's one of the very few
videos that I have on my youtube channel
that get views regularly so I know I
know it's you guys I know you guys are
watching it because that's about it
if I could have hired any actor for the
peepee song any actor who would it be
you know it has to be someone but I was
going for I was I was going for like a
really bad timing this is very obvious I
was going for a really bad like
children's show host and so I would have
wanted someone like like Steve Burns who
did the Blue's Clues you know someone
who who was a a children's host a
children's program a host because that's
the joke I was going for is like it was
like a really bad
children's programming song so
in lieu of and lieu of actual
celebrities that's what I will say as I
wanted I wanted it to look like I was
trying to make a fuck I wanted it I
wanted it to look like I was a like I
was trying to make legit children song
which of course it's not it's a
ridiculous song but you know if I or
maybe you know what maybe like maybe
like a like a like a lady host
just some dumb song I made I think it's
funny and I think it's funny
Hey
I'll think different back back
back
I get that battle my sword
back back that helps but that really
helps if you say the name of the thing
that you're hitting with your sword
real good come here come on your dingus
I mean chicken don't run away yeah I got
a chicken from that's all that matters
I got I got me my chicken back

bad I donate the bat
