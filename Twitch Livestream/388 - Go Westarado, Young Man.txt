we need a second controller I do believe
we do but I do believe we have yeah yeah
alright hold on we're gonna wait for a
rich to get another controller
optimist no I have no snack tonight
mostly because I have to drive I'm
driving I'm driving home and so I
usually don't have a snack when I'm here
because I have to drive home if I were
streaming from my house I'd probably be
snacking but also not so much lately
just cuz I have a lot of stuff to do
pants and if I snack then I get too
tired to to work late at night and I
have many projects that I need to cross
off my to-do lists so I have not been
snacking that much right clean up all
the broken glass in your living room
yeah no wait what's gone what's going on
what are you doing what's happening why
are you binding things huh
what are you binding and why you're
finding keys Jack what what's going on
what's going on I'm I was binding keys
why do I don't have to if it's a
controlling do you have to I don't know

have to for sure because I didn't you
messed something up i endu anything you
while you were pressing buttons while I
was while I was trying to bind keys why
were you binding keys general mine keys

ahead of time Jack okay now I can't now
I can't get in there oh my god
wait and if I press a I go up although
what you're you don't what your
controllers not even on yeah you got a
you got a bunk USB port no oh no I blame

yes
is there a way we can rich I was right
in the middle of binding keys and you
kept hitting his game and so right now
we have nothing by bind bound to
selected as default huh

find nothing to a key you weren't you
were finding keys because it told me to
