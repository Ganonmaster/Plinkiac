everybody doing this fine day
no sound up in the game a little bit cuz
it's a rich heaven solo stream talking I
don't get that talkative originally I
was gonna try the whole Dead Rising 2 no
death run thing again as it was
originally what I wanted to do but just
ended up ended up working earlier today
and it's it's too goddamn late to start
that shit Dead Rising 2 no death run is
like a 10 or 11-hour commitment I don't
have that right now I don't I don't have
I don't have that in me I don't have
that in general so the plan instead is
gonna be I'm gonna play this here Friday
the 13th game which I have heard has
been updated with a new map a new map
and a new Jason so unless that's the
deal that's the deal yo I will I will be
revisiting Dead Rising 2
better to do Dead Rising 2 and I'm ready
I am ready it's just it's too late
it's it's too fucking late why is my
mouth not working there we go there we
go
let's check out let's check out this new
Jason
five six good / 5 okay yeah that's
pretty good for part 5 Jason I'd say
stop that go what the fuck is wrong with
you
all right fine
I'll buy it with the mouse what will
load up his unique kills here that's
that's what I want to see
okay whatever oh that's a good what's
good kill everyone likes eye gouging
head twist now head twist is fine got a
level there rich yeah I've only been
playing this on stream lately I like
this game I've stopped playing it in my
free time the bad councilors do we have
anyone new here not with this update
having mouse issues a having controller
issues in the menu whoosh not a big deal
all right
good play let's let's get into a match
let's get started I haven't played since
the last time we streamed this I'm
probably horribly horribly out of sorts
in this game it'll be a little bit even
because I'm not gonna know the new map
and neither will anyone else its price
you're not tired of the chef look I
think it's a good game
I don't you know I just it's mostly I
just play this when we stream it now
because like I said this is it usually
works really well for streaming this
game Jason X is the best Jason is that
of Jason available yet no no it's not
and I already have a first game we're
ready my planning and doing anything
else - no I'm not planning on doing
anything with this tonight it's too late
to start Dead Rising 2 I was I was
working earlier stuff was done earlier
if I were gonna do Dead Rising 2 no defi
I'd prefer to start around even new noon
maybe one earlier start is better for
that do I need to okay back it press the
talk is working right yes yes it's
working oh god those other players mics
somebody's obnoxious I'll turn them off
it's not me I am NOT Jason yeah
nice
yeah I got the map yet funky little Maps
I don't know what shit is to find a good
stuff though
this is the new rule which would map
thickness
well somebody here yeah so he was
definitely here
well they didn't get the keys
four-seaters got a battery or got him
needs a battery I should say
I'm gonna foolishly presume that that
person is that a decent job of checking
these houses and I'm moving up there
that's my check
he's a walkie
I've got keys
anybody seen the phone
where's the fucking car
kid Jason's either the best
son of a bitch kid rage quit when the
cops got called that was setup for a
good run a the battery I had the keys we
were headed to the car I had a fucking
pocket knife to spring the trap that was
almost obviously gonna be in front of
the car I got robbed
NACHA it's just it's it's too late to
start a no death run of Dead Rising 2
tonight
it just it's too late to get started
and a kid totally did fucking room on
that run
the other hand rich what if it wasn't
too late to get started then it would be
about noon or maybe one o'clock
did anyone else get away yeah now we
don't have the keys or the battery cuz
we got robbed
yeah alright dude you can have that
house I'll take this one
is anyone there this is not a break your
help
yeah well we got keys
XR bad
probably back
Oh
why I miss my pocketknife
nothing
all right
they can find a propeller we're doing
okay though it's got gas
hey I've got the propeller I've got the
propeller I'm heading to the boat
see what's not
I shouldn't do this I shouldn't give up
on the fucking boat
fix it I'm out of here
you're screwed
where's the egress I don't know where
the egress is in this map
I have no idea where I need to go is
that it orange cones pop five Jason good
and water I'm assuming not the Jason's
that are good in water tend to be the
undead ones
I'll look for the tummy son of a bitch
all right there's fuse somebody must
have picked up the keys presumably
didn't rich have the keys I dropped the
keys I put the keys down by the dock I
wasn't a jerk I did not leave with the
keys so the keys are around I'm assuming
somebody else picked them up because
they're not showing up on the map oh it
looks like somebody dropped the by the
car
so what's going on with this game this
game this right here we plan on a new
map also there's a new Jason in town
all right
so the people are running around with
the gas or the battery or nobody's found
them otherwise they'd be showing up on
the map they're usually near the car
I'm just gonna check some of these
houses near the car just going under the
assumption that Jason came to this area
earlier on chase everyone away nobody
had time to look for your shit properly
nothing in here
maybe check this house but I wanna
double check it
a new plan I think I'm gonna head into
the fuse
he's got jack shit
Oh
oh fuck
I just wanted to see what he looked like
it's really all I wanted
why is Jason 5 not Jason because part 5
Jason wasn't Jason
Last Man Standing and the only man out I
survived that shit
good evening
so part five Jason doesn't go back to
the shed so can you still kill them with
Pam's sweater panelist smile I have no
idea
yes they meant to kill Jason off in part
four which is why there is a new killer
in part five was a copycat killer
imitating Jason Voorhees but in the end
it's revealed no it's not Jason Voorhees
Jason Voorhees died in part four as well
when he gets the machete in his head
this is before Jason was officially
Undead he gets a machete to the head and
four and that's just that's just fucking
it half his head gets cut off or at
least sliced into really fucking good
you could have saved me on the boat no I
couldn't have there's someone in the
chat saying I could have saved them in
the boat not our champ in the game's
chat no I couldn't
Jason was right there if I stopped again
you let you under the boat Jason would
have come into the water and killed us
both
good luck everyone
they're going to be a Dead Rising 2 run
after this no man way too late for that
way too late for that
I'd love to do it I'm going to do it
again I'm not even I'm not sure when but
for now
Oh God we've already got people leaving
you started down a person now we already
got people leaving well this would be
quick and lopsided I'm gonna just stand
by the car and wait for Jason to show up
and kill me
stay up to 5 a.m. playing dead rising
okay Karen Karen is making dinner
tonight
she bought food she's going to cook food
she wants to make dinner I'm not gonna
go to play video games on the Internet
I have adult responsibilities to the
people in my life my life gonna save
lives that doesn't make any sense
no keys but we got a battery battery
good
I should get this battery refrigeration
shows up
yeah it's that was don't pretend I did
that right well pretend I didn't fuck up
putting that battery in that's what I'm
looking for yeah I'll take that too whew
yeah that's great
well you know that is great I'll take
that over a med Sprite
it's the four seater Western East
fixed phone it's right next door you
sure does that by the phone goes I
didn't see the phone I'm sure about this
that phone was not right next door to me
there did I get for listening to my chat
it's Jack here that Jack is not here
Jack and I make it we're stuck with me
and only me to guide you to guide you
through this awful life we've got to get
to the four cedar which is gone wait
where is it
it's just gonna let the four-seater get
away you fucking Jason
save the girl that's my distraction hey
Jojo let's kill them
get a machete
oh she's got that swim
I feel to kill need a baseball let's get
a machete for you jo-jo some machete in
here by me
nice
I know you can I chase it I didn't know
better I'd say you were running from us
I'm stream Jason kill I guess I had very
little to do with this
camera angle for it sucked
you know teaching left at the beginning
of the game I didn't think we had a
chance yeah I'm not the first time I
used that I'm not really good at Jason
doesn't happen every day
what happened
Jason was killed
anybody clip and it wasn't super excited
and I had I had almost nothing to do
with it I found I found the machete that
Sami Jarvis had to use I found the
machete next I didn't do much I was
there at the tail end
I gave them the competence yeah
go ahead a dark in here
that is better than nothing
fuck
all right I'm gonna take a machete
Justin here yep this house blows
it's like a radio
all right
not by anything super interesting
Romer the Freddy vs. Jason map take
place well you'd you'd have to do it in
Elm Street really though that might be
too urban there might be just too many
fucking buildings for that to work as a
map for this game
but if you're not if you're not gonna
make it Elm Street why bother doing a
Freddy vs. Jason map
go to car
boathook we're gonna check out this
house here because it's right here
if I see a propeller in this house we're
definitely going for the boat otherwise
I'm gonna bring this over to the car
my gas back
it's on the way we're gonna stop at this
house we're gonna check out and I think
someone's been here probably not find it
here
do we want to swim across this I don't
want to it's it's by far the quickest
way there shit we're doing it
that's real Jason music
I'm not shocking I took a risk oh that's
a nice death
oh well no wonder next to nobody was
playing
do I wait around her I'm just gonna fuck
out in my ass get the fuck out here
switch to steam rich what what the heck
are you talking about
curse me what's stopping Jason's from
just camping at the escape vehicles
waiting for survivors well there's three
routes to escape - please that's kind of
what Jason does do but he can't be
everywhere at once
I love Tide Pods - they're fucking or
just find a new room using a mic they
might communicate good in game really
like it when you stream this game it's
always fun it usually is I'll have it up
wherever is so so night tonight with
Friday the 13th
you close your window deal I don't I
know this dog it's pressed hard
once again I am NOT Jason
yeah you know it plays the new Jason
with Vaughn's I mean that's that's less
fun
they're once again not the best
beginning
we phone cast in this barn last time
right where did it spawn nothing to
necessarily be there again
what a car adventure car adventure would
be nice
you would you would
little suckers home
I'm kind of suck some power in your
phone
Hey what what is that
alright I want play walk away yeah look
it's disgusting she's spreading away
it's really really nasty oh well I'm
sorry Chad but you deserve that good
she was kind of suicidal yes Chad stated
she she was suicidal so she deserved to
go that way
yes those people were literally worse
than AIDS I can't help but I can't help
what play with Matt it's up to the the
surfer gods or the matchmaking God's
however the fuck that works I don't know
I don't know I don't know no thing
what are your pluses and minuses
throwing in stock and run okay oh I
think I hate this Jason we're gonna play
as him because he's new but looking at
his stats I absolutely hate this Jason
hey you don't I'm doing all right it's
it's not that I hate Friday the 13th
part five that's that I looking at this
Jason's pros and cons he's a terrible
Jason to play as
the running is fine but there are other
Jason's that have running that are
better throwing knives I I don't give a
fuck about clustering knives - strength
means less cool kills - stun means
councillors are gonna be stunning harass
a lot - defense means your mask is gonna
be knocked off easily this is if you're
going for a kill this is gonna be an
excessively easy Jason to kill so if
you're going for a Jason kill it looks
like you want to be playing against part
5
of course
that is not good you know well that's
better than you know dying
what your name rain Dodger wait some
wait what did he say it was all is that
you oh wait does he have shift cuz I
heard the music cut in and cut out to my
right right yeah probably not
I have a map though it's like a way
across the map fuse house alright I'll
fix it up yeah I have a med spray he put
two on it oh come on with a piece of
trash alright yeah this one back here I
got lucky
yes so do i I have a pocket knife too so
should I just because neither of them
alert him so I'll just use this one too
so now we can repair the phone piece cuz
now he doesn't know a thing
what just happened well Jason was by the
car and I was heading towards the car
but he didn't see me and he left to go
elsewhere right as I was coming around
the corner oh there is I love this music
though like and now I have to stand next
to him
I love your music but I have to shoot
you or else I'm not really a good
counselor
hey hi you're so fast
hey how every Jake's there so fast now
oh boy what yeah I'm dead I'm dead
I passed my out of here
Oh 2-seater that's kind of promising
well fuck me
I don't know where Hey I can't fault the
Jason he used Stockwell
wasn't the Six Senses scary I don't
think it's trying to be super
frightening it's only a horror movie I
think it's creepy
wait around here just find in a room it
is probably the fastest Jason which I
guess there's something to be said for
that reason he might be faster than the
other Jason's who can run which is worth
something that might make up for some of
the other drawbacks
but never helped anybody man yeah I know
they all came in fourth to fucking time
this match is literally warfare because
Opie the Jason's are now he should have
he oughta fish in the pad
I blame the cops for taking their yeah
there's just a mass murderer there
there's no need we don't need to go fast
- I'll get there five minutes stop at
Dunkin Donuts first you gotta get that
coffee I really do like his animation
know how it doesn't walk into the Shack
but he just walks off we stick around
where do we find a different room then
he goes to the shack he walks a lot you
have to kit the kids the kid doesn't
communicate horribly he's saying useful
things in addition to the normal chatter
he's doing switch leaves which I think I
think we switched automatically
sico I appreciate sapphires oh no now
two people are completely random love it
my boy but yes to that that means I'm
gonna be first to die
of course five
find them Jason make them pay for what
they did to us
keep you from me Jason don't let them
you can never die that's my special
special falling better never mind it uh
targets on me Jason's on me Jesus on me
but I know where beta is fortunately
it's not letting me pick up this weapon
that is beta I need help I'm gonna do it
cuz I have the thing for that
but moving to beta is eating your beta
cuz I use music you taught me I think
powerbox gonna fix it now
various he's on me again he's on me he's
on me fix pay to fix beta know we're
talking a code there's that phone
probably phone
possibly Shaq he's on me yeah get the
boat ready yeah he just marked so you
got time I'm out the phone yeah
yeah go get the boat ready you can't
even more frightening on oh they're
getting the boat that's peaceful a shit
for one for everything he's he's on he's
a big boy
okay so yeah I'm sacrificing myself so
you guys better get that BOGO
I have Jason on me
okay I'm dead by its in the box it's in
the box okay but did you get rid of the
trap
don't stop Jason they deserve to die
make them suffer like we did it's not in
the box what are you talking about
he's over by the phone box get up Jason
find them kill them
Jason do you know what your gift is no
matter what they do to you you cannot
die
you can never die
that's my boy
hunt them down and make them pay all
right where's the other one HAP's
they're hiding in here aren't they
maybe I'm wrong
there's a house up by the bridge I just
never mind they want to hurt you Jason
don't stop Jason they deserve to die
make them suffer like
Oh oh no it's too close you get a hand
run out the back door quick
yeah
there is yet nerd run this run sorry if
I was blocky
can we talk about this Jason no I'm
asking if he wants to talk I don't think
he wants to talk you're not tricking me
with that stuff if you're trying to do
that
you almost tricked me but I'm a stay put
in this house my house
go away Jason I'll be through knife at
me as well I have a spring yes he
stuffed in my trap no matter what they
do to you you cannot i'm going i'm dead
it's chilly everything killed like this
before
don't stop Jason they deserve to die
make them suffer like we did nice no one
gets out alive yeah I look a little
weird at the end there but I'm more
afraid of relying hard to get out of
these I saw where he was headed
yeah I can't talk I in fact have a mouth
you know I'm playing the game I'm
concentrating on the game man no time
for idle chitchat or when I'm
slaughtering
I feel bad for your victims guys you
realize he's streaming this right
probably about 700 people or so I think
yeah
does that mean we're even are we even
hell yeah hey it's Roy
should I just leave this on random cuz
this new map is pretty hard 666 read 666
that's that's pretty sweet I can't live
without you now you've gotta sing before
your eyes to all I ask of you
I am so sorry is that from from not
Jason just get off of the car alone that
sounds like a fine idea
I still get
hey I killed them all that was enough
you still get to what I first I want to
see the play enough theater as opposed
to like a video of it the original or
the I've seen phantom twice
can't get in there that's fair
fair enough
that's just outside
phone
that's probably really dangerous to be
here
as big as this house is there's like
nothing to search for shit
that's just a big empty fucking house
give me a fuse
give me a fuse one of you one of you
doors give me a fuse
I bet at wasted time this house
all right that's a lot of nothing a
whole lot of nothing I want to see I
want to see phantom I wants to get on
stage though I saw it here like a few
years ago well I guess I got a drop
$3,000 yeah
yeah take that
this radio or not there is a door right
here
that was perfect
there's not even a few I mean there's
not even no trap
do you have the fuse I've got the my
dad's a cop perk now they don't talk oh
it's you you got the perk do it but do
you have the perk part I've got I've got
the epic Kirk I'm heading to the house
right now okay what else is doing it
nevermind we actually called the cops
does that still count as me having
played this counselor who are you
playing as Kenny go Kenny Kenny
Chason got tired of hearing about the
phantom yep probably
yes Chad I know about the virtual cabin
I didn't play through my she saw the end
on YouTube Oh IIIi did spoil the head I
was thing about having Jack play through
the virtual cabin
rich you are the coolest nerd yeah a
nominee because I'd beat people at a
video game that's why I hate multiplayer
gaming in general it's one of the yeah
no yeah that's a solid strike against it
klepto Bismil says rich so as rich had
the ability to play his part 5 yet and
if so how does he feel about his kills
well you showed up at just the wrong
time you you you must have just missed
it and oh they're great kills rich what
is your favorite religion pastafarian
there any game coming out that I am
hyped for I'm not really but I'm not
sure of what all's coming out on the top
of my head there might be something that
I'm not thinking of or forgetting or
maybe even something I don't know about
oh shit I finally managed to catch one
of these live and fortunately you picked
a ridge solo stream to catch live kept
up I'm usually not that good with with
vocalizing while I'm concentrating on a
game and it's nice when there's someone
in the room with me I get talking like
jack for instance but dad is where does
it been the best
I did discover that I'm a nerd
apparently I'm a nerd we do new who knew
Shetty you know I wasn't I wasn't all
that involved with it but we did have a
Jason kill tonight and I think no matter
what it hasn't been a horrible night
they did have to get pretty bad from
here on out for this to have been a
horrible night look at that sweet
should have gotten the gas first I I
can't help which one I find first man I
can't set things down to hide them
anymore since items started appearing on
the mini-map once they've been dropped
so we just kind of got to get lucky find
gas I'm happy to be nice to
that's the house we came from yeah
I don't care about doors or anything we
need fucking gas find out I really don't
need like a pocket knife or something
man door no gasps no gasps
all right next next house
to get out of my boat everything
and I don't know what anything is on
this map not the best situation what's
with the music they try to fake you out
every now and then which I don't mind
once you know the music in this game you
can tell the difference usually pretty
easily
some barn gasps so that barn gasps come
on
both the paired ass son of a bitch like
us my bride
no work has been done on the car no work
has been done on the phone oh fuck
I should have just waited by the boat
until somebody showed up
somebody's been in here
they do something to make the flashlight
effects obnoxious they have an escaped
on the boat yet
I really need a fucking map
Oh
Fox
probably in stock by the bill
pretty fucked anyway
I'm pretty funny
it's your only fucking chance
this is an effort killed nine of eight
fuck does that happen
Tommy Tommy counts as it's normally 7
Tommy counts as 8 tonight of 8 is weird
it
we check cock
all right no tips from today
litter
maybe we're gonna skip this time
why playing Deborah I
I like Deborah as a character I like it
not as her I like her repair stab
relatively good Estelle
rich why are you playing this shit to
annoy you specifically
doesn't have the ground up missing my
father packing a cold a sonic I think
knows by the the way out
game give me give me something to work
with
yes just jakka's jack is not here
tonight tonight is rich rich solo I'm
stinking the joint up take that
anybody seen the phone
now we've got the Megan's we've got the
Megan's
nobody's seen the phone
all right these players all suck
and uh sometimes the phone spawns here
let's get
where the kids on Crystal Lake
but they're so far away
but
she might start carrying the poke that
lets me carry the map I mean I know
where I am here but it'd be nice to see
shit on the mini-map
like if somebody dropped the battery
somewhere or something I would love to
know right now there we go
I see no battery on the map
though honestly I think cops the way to
go we're getting out with the cops
I could use a better weapon yeah check
this hospital
fly-in a pocketknife we'd be fucking
seven
Logan I'll take a version
probably not gonna find a pocket knife
versus people would wait up
Frank shot
everyone's can escape
yeah at least you didn't rage quit
that's a lot of XP though
