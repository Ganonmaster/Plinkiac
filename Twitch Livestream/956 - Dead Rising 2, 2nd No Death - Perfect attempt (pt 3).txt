ah
all the toys are gone yes cuz I
completed the quest
I gave Katy all the things so she's just
kind of good after that
puts him all the way cuz she's done
playing with them the second she gets
all of her toys I don't know
fuck
that's my word
quickest route and where I'm at that's
clear or straight over there through the
shortcut there industry
quick-step lasts decently a long time
[Music]
how many millions of times as rich
played dead rising this is dead rising
too motherfucker ain't gonna like it
fuck out here man well harsh my vibe
it's dead rising 2 better than the first
but people think so uh I don't I prefer
one but they're both great games
[Music]
why is everyone insane because in a
zombie game that's the best way to have
boss fights it was better than like
fighting the super zombie
Wow there you'll fucker
it feels like a Penn & Teller bit still
at it and still perfect to
that's cute but it's slowing me down
all right all right Chad read the text
here all right read the text or I'll
read it all right he must not have heard
your set maybe he can settle this
they're both comedians hey pal you got
to help me out grandpa over that up
grandpa
over there and I have her both in town
for the comedian of the Year award I was
killing the crowd with my jokes then
these zombies come around and started
killing them for real I can't stand to
be upstaged those zombies are still out
there but if you follow me I can get you
to safety
nothing doing pal we're gonna find who
the comedian of the year was and we
leave until we do just listen to my joke
and Walter sad attempt and give the
trophy on the counter to the funny one
so that's the trophy I gotta give one of
them a trophy if you're a tasteful man
like myself then you are sick of tired
old comedians trying to be funny and
just ending up pathetic
let me lay down some fresh lines from
the new hotness of comedy what do sloppy
zombies get on their clothes when they
eat stains
oh snap stains I kill me how that one
gets me every time stains so good I'll
almost make them myself what do you
think okay get ready to laugh what does
a vegan zombie eat grains ah ha ha ha
grains get it grains that's pure comedic
genius that is took me hours to think
that up worthy of a trophy what do you
say ok ok Chad Chad this is interactive
interactive gaming here twitchit twitchy
active twitch connectivity which one of
them do I give the trophy stains or
grains I've seen 3-4 stains one for
grains oh I think grains is Winnick
grains is pulled ahead
we now have grains were giving it to
grains now this guy won't come unless I
give him money cuz he's mad I didn't
pick him if I give it to this guy and
the other guy he still joins me but he
cries
really he deserves to die but my goal is
to save everybody so that's what it is
yes what a zombies ROI
move that way
okay it's a cute weapon good for it
come on you go there
fresh six-shooter
stick to me
which joke did I think was funnier half
probably grains yes I'm still going
this lady might jump she said be she got
separated from her mother she thinks her
mother's dead so I have to go find her
mother
all right Atlantica cocido when they're
an exploded helicopter up here I mean
this roof this roof should be a fucking
mess which is funny because the male car
from the mailman guy that's still there
I don't know what's the mail car cuz the
mailman was driving it the mailman the
go-cart car cart whatever you want to
call it is still where we had the boss
fight where it blew up the helicopter is
not where the helicopter blew up at
there they're not being consistent
keep one eye on my health wrenches every
question with the fucking for asking
tongue oh you're reading that into it no
no
well you guys just take care of yourself
I think these are the mother nod no
they're not quite the last survivors but
the last survivors for a while
fuck it's a fucking marathon man you
take a gun
I wonder take
this way
yeah
she's right here yes mister Dead Rising
1 I'd be taking a picture of that
faster
see how mama handle some machine gun
lady yes
move it go over there
what are you doing up there whether it's
a release there
all right we get this locked up we can
we can play poker until the military
arrives nice relaxing poker
Oh
good
okay
oh I just happened to have the plant you
need in my inventory yes what are the
odds all right now we need to go get
gambling books again
and this will determine whether or not I
get the perfect run probably not going
to happen
[Applause]
Katie and summer Katie the Katie thing
that's on lockdown man I got I got more
Zombrex than a need we're fine we're
fine
wait don't forget the other book let's
figure out the other book
lots of zombies
Chad's depending upon how you ask I
count as Gen X or Gen Y
I don't even know if gen-y is still
considered sitter to thing yeah no harm
to have the baseball bat
what's the few of the zombies you can
kill and still beat the game I don't
know I haven't done much pointless
zombie slaughter and you can see I'm
just running through them thud so
there's probably someone out there who's
try to know zombies killed run I don't
know
there
do I still hate the Cubs no I just
magically started liking them there's
like me ajik
all race
really all right so slow raise yes

problem is

of my head

call and I just got a pair now though
don't have a queen I forgot one even had
it's fine it's fine
shit
I just need one of you to be knocked out
and they get it they got to be knocked
out multiple times because they lose an
article of clothing so it's a brave

sense I got nothing I know that's a
terrible poker face but they can't see

playing though if I can beat Woodrow why
not

I will read them now
that I see the venom trailer now and I
probably won't like does anybody care
about the venom movie do they I don't
try again it looks like my tips aren't
even loading though
all right let's try one last time to
load up tips kind of a lot yonder yonder
says just cuz I love you guys probably
love to Ali oh thank you yonder yonder
sir dank at the well hi rich
thanks for the impromptu stream to get
me through the last few hours of work
what was creepier to deal with Jack as a
clown or Jack as a priest he seems to
fill both roles a bit too well Jack is a
clone I don't know what you're talking
about
hey dtq ka says just right across the
stream I'm excited good luck rich thank
you Cyrus the mild cold says hi rich we
don't have baseball where I live but so
called soccer football is popular would
you find it objectionable if I sent you
a cap with my hometown soccer team logo
for your collection that's fine you can
do that man
el bozo Grande says I heard you like FTL
why not try adventures in the galaxy of
fence have ulis wonder Taemin oh you
know what why don't I turn off my Dead
Rising 2 game right now and started up
I'm kidding I'm not even heard of it
honestly also heard you like text-based
games why not try trilby notes both
Yahtzee crochet and they're free okay
both by Yahtzee crochet okay I'll look
into it a jack may have already played
it I know he's played at least one of
them I think it's white at least one of
a yacht C's games bass clown Stein says
did you ever notice that the carpet the
casino area has the same carpet as the
shining a slight color variant but the
same pattern interesting
interesting Jack Lemmon says hey rich
thanks for the birthday stream you're
welcome happy birthday Jack come on Ordo
Minnie says rich scoots yourself all
right scoot yourself to the right a
little on the screen goddamn it I'm dead
I'm just a head now Anonymous's have you
guys considered ending half in the bag
for a new show maybe Mike and JB ready a
show hosted the city or something she
seems like they don't really like doing
it's fine they like it just fine what
wait what wait I'll tell you what we
don't like storylines that go on too
long I think I think that's coming to an
end but we might do just you know
standalone episodes but III me me just
speaking for me i-i've never been fond
of the multi-multi show arc always seems
like it gets dragged out too much
none of us says hi thanks for the solo
stream you're welcome
sannen since 1992 sis thanks for all the
entertainment over the years rich to you
Jack and the rest of the red letter
media crew thank you hi Karen sorry
running late I'm doing I told Karen I
was gonna be a while I'm gonna play Dead
Rising 2 today I was gonna play it until
I died and I'm sorry Karen but I I'm
just doing too good and I haven't died
yet I might be another couple hours I
love you I'm sorry
and then the blue prism says next you
should do a thief Gold run I don't I
don't think I don't well not well now we
got a lot more practice I don't think
I'd be able to pull off a no death Efram
okay let's let's finish game up and
stuff
all right um what what do I need to do
what should I do
stuff I should do stuff don't need you
don't need you we're completely done
with the gambling books gambling books
get put away and then we're gonna go get
useful things like health items
now
Oh clearly your hitting you with the
boxing glove
to be fair to the person who didn't know
about that shortcut you actually have to
unlock that one by saving the the girl I
saved in the tanning bed right around
the same time I did the slappy mission
chainsaw
right now we're planning ahead
yeah you bitch the mothers a bitch
a little bit of time to goofer on
they had that in Dead Rising 1 2 and the
case files were over and I was just
dicking around with the military
thank you the real thing on you have a
nice night too
all right
gonna have the couple crowd for this I
never actually got the freedom bear card
I'm gonna rectify that right now I got
time I got time I can go get the freedom
bear card
I have to work in the morning and I
don't have anything pressing in the
morning I mean this shit I'll probably
end up doing but there's there's no rush
we didn't feel bad I used the freedom
bearer without having the card first
hello
what am I trying to do today I'm trying
to have a perfect run of this game and
we're getting there
we're getting there
yes there is a secret combo card but I'm
probably not gonna have enough time to
dig around with that right now
well what's the dead rising when music I
think the volume is a little bit low on
my end here and I want to pick it up on
the mic
goddamnit time for this
Tate murdered I can wait
boom I got time I got time relax I know
the blinking scary but I got time
now I don't I don't think we're gonna
end up going 12 hours
aren't you supposed to be watching TK
didn't want to miss the rescue don't
worry he's not cold
military has come to rescue everyone
games over we did it we did it everybody
we did it
we sky such a fucking stereotype
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Laughter]
I know how did the driver die it's fine
it's fine
[Laughter]
what the hell just happened zombies
can't take out a military column they
can't
cabinet regular zombies can what
happened what is she thinking
I've gotta go that was the military
rescue we're gonna have to go out there
and find a way out ourselves know
everybody wait a minute there's another
part the standard operating procedure my
understanding is if there's a problem
with the rescue operation there'll be
another attempt in 24 hours if it looks
like there's any survivors what do you
mean you're understanding how far in am
I um 20% 20% in Oh gonna be a long night
firebombing it's the only way to get rid
of them
I have to go get Rebecca Chuck be
careful those things can take the
military
okay
there's this flaming arms and make
ourselves a Defiler a Mayans weapon
first things first tape it or die pull
their asses out of the fire
perfect
does he talk frequently but usually when
I got Jack her if you're if you're just
walking in and have no idea who I am I
normally stream with my friend Jack and
we talked to each other while we play
games usually when I'm alone I'm a lot
more quiet especially when I'm
concentrating because I'm going for
something here for a full complete play
through this game where I don't die in
100% and that we're getting close
we're getting close
I'm a big dumb
makes me think you are I'll take one
okay
I'm really happy
these are the guys we saw earlier
sorry Johnny pipes
oops
oh you kids in your wacky names
don't stop moving guys come on
still there keep going move it
follow me keep it moving come on
like why are the zombies all hard now
because of their zombie gasp can't you
see the zombie gas
it's the reason everything's green now
oh you read that donkey lamp he's using
it as a weapon
keep close
stick with me
stick to me
all right
boh-chan at this point I know everybody
who needs to come with we're good we're
good
don't worry we're good
oh sure I was gonna hit this trees
yeah
let's rise
magazine was had a leadership I'm
grabbing it for a reason I asked
spoilers there's gonna be a couple more
survivors and two of them are gonna have
a limp which means you have to help
carry them and if I got the leadership
book survivors who have some kind of
injury or limp that can't move fast they
move normally so if I have the
leadership book I can grab everybody in
one go
[Music]
[Music]
you know what
shoot
although machetes not working so I can't
see chat properly I'm trying to fix that
right now
you're not gonna work are you oh well oh
well connect
yeah there we go
all right
which batted engaging his viewers Evans
you know you don't have to be here man
look I'm having a really good run and
come on man let me have this
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
are you okay my legs we better get back
to the bunker
anyone there then I got leadership work
let's go you should be able to walk yeah
you can walk all right good
and I she can't bring this gun with him
for reasons Longway
totally going the wrong way
rich reading tips and I really can't
I stopped to read a bunch of once
earlier I might I might read the rest at
the end of the stream probably won't be
that many so probably will
they'll shoot you if you if you have a
gun in your inventory
alright see normally this other guy here
he's he's limping or know him he's
limping but it'll be it'll be fine
because I got the leadership book stop
shooting me yes we still have the
perfect run going so far yeah
I just got a speed upgrade I'm chugging
how's it going I might tire you a little
bit nature the beast I guess
[Music]
what happened to the zombies out there
they went berserk Chad I don't consider
caffeine a drug Dead Rising 3 perfect
run any time soon no incidentally at
this point in order to have a perfect
run all I have to do is stay alive and
finish the story
survivors are all done death is
certainly possible yeah there's some
there's some difficult stuff coming up
and the very end of the game I don't
know how to cheese it like I did with
Dead Rising 1 I just have two outs kill
the game so I'm not home free not by a
long shot
yeah one of the first sniper I ran
across almost killed me
I was down to one glowing health block I
didn't play it safe though I went on the
attack and won so yeah cool it was fun
no no death my spit
the door it's been briefed uh-oh
those zombies and the safely
[Music]
all right get the things gotta get the
things and fix the door I presume these
survivors can die in this section which
would suck god I must have gotten one
last speed upgrade I am moving so
fucking fast right now
[Music]
where is it
but first drew me to Dead Rising
previews of the game the first game just
sounded really need
[Music]
safehouse is secured look at all the
zombies secured my ass game take place
all in one day
for days they think
TK got bit
I knew I was sitting by the door you
gotta give me Zombrex Chucky and you
gotta move we oughta toss him out there
with his own kind let him tear each
other to pieces he hasn't turned yet why
some people are just more resistant to
the infection than others I can set you
free man
you gotta help me how long does he have
I don't think until he turns Chuck
the time it takes you to turn into a
zombie is is variableness Dead Rising 1
was well over a day for Frank
he'll get everyone this is the story of
the century
well no one's gonna hear it unless we
get the hell out of here there's more
going on here than just a heist first
the gas and now this no T keyframe
shocked and started the outbreak but
there's no way he could access the media
with that lie that we're all dead and he
couldn't order a military fire bombing
is bigger but don't go making it worse
and start making things up Rebecca look
at the video during the rescue why
didn't she call the helicopters in the
first place that's a damn fine question
yes
whoa buddy those tunnels are gonna be
crawling with thousands of those gas
zombies whatever they going down there
is just plain suicide we don't have a
choice now we all got choices boy Oh
with you now you take it easy for a
while you've got your story
yes this game is about family
not to be fair chucks been pretty lucky
so far so they should be worried about
him going back on I mean you know come
on come on man
oh yeah I don't want to forget that good
point
you end up with the redhead or the Asian
at the end that's a fantastic question
if if you don't know only if you don't
know you know what take bets take bets
on it
let me fun
with the face
how the twins fight go pretty smoothly
those trouble I had with a boss was the
first sniper so then Brandon Brandon
fights a real bitch but the sniper very
nearly did me in
I did save the tiger the tiger
disappears after you would give Katy all
of her gifts because I guess the tiger
is considered one of Katie's gifts
yeah
yeah I want something ranged yeah I'll
go get that gun
should you go to bed no maybe another
hour I'm gonna say our let's write down
there anyway
interesting
[Music]
stop oh yeah
coffee creamer cure for everything
there we go that's what I need all right
where's the nearest fucking maintenance
door
yep right here we're good we're good
[Music]
fucking impressively game zombies Oh
my growling stomach audible I had lunch
at noon haven't had dinner
oh fuck that's a ways away
that's better
where are they going that's where are
they going not trying to solve it just
try to sell soon
what is the mystery of the zombies
that's where we're at in the game what's
the big what's the big deal what's the
mystery what's going on what's the plot
they're ignoring you because they're
drawn to this thing
yes they're harvesting bees this whole
thing is a catch-22 the zombies are
harvesting zombie bees so they could
make Zombrex to give it to people who
might turn into zombies but they need
more zombies to get more zombie bees to
make more Zombrex yes they're using the
gas to get the bees to mature faster yes
okay
not much better
while this gun
you'll never make that gun better as
mouse controls
these greens are fully mature things are
going just as predicted what's wrong
with using existing zombies to make ma
the antidote
they're the ones who caused this
outbreak they use TK or they paid TK to
release the zombies DK just used the
opportunity to rob the banks
while rich misses three missed three
times
yeah it's controller aiming though I
hate it
if I could use the mouse it with the
controller in my hand that would be fine
but as it is full on switching like the
mouse with the keyboard and the switch
get in the menus it would be a it would
be a hassle PC port of Dead Rising 1 you
don't have to like toggle whether or not
you're using mouse or controller it's
there all you can use them both at the
same time so I'll frequently just have
the mouse sitting next to us to be
moving with the controller but I just
reached down to grab the mouse to aim
and dead rising one
it's totally doable the keyboard um I'm
not doubting it's doable of a keyboard
right now it's a matter of what I'm used
to I'm used to playing the Dead Rising
games with a gamepad it's just what I'm
used to
yeah yeah
- my god - here he's fucking quiet
badass
this game has a lot of plot holes yeah
I'm not gonna doubt that like I'm not
gonna argue against that actually right
before we go
that anymore oh I don't eat that anymore
we're ready to go
let's do this
which might have a problem okay
painkillers rich is not taking chances
because he has a perfect deathless run
going and why takes stupid chances get
on the waterslide I did it earlier am I
tired o night all by Nature so I'm not
tired not not like sleepy tired but this
is a lot to go through at once
yeah I don't I don't know that I'm gonna
make it to level 50 I don't I don't
think that's gonna be a thing I have
before I know it's possible but I'm not
gonna do it now
what is her uptime how many times have
beaten this game less than Dead Rising
one but five
it's behind everything okay so we end up
with all the way I found this down there
to help
the redhead the answer is the redhead
Stacy
[Music]
goodbye Rebecca Chang ace reporter
Rebecca Chang
corpse isn't even in the room look at
that are there scared oh you're scared
they've been through so much you've got
to save them Chuck
what is it
oh this is nice actually not the first
time I've beat Dead Rising 2 no death
but certainly the first time I've done
it stream and first time I've had like a
perfect game at least with all the side
missions - I've saved everybody and beat
it with no dad but not while doing all
so all of a little survivor request
yep
yeah and in one sitting yeah
I don't I have not done this without
pausing and I don't mean like the pause
menu
somebody posted a plug I know that's
coming
no I have made level 50 starting level 1
it's doable I don't think I'm gonna do
it this time but it is doable
well they call the yeah that'll do
nicely
that'll do nicely
dear to ambient music versus dear one
ambi music uh it's not bad in DRC girls
take dr1
hey they say this is not the time
so you're behind this
this awesome games done quick you do
know I've been streaming for 11 hours
right
[Laughter]
[Music]
take a look a Dead Rising to the last
day you can't end a little bit early
nope nope jackass
I don't want to fall in that hole
[Music]
whoa what the fuck was that
Wow
Sullivan's more dangerous than I thought
nope
oh he got hit with a pump I didn't even
I didn't even get this luck killing blow
in he got hit with a bomb that was scary
that was motherfucking scary
[Laughter]
I'll take it
channel 6 Action News this is Chuck
green you want the scoop of a lifetime
there's a bunker full of survivors in
Fortune City and I've got the proof of
what happened here I need rescue
choppers
by the way you'll notice you know Chuck
green usually has a pun when he killed
somebody they did that pun ahead of time
when he leaves the security room to go
track down Sullivan he says don't worry
he's not getting out of here in one
piece
hey they pre pundit it was a pre pun
when ladies and gentlemen we've done it
no no no chat we ain't done jack shit we
ain't done jack shit yet
to
yeah we're about 30% done
Oh
I need some Star Wars Jesus strange
thing is they taste just like Jesus
can I stood up I'm fine
I'm fine
[Music]
yes they're a still gameplay
[Music]
said I'm not acting excited because I'm
not done yet there's more game filled
the sound
[Music]
[Music]
how's that
why are you really worried about baby
all right let me know if you're hearing
this
okay you hear that's good good
[Music]
[Music]
all right overtime mode here we go it's
gonna serve me well
shit lot of quick steps I'll be fine
actually you know what I used a lot
maybe I should make a few more all right
that's not unreasonable
we don't we don't just go straight to
the boss fight anyway so
boxing gloves a little bit less useful
to me now is there anyone left to save
your daughter and love interest the two
most important people other than that no
like
go to the pool bar now we're good
where's it's in here I just have to go
in a little mini fetch quest then we'll
be done worse something in the pharmacy
over here I go out there not really
anything over here is that
wait that's not I wanted to go dumb
why shucks to like that no it's not but
I still have to pay for the things
that's weird
oh no there's there's a dude there
dinah meat not gonna goof around we're
gonna this quick
we've been streaming long enough more
than long enough
so I have no idea why he wants some of
this stuff what's it's TK having me get
a gift basket for that there's no payoff
for that no payoff for that
lab coat why why yeah that works
does anybody been here since the start
of the stream you have well Magus I'm
impressed
where is it Rizza I know it's here
somewhere
where is it
where's the entrance I'm looking for
that's
[Laughter]
what is the current mission I am going
on TK's fetch quest so that I can
confront TK but you got to go in the
fetch quest first no good reason why you
just do man
that rising ones overtime mode was also
a fetch quest but at least things you
got there was a reason for them
she needed these things to make the cure
I need a Bunsen burner and I need a
magnifying glass I think she would need
the mid sense this we're just we're just
collecting random crap it's fine oh wait
we glitched or something that'd be stuck
down here
why would you need a Bunsen burner with
a magnifying just general tools for
science lady to work on stuff magnifying
glass to see things I had whatever small
things it made some amount of sense did
so she needs a lab coat well she didn't
need the lab coat you didn't need a lab
coat in Dead Rising 1 this is entirely
different game
okay
it's telling me this wedding I'm not
sure how to get down there for there for
sure
let's do this
all right
best way
Oh for fuck's sake that made me lose my
ride
whoo
yeah one way or the other Chet we're not
getting to 12 hours this will end in the
eleventh hour
oh where you gonna go
huh weird
the lights work now
I have a horn
yes
yes
yes it's a hamster ball for people and
all said and done don't get out there we
go
yeah I could grind zombies to try and
get the level 50 but I think we all want
to go home
how's it going well it's going well
we're almost there
no way to choose this
was this guy this is the guy that framed
you for releasing the zombies for
starting this is also the guy that tried
to rob the casinos once all the cops
were zombified and since we foiled all
of his plans now he just wants revenge
he didn't give him the Zombrex would you
not get this ending no no you'd get a
lamer ending which actually is arguably
the canonical ending
fucker can't use well you you lose
everything from your inventory the shit
I could pick up around here but
props
but I can't avoid that shit my way TK I
need to save Katie
where the fuck did you get that
whoa
man you fucked
that was the day I was pretty nice fight
I guess I I liked dead rising one more
but this might actually be my favorite
boss fight in the series maybe boss
character is Adam easily but that's a
good battle Oh perfect
I mean I am now the Dead Rising master I
have mastery of the only two Dead Rising
games that matter oh there was some
thrilling moments in there there really
were
I remember no one to hold him almost
miss that one no I got there in time the
perfect run oh shit not as exciting as
spinning the boss to death but very
satisfying very fucking satisfying
yes so watch your heroes walk off into
the sunset poker was the best part of
the night
that's interesting
I'm not I'm not gonna argue with you
about that but I find it interesting
that with one of the most entertaining
parts to watch what yeah I know there's
a screamer
[Music]
fuck
fuck stream on Wednesday uh let me talk
to Jack and find out what's going on for
Wednesday I didn't know it was
Valentine's so let me I'm gonna fine I'm

the relative red letter media thank you
the blue prism says next you should do
it
Heath gold run I don't I would need a
lot more practice before I could do
thief death necklace and for another
thing I don't I don't know that a
marathon a thief would work this that
game is too much too much of that game
is just patience and sitting around and
waiting and sitting around and observing
patrols and finding the best time to
make your bull
[Music]
at 101 says I am sorry wrench the Dead
Rising to run does not count
we used a weapon to beat the boss let's
go again next week no I'm sorry that's
totally legit he's he's using a spiked
microphone thing it only seemed fair
and of a BB song
come back it looks like which did he did
he did indeed do it perfect runner
perfect
showing my mastery at this game now
plague getting over it I'm never gonna
be getting over it it's not that I don't
think I could it's just
I simply can't get over
[Music]

love your content by the way rich is
there any good stealth game besides
theif you can recommend
- love the first three thief games
what's it called mark of the ninja it's
a - you probably left hours ago
but you might you might see this
eventually mark of the ninja it's a 2d
stealth game that works fantastically
also for the XCOM equivalent of stealth
there's invisible ink both by the same
company oddly enough those are my
recommendations
Rexie copter zero also oh you know also
you probably know about this but
dishonored I mean that's kind of goes
