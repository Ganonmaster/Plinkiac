everyone is welcome broccoli do we do we
remember how to I was mucking about with
my car I don't like this car I find this
with the boys earlier and they wanted to
design my car so they designed this one
oh and I don't like it my dad so first
thing I'm gonna do I can't I can't see
it yet you'll see it in a second I don't
like it I think it's ugly
have we ever confirmed that it's just
cosmetic oh yeah it's all cosmetic oh
it's not that bad I don't I don't like
it I don't like it
here's what I was rocking before I I
like the car I think it's called venom
okay I go for like a darker blue the
decal I use the wings and I use a either
nearly black much darker blue or black
secondary color mm-hmm
and III rock a halo and a pirate flag
like I like a lot of them like this is a
really cool one this uh paladin but but
here's what here's what I like to do I
like to get the van put the stars on it
we go like right here like mid blue just
the deal seat up for this out yet the
DLC is out I didn't get it how much is
it I'm curious you know what I didn't
even look
because they added they edit they had it
wasn't even DLC they did add like a
course oh yeah that just came with it
like this I try to make the gaudiest
ping-pong I make the gaudiest thing
possible this is what I like to do
really I like the subtle tjak subtle
it's not like and then you know what I
like
did you get slime yet for your rocket
boost oh I hate that fucking yeah just
slime it up but then you put on the
devil horns right and then the America
flag and what you got what you got is
Texas this is my Texas man just a big
ugly van with with bull horns spewing
sludge right this is my big obnoxious
Texas fan would it be sludge or would it
be just some kind of something horrible
for the environment just smoke just pure
blacks well you know sludge is less
subtle and I'm not going for subtlety
here this is my business is my America
fuck yeah man I don't know if you've
gotten for the rocket trails there's
also grass which is kind of amusing oh
that is funny I haven't got money
I do have I do have money and I think
money's funny I like I have confetti and
I also sometimes use the green laser
bolt like if you want to go to Texas you
go for like rich oil take home Texas and
have money but
oh yeah so do I need to
do I need to create a party in order to
how do we ever figure out how to make a
private matter it does not matter here
if you do a party I'd imagine to keep
everyone together sure someone of the
chat asked missed the name there are
different colors on the slide there are
not different colors in this line you
know actually I didn't check hold on
okay I don't believe there are different
dogs on this line but if there are there
might be more unlockable if you might
have gotten it yet unless you're not
sure you have unless you have everything
unlocked oh I don't I know and there's
so much more like exhaust no is there is
there any way for for somebody who's has
the game on Steam to join your party
I would totally join the shit I thought
I had heard that they use the same
servers yeah but I don't you know I
don't know anyway I could find you I
don't know possibly if I create a
private match I can do a name and
password and that was joinable let me
fire that game up this could be great
okay hey fire it up I'll get the name
and password ready the name is prereq
all lowercase all one word no underscore
just prereq just pretty right that's
pretty good we have got the worst
president in the United States history
thank you for remembering that story
where's my story you say yeah anyone
playing on the ps4 or possibly Steam I'm
gonna make this name and password and
that's how you can join and then we'll
just we'll just change it up every once
in a while Wow god dammit Mouse I'll be
like hear utopia Coliseum that's pretty
good
prereq put on random somebody's seed
budget once I do that I'm ready I'm
ready for the passport yet okay let's
see how the password is going to be
prereq all one word oh it's the exact
same as the as the name and I just
created it I just click unable to find
server okay
hold on searching for private match in
you se okay ready
now this is joining prereq yeah
joining prereq I'm in you're in I'm in
it to win baby ice that's awesome that's
awesome that we can do this yeah there
you are charred and coals here MC Lukas
Saavik that's awesome rich that you
alright you're playing on PC I'm playing
on ps4 this is the future this is what
it always should have been
this is what it always should have been
I'm just gonna Auto
is it happening is it happening it's
happening it's gonna be hacked it can't
be hacked
you 3 V 3 V 3
no it's 4 4 4 ok some more people can't
join yeah and then you know prereq
prereq and then we'll play a couple
games and then ask badda if anyone had
its play that you drop out so other
people can join of course you know try
to make it fair button
well first touch for such bad touch is
the best game ever
yes nice score Jack my score oh fuck
yeah ok I felt good about that what the
fuck is this northern this is rocket
League it is it's a okar soccer is it
rocket car giant soccer I like to think
of them as real cars not remote-control
cars they're clearly remote-control cars
but it's it's rocket car soccer and it's
great and it's ridiculous and I'm
absolutely 100% in love with it right
now oh oh you fucker crossguard you blew
me up you son of a bitch
everyone's gonna be racing to blow you
up yeah fucking blow me up oh good job
you saved my ass
fearful sludge boy in with the save are
you on my team rich yeah I think so nice
I had the assist when you scored so I
would hold you know it like feel for if
you're full slug boys playing goalie
right now and it's like playing goalie
is always a weird thing because it works
when somebody's good I can't do it I'm
terrible at it well and you're never
quite sure if someone is gonna drop back
and play goalie so it's like you know a
lot of times I'll head back there and
someone's already there but then they'll
leave and they won't do it the whole
game for some reason I won't do it the
whole game I'm just awful at Sarah
all right sometimes the best right Oh
best strat is just to kind of hang back
oh no I missed oh nice a bridge thank
you you were there
get out of there rolling it rolling it
into enemy territory and so that's the
thing we're about this game is even do
like you can be flips and shit
and that's what makes me like kick the
ball in and it's the most fun everyone
needs to get this game and play this
game if you have ever ever loved the
multiplayer gaming if you've ever played
Mario Kart they're golden I love this
I'm shocked is this the first
multiplayer game that you've ever loved
I loved yep
I've tried multiplayer a few times and
it's always been on god I hate playing
with assholes sure like and what so what
is it about this one do you think is it
just like is it just like the quickness
of the games the kind of yeah that helps
the randomness of the like you know
because there is definitely skill
involved the uniqueness of the concept I
think helps sure
soccer with rocket cars I'm not hurt
feel first London we've got here
oh crap I overshot everything that were
shot but like there is a skill element
and there is a random luck element to it
where that ball will sometimes go crazy
places now oh shit
trying to kick it all the way I think
I'm just getting the centering pass oh
you got it you got oh well I totally
fucked a bad angle
I had a horrible end yep yep oh here we
go here we go my fucking score so fuck
off
Stassi Waker soccer so I need to say
wanker yes all the time I mean you
should just say wanker oh that's fun
wanker that's true that's true Len fly
Kaczynski we are still playing with
assholes but you know the good asshole
but that's the thing about this game
where it's like I'm sure you might be
playing with assholes and you know you
might just lose games because your
teammates suck but like it just doesn't
seem to matter as much just because it's
so fun
oh nice got it good to get it to him oh
I better get the assistant oh I got the
assist I got the assist on that check
this out toss it to you rich from half
court staff sport whiz kid that's what
we call them that's what a goalie is
nice you're what my food plate said a
food truck like what that was a full
truck this is my food truck I go fool oh
no I should have I should have hung back
and played boy that was on them I wasn't
adding I was fucking around rich and and
that was 100 percent on me I mean we're
still winning but that was doing when I
play goalie they call me the whiff so I
don't I don't I don't play goalie the
whip the whip
Saavik get off me
Oh sometimes like you you just want to
make shots that you know you physically
can yep I love it but it's just so
satisfying flipping around in shit why
I'm like the dollar sign antenna like
alright one more than and then we'll
switch out people one more then we'll
switch that people that was a good game
everybody good game gg gg gg everybody
it's car soccer no like your king is ass
oh my god
well also I'm streaming no no saving
things like two hundred and sixty-four
Nord Lum it's not just car soccer it's a
rocket car soccer that's the important
part that you need to understand
he's like because car soccer would be
interesting enough but it's a rocket car
soccer so you jump and have rocket
boosters yeah while playing soccer
standing some people online are really
good at this game that I'm not good at
this particular move but you can
actually fly up the air for a short
period of time yeah I did go and play
the tutorial am I ever going to do a
multiplayer match of XCOM against rich
no I never played X down again
it probably won't happen I'm not saying
I'm never ever ever gonna play ex-con
but it just is probably not gonna happen
if I'm gonna be honest
if I'm gonna be honest with myself and
with you
get center good center consider oh
that's a nice flavorful sludge boy read
it or do fucked up my shot I clip my
shot but that's what you're supposed to
do exactly sometimes if you make noise
it out of my face tip it down the field
on my own knocked it in saw that rich
that was look at that classic Ridge
right there it's a wall flippin magic
to some wall flippin magic oh I know
sometimes I find myself just riding on
that wall for way too long because he
can hang it back I'm hanging back but
he's kind of ganging up on that ball and
the shot emphasis MC Lukas was on that
so hard look at that look at him backing
up lining it up and boom
mr. I don't even know if I've hit the
ball once this dam and yet I still am
having fun
showers might hit the ball you because
you might hit the ball exactly
you wished I got it here I gotta hear
you help me out now I want it bad enough
if I flip hard enough I'm gonna get you
were there you weren't up you weren't up
to it
MC Lukas stepped in well I was there I
was living for back see if he missed ya
you know what you would have but it
again and yes I agree the stream is much
more fun now but we also have to play
new games too we can just you know play
we just want to be right now that's okay
as long as people like watching let's
play I think it's okay sure no it is for
now what do you know like just remember
there are new games out there and they
might be good and we need to do it can't
be one game ponies all
Oh oh my god we're how do you guys get
down the field so fast you guys are just
everywhere
ah tried to put it in what yeah and I
thought the ball might keep going a
little further so I I was like down the
field then I'd it's just like I just
whipped oh crap oh crap oh crap oh shit
oh shit
get out of here with that
no no bad angle bad angle yeah you got
it you got it out of the corner yeah I
could have had a shot I could have had
clean clear open shot oh sorry I just
knocked it out like I saw everyone
coming in for the ball I head-butted it
out into the wall everything's fine Oh
that was a sick save is there a baby
sick
hey we won again okay so anyone who was
playing dropout and and some news let's

over get over here get over here too
much over here I wasn't fast enough
that wasn't fast enough
one minute remaining it just can't be a
shutout that's the rule I mean victories
most certainly yours now all we're doing
is hoping that it's not a shutout it's
all we're doing
I shut right wait Noah right now I don't
know whatever your name is
my said we know it now oh wow okay not a
shut up not a shutout that's all we want
that's all we need but that works now
this is this is becoming embarrassing
okay
okay all I need is one goal 32 seconds
32 seconds and one doll
no you can't be done yet seven five
three two
like a UFO antenna hi one more game guys
one more game one more game and then and
then we'll switch it up again terrible
right now uh I mean I'm sure that may
mean something but oh well that you know
what that is that's disheartening when
you what you who it's like that yeah go
on go on because then you never know
what you're gonna get okay I figured
once we should be in the opposite team
just oh sure get some excitement going
well yeah we need that Oh
it's three versus three now if somebody
wants to join back in then that's weird
prereq be wreck three very right name is
prereq passport is prereq all lowercase
all one word but I jumped on it I didn't
know you were right there I kind of
stole that goal from you kind of
don't happen I do that accidentally
right but hey we're on the same team
we're all playing the same game we're
just rocket Leegin we're just rocket
Iligan you don't know what's go no
really I don't seem very blown up Jack I
know I missed it oh no oh nice block
nice block
Saavik
Oh out
who's that
fucking doohickey
Oh nice bounce
nice bounce well that was going in it's
also just amazing the amount of ball
control you can have with a
rocket-powered car no no no no oh crap
oh yeah thank you right now
you got my damn
get out of my jam rich close 100 bicycle
hit
I said well hits are hard but they're
only worth 5 points well so useless well
they're use them I stopped that momentum
with that bicycle
yep
oh nice save player 337 that was very
impressive
praise the Sun huh oh is that player
through Thursday that was a nice volley
nice volley everyone we don't lost that
point but I feel good about losing that
point yeah you earned that you all
earned that all right let's do this
Oh boom same that was me being goalie
go shopping lis hard in this game I I
think so
other people I've seen people are
extremely good at it though oh sure sure
what just means I suck I think right oh
no no no the worst save ever
oh wait Hickey wait till you see that
replay
look I'm changing it first time oh I
know but I just sit knock it out of the
way you gotta get the rebound Oh
terrible I blame myself for that
oh wait no
everybody bicycle
whoa whoa everybody we settle down Oh
team team Jack is not doing well
okay everybody drop out now Jack with
the assist layoffs Krieger
all right everybody give everyone else a
chance to play and then and then we'll
do it again
then we'll just do it again I think
everyone should get at least at least
two before they have the drop Bob didn't
we give him too I thought that was the
second some people I think what was the
first okay well yeah everyone that's a
good rule everyone gets two games yeah
two games then jump out let other people
get a chance to come in if nobody else
comes in absolutely as long as you take
a break that's a good that's a good wall
wrench I like that I like it and I like
rocket League why is this game just so
much fun oh no team rich to team jack
zero into a competition all right just
Auto it up that's that's the thing about
this game is you know that's the thing
about multiplayer gaming in general if
sometimes you just it just doesn't work
and that's you have to be ok with that
it's all worth it for that one shot for
that one play for that one
moment
No No out of the way huh you you almost
knocked it into the goal that was you
come on we got this we got this
wait no dude we checked we don't but we
might
we don't oh god oh god I'm out of juice
we're here
and I mean we were kind of all there but
yeah nice
I mean I hit it off of you and
individual but that's fun fun if you
want to take credit for that I think
that's fine that's that's acceptable
it was a team effort Jack
here we go here we go now here we go
here we go here we go now oh crap
hey bad like when it bounces off someone
all right all right we got this
oh snap it was a good shot that was just
too fast
that was straight on look at this that's
scored one on team free rec look at that
up and down I had no I have no chance to
move T prereq vs T movie Dix
I don't know I don't know if dick
neutral owns the game or what his name
would be if he does I'm just gonna say
it's Team prereq there's just t movie
experience
okay
ow fuck fuck did I miss that one hard
and you missed it - oh we all missed it
team prereq getting taken down

shutout but yeah we're losing a hard
rich and oh sorry that's okay

like the time I almost knocked it to the
goal I mean and we all saw that that's
that's not to blame oh ah fucking booyah

forgot all the things that he says in
Conan to see enemies crushed before you
the mountains crumble disease
emendations of the women the women when
you do the garden right sorry okay here

remember in Cool Runnings when they were
trying to like be like the German
bobsled team and so they'd be like I
mean but anything it's a it was from the
movie
I wouldn't help there's this really like
important part to cool roaming so
obviously like if you have been playing
to goes drop out and let someone else if
you just played one play again but uh so
this is part in Cool Runnings
where the Jamaican bobsled team sees the
German bombs the team and they're like
really ripping it up right there bobsled
in their hearts out and so they try to
copy them like the way that they start
their bobsled they go yeah I designs it
whatever German is right and and the
Jamaican bobsled team tries to do that
to try to be like them but then they
have to find their own way so then it's
feel the rhythm the other I'm come on

was a myth I think close people from
everyone I hit it I didn't win oh my god

was amazing lady terminator that was
awesome
terminators got the skills terminators
on it I'm glad that's some magic Tim Tim
movie decks I got no fucking chance no
fucking chance not against lady
terminator next round everybody versus
lady turret I don't know if we can do
that but I mean if you can I mean some
people could defect does anything just
you know they'll be the color blue but
just try to get it in your own goal and
it's lady generator versus it's not even
fair it's not even fair we're gonna look
what he does super that's a super
hat-trick that's a super that's super
awesome well no that's not a hat-trick I
got one in it's the golden sombrero we
go oh yeah don't take away my one go
rich my accidental gold lady Tomi her
still got 400
lady terminated you're insane
Oh guys look at this they just know the
diamond Fez but diamond without the hell
what's more outlandish than a sombrero
sir anything more outlandish than a
sombrero because we're beyond what
beyond sombrero for lady terminated yeah
you know what at least a sombrero is
somewhat practical at the Diamond Cat in
the Hat hat no this sounds too down
believe it that doesn't work I like the
diamond fence I think that works diamond
fest yeah because the Fez is a stupid
hat as it is it serves no practical
purpose you know like it doesn't like
protect you from the Sun or shit like
that oh my god I can't believe in this
thing you got Lady Terminator was
backing off letting us score a point
that's why the lady Terminator rested
squirrel be damned point I think I just
knocked it out of Lady terminators wave
we're defecting lady Terminator out of
the air can i play too
hey guys I got my stick ring playing
stickball right good game
oh gee yes lady Terminator was the top
get out of here you two good I love it I
said we're doing everyone versus later
two you get two you get through I know
so what are we really doing everyone
versus lady Terminator that's okay it's
a finisher all right let's not do that
well that's okay let's not do that that
sounds like a good place lady tomato
okay yeah lady Terminator gets five
goals again yeah
then it's done if everyone versus then
it's one of us and Lady Terminator
against everybody so two on four one and
everyone's a bit absurd sir
yeah you're probably right okay well the
normal game normal game normal game it's
Lady Terminator
you better get you better your five
goals this'll be me and or maybe you're
Jack and u-verse everyone else well now
there's Bernie it's really unfair
that's fine
get out of my jam guys all up in my jam
that's one come on guys let's do this
let's defend defense
oh those that about defects
no no wise for that or you know we
scored that I'm honest I don't even
notice 13 flavor this comes in a new
boom back to writing

Terminator jet off yeah oh good job now

whoever scores five goals we're against
you that's the rule
oh my god almost oh my god oh no wait
orange that doesn't count
that's - oh my god it's - I think even
Lady Terminator would say that doesn't
count because that was assisted by
claiming you know what for our purposes
it counts okay all right that's
embarrassing
when you have when you have a nice hit
and then you know like someone from the
other team assists it in
Oh No Oh No
save
either get out of here
just getting real and real out of
control get it over here get it over

I should probably pay attention enough
time that's like that's like Brett Favre

it with your rocket works less than like
doing trying to bicycle kick it did not
work take it I have not seen a bicycle
kick do anything effective well you know
like the flip I think like if you catch
it on the right part of the flip that
can really send it flying not a bicycle
not a bicycle almost never works but
it's like catching on the right part of
the flip
you got jarred jerk oh that's too hot
chart chart

you chart instead of rich ah weird it's
weird it's weird here when you say that
out loud
yeah that's normally what Karen calls me

name which is what she calls me
goodness it's not quite the equivalent
of a sweetie

gaming
okay okay
oh I was so lined up I hate that like
when when you feel like you're perfectly
lined up first - yeah at the last second
we're like oh if I would have jumped a
fraction of a second earlier
ladies her friend hit you oh she got to
watch that from underneath it was a
thing of beauty but fearful fudge boy
was there with the with the same
beautiful sludge boy amazing same sludge
boy versus the Terminator there you go
the rumble in the remote-control jungle
oh my god is that Barbara wah ba-bah
Barbarella
Barbarella someone has the name barb
around oh yeah I see that
that's cute I tried I tried I tried for
the for the oh that was close I tried
for the rocketjump I tried for the lady
Terminator yeah I tried that once I know
what I'm capable of and it's not much
shockingly shockingly little yeah oh
that was what I do I did nothing I
stopped the momentum I managed to stop
the momentum yeah
you got a touch more you got it oh my
god from the other goal assists I know
I'm getting connection issues oh yeah
are you getting connection issues yeah
something's going on oh that might be me
cuz I'm streaming it I know isn't it yes
well I know it's a glitch you think wait
yeah the camera is stuck on the ball oh
do you get disconnected I think I might
have gotten disconnected how are we
still talking well you were on skype are
you just just from the game Wi-Fi then
thought what like in a bad thing Oh know
what I'm still streaming and everything
well I'm you know what other people you
can keep playing I'm gonna take a break
I need to use the restroom oh okay I'm
gonna stop playing for a bit
okay well the hyung every been playing
this we've been playing this for oh my
god have we been playing this for two
hours it is okay one more game okay say
it same same deal just give me a second
to uh random for before in a password
prereq prereq all the same business but
give it a second here
right what we've been playing rocket
League for two hours yeah can you
believe that it felt like we were
playing the other game for three doing
this I would die if you asked me I would
say 45 minutes right he feels 45 minutes
it feels like we've been playing this
for 20 minutes like nothing we've been
playing this for two hours and I love
every single second of it every single
second
Oh Lady Terminator get out of here the
room of the room name the private room
named tree wreck all lowercase password
prereq yeah all lowercase and all want
to work yeah and the password is the
same all lowercase oh pretty right
here's here's here's my question
Chad how is the stream this is
multiplayer and we're we're just kind of
yelling about what's going on we're not
we're not talking about anything is this
a good stream I know it's fun to play
but how does this rate as a stream it's
one of those things it's time for me to
judge sure I think if you're really into
the game like I think there's some
there's some excitement having I think I
also hid it in my own goal I did Lady
Terminator I'm not gonna let you score
on my goal I'm gonna score off my Cole
how about that that was some sauce you
know I think there's like there are
these exciting moments in the game you
know and so I think as a stream it's
actually gonna be fine I I think as a
later as a like a youtube video might
not be but it all depends on what people
are looking for you know like if people
are looking for the game stream I think
they got this if they're looking for the
podcast that's a different thing
hopefully we get a nice mix of both you
know like sometimes they're gonna get a
more podcast episode yet oh elite says
negative 100 of 100 how we rate string
yeah yeah this is one where we probably
could have used like could have used a J
or a Josh or something in order to kind
of chat about shit while we're point and
and and yes yes guy I remember meeting
somebody at a Culver's somebody who met
me in public
apparently is in the chat tonight hello
hello you manager coffee
you saw me said hey yeah you rich Evans
oh my god I'm rich that one's like that
cancer we're radical process great
I didn't know if this is gonna be
another another let me show you my
Wendy's head no no my am I gonna regret
that Wendy's ad story for the rest of my
life yes quite possibly forever it was a
very funny story
and we're all very thankful that you
shared uh-huh uh-huh fuck off you just
fuck off right now yep
and I agree with your conclusion that I
think you know maybe only one of us
should be playing at a time yeah well
that's what I see in the channel but at
the same time also people often asked
for us to play I had too much fun not to
do this I'm sorry no no you know what
rich we're gonna get we're gonna get
both this made my night it should have
it's a great game a great fuckin game
but I think what we're telling people
here is you're gonna get both you're
gonna get games like this where we're
all we're doing is wing a nine and then
you're gonna get stuff like I mean last
Wednesday when Josh was there I don't
think we mentioned the game once you do
when you have Josh and Jake yeah and by
the way I like both and you know we try
to tell people like if it's if it's a
hack and half you're probably gonna get
something more like this if it's a group
stream you're probably gonna get more
podcasting yeah and we'll try to just
keep you
bicycle kick
why
oh yeah something I've been recon and
I'm flying it didn't do me any good
probably want a full rocket dish yeah
for maximum impact for maximum fly age
who is Josh you know Josh from best Oh
doors
I think it's joke somebody asked that
last time is it a joke or because he
hasn't been in much lately
it's my guess
now lady turn oh no that's our goal oh
my god I got confused as side I was on
no and so I was going for that goal -
and I was like did Lady Terminator just
score goal for us how long has he been
playing just a fucking seat I have
definitely been playing just too long
and this might be the last game it's
getting like what what is the Wendy's
story you know you know I like the minor
league baseball I am one year me and
Karen had season tickets and we just
happen to have season tickets right in
front of this other couple this guy and
his his fiancee mmm if I wasn't fiance I
wasn't even engaged to her yet but
anyway
and we just were friendly and it was
like you know being Karen didn't have a
couple couple friends so we're we're
gonna show me with these people and it's
like after a game we wanted to do
something together and we stopped by his
place first I forgot why but he invited
us into their place to look around and
on his wall there it was a framed
Wendy's ad and it's like why the fuck do
you have a framed Wendy's head it's this
kid with like just dressed up like a
90's kid this was like an ad for the
night he's got like the backwards
baseball cap and the clothes that are
way too bright he's got a big smile on
his face and holding like a bag of
Wendy's or something like that I said I
was being he was in a Wendy's ad but it
was a kid he's got it frame was like why
would you hold on to that he was proud
of it is like oh this is the thing I did
when I was a kid I think what I would do
if I had an ad like a print ad with me
and I don't want that I know about
anything no I'd be ashamed of my Wendy's
app you I know I said this is gonna be
the last one but we should probably do
one more yeah the story is us no because
at the time on camera I didn't want to
drag Karen into it I left that out which
is what gave Mike is opening well well
hmm it's a great I mean it's a great
story and it's a ridiculous story so
this is this is it for real guys though
this is the last one
oh you chewing one more
mr. blood says he'd be proud of his
Wendy's em but he'd be ashamed of this
our piece of his are be sad
one of the recent bests of the worst one
before last one or did you devil theory
was well yeah I was within the last
three or four
well you know they'll move together it
was it was I think I think it was the
last we loved worst because it was that
bad video with the kids who were being
forced to sing yes alright the reason I
brought the Wendy's add ups cuz he was a
kid how do these kids react about the
beam on brushes with Fame they had when
they were kids you know how do how do
they react to this when they grow up
this guy who was in a Wendy's head just
talked about the story
I'm sorry that was yours I took that I
took that shot away from you
it's still great storage and we all
appreciate you telling it to us and
telling it to us again
someone Dino Selena no besides I could
kind of tell the story without Mike
being an asshole and accusing you of
yeah nefarious acts with
my brain is on cocaine rich cocaine
basically but it's good
wavered or I'm not get in there get in
there get in there
I do find that like after probably an
hour so my eyes start to hurt because
I'm paying so much thank you
lucky lucky strike so this is my Sankar
is awesome
you should watch the next World Cup you
know that excitement you get when you
when you you know what an excitement you
get when you get a goal yeah that's what
you feel that's what you live that you
feel with real games only gets a million
times more intense I do here's the thing
turn very much into soccer and yeah she
loves soccer she played when she was in
high school and I've gone to games
though because they got the the Chicago
Fire the MLS team they play and it's
it's fun enough to play but it's so
boring to watch so boring to watch for
me I have been
I shot a video for the World Cup in
Africa and while I was in Africa you
went to a game and saw a World Cup match
at like one of the new fancy stadiums
and it was a big match yeah everyone was
excited and screaming
the three of us who were there to make
the videos sat through the whole match
yup drank beers and never ever once
understood why people yelled at anything
there is absolutely no way to convince
me that soccer is ever ever exciting and
it's just because I don't understand
people like what they like I just don't
think it's very exciting to watch like
hockey works cuz it's got the speed edie
hockey you feel like somebody could
score any given moment
that's soccer you feel like somebody may
or may not score this game right more so
how dare you compare this lovely game
about cars with rockets on that until
you're boring this is sorry I'm sorry
I'm sorry if you don't like that this is
soccer no and it's proof that I think
soccer is a fun enough game to play it's
fun
that guy could be very exciting people
in Europe but like us and they love they
love the soccer just and I know you take
your soccer bear or your football very
seriously
yeah don't get it
not my and my and mine is quoting me
says soccer is boring to watch that he
says continues to play soccer and stream
rich Evans then again I was playing
soccer on the stream not watching I'm
not even really watching bowel I'm
reading the chat also this isn't soccer
this is rocket car
this is raggedly soccer soccer players
don't have jetpacks that fly up with the
air they don't have jetpacks they can't
smash into each other they you know how
long do these games last three minutes
Jack can you flip onto your back and
take five before this game is over take
a dive I think it's red no no what's the
name flopping yeah oh yeah the flop
I'm pretty sure these are supposed to be
RC cars and that's why the ball is like
a normal-size ball Jack Jets
just for his own personal fantasy wants
to believe that their actual cars yeah
yeah hey I think it's clear they're
supposed to be RC cars oh there 100
there definitely supposed to be our
cigars I like to think that they're real
cars in this giant soccer ball that's
fine whatever whatever works
all fuck you learn over time yeah I'm
super duper
how much as mike wants to know how much
this game cost it was 20 yeah yeah I
want to say was 20 and I got this for
free because I'm a PS Plus member and so
it's part you know PS plus is like
opposed idli it's not available on
PlayStation Plus Lamar I've heard some
said that out of how true it is so I but
I got it when it was
my legs my leg I'll uh I do love though
I don't much care for soccer I love
seeing the videos of the people who are
like notorious poppers oh yeah you know
mr. Kyle just posted a link to a gift
some guy who gets lightly tapped on the
head yeah and instantly comes out of the
ground that's fine
that would pitch like I think that's if
if I were a fan of the sport that would
just piss me off tonight
even if someone on my team
I am like the top hat all right
for real now though for real man now
we're done yeah because if anybody has
really done this with RC cars in a
soccer ball oh I wonder if that was the
genesis you know if you could make them
jump if you could make the RC cars so
obviously they wouldn't you wouldn't
have the rocket aspect of things but you
could still try and play soccer with our
C cars
sure
I'm controllably accident I didn't say
this game is free MP well I guess I did
say it was free MPs play this game as
part of PS Plus what you pay and I mean
I did mention that you pay the
subscription but I know it's funny to
say it's free on PS Plus but you have to
pay for okay that's not let's see here

steam oh yeah I know it steams the way
to get it because then you could get the
