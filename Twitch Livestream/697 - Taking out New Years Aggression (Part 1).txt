dream denied astray I'm doing a strand
mass Truman what are those things I wait
I forgot one important thing I didn't
tell I'm playing I didn't tell him
doom I didn't tell the show doom the
game in a little camera thing that's
what I didn't do I didn't do I would the
second most important thing that's not
shocking I'm a dumbass and I was doomed
where's Tim I'll find out soon enough
how's everyone doing as you tonight as
you how's your evening how's your new
year as your fucking new year and the
celebrities done dying
did you know celebrities died did you
know old people die where's Karen she's
at home she had better things to do than
watch me played doom all right is that
not showing the doom in the window show
do him in the window conf larget like
Newton Game Capture properties you know
what any full screen application which
seems to be hit or miss but maybe it'll
be hit that's done you playing the thing
though you're not showing the thing you
know showing the right thing dad why you
oughta I ought to do thing properties
all right you don't want to do any full
screen application apparently specific
window do what's wrong with doom why
don't you want to show the door show the
do them on the streams so the doom can
be the thing that is seen
all right let's do a full brute force
here display capture
yeah I guess that works yeah sure why
not
Oh laptops too so I can read things
online
okay alright let's stay at the campaign
I want to beat the shit up tonight
Thank You forestry I know you're welcome
it's gonna be a lousy rich heaven solo
stream because I ain't got people to
talk to yes Karen stream with me last
night
the stream is available to watch on the
interwebs that's a thing it's pretty
dark hats fine everything's fine what's
wrong nothing's wrong everything's fine
Jake is Jake is still on vacation taking
a long-ass vacation but that's that's
what Jack does he did it last year - oh
that's the lousy stream isn't it that's
like a fucking freeze-frame
was this streaming like shit or was that
just me my monitor it looked like a
slideshow
was it a slideshow
no the stream was good okay okay I'm
looking at my monitor look like if
you're getting like five frames a minute
all right
except my mouse doesn't want to move
oh great yeah we're gonna we're gonna
need to jack up the sensitivity here oh
my god that's too much we'll deal with
it
all right what's what's wrong what's
wrong come on Mouse come on don't be a
jerk
what's the can I what's the default
obviously I accidentally hit a key that
I didn't want to hit at some point yeah
what are you bound to press none oh my
god that's a problem sorry I set this up
like really fucking quickly you amusing
were you
what does that bound to that doesn't
make any sense
I think that's my chaingun Ubuntu
weapon well I don't need the friggin
weapon wheel
that works
where's the other guy the other guy is
on vacation he will be back he should he
should be back next stream
yes Ulrich Evans I'm just gonna shoot
shit that's the plan I played this
before he has we did a full review on it
I love this game
Sarah Chen did I get the thing it
depends upon what you sent me it's been
about two days since I've been to the
PIO box
I'm going tomorrow I will know more then
I used to playing over this mouse just
playing it here yes
I was dumb that's always satisfying
I'm sorry I'm gonna be quiet I apologize
ahead of time
and the jump didn't shit happens
oh yeah oh yeah
ooh what the hell happened there
get all the armor get all guns urn up
the volume on the game I can do that
Karin would have been nice or you know
what I could if it's unacceptable that
I'm alone I can just end the stream in
disgrace jay is not here
Karin is not here Jack is on vacation
you got me and I'm sorry I am so sorry
alright I'll turn off the game and then
I will shoot some things game volume is
fine I don't know
please no all right here I'll turn it
down a little bit okay
hey fuck you little prick
how embarrassing
I failed to climb up the thing
why am i so bad
why am I so bad tonight it's my favorite
weapon in this game
well Shane gun is always fun though
it's got a different name it's not
called the burl gum railgun but it's
basically the railgun what the hell is
that thing called in this the quantum
can't quantum something I forget what
they call it but that's enjoyable to use
I really need to play around with my
sensitivity somes I'm having some got a
mild issues mild but it's fine it's fine
go scan and that's it
whatever may she's a stupid mousepad
probably the sensitivity
that's happy - OH
it's gotta be a reason I'm so much worse
at the studio I don't know what that
reason is but I'm sure it exists there's
another one
no it's too you fuckers
slightly nervous because people are
watching at this point I don't think so
the comforts of home might have
something to do with it
yeah this point I've been in front of a
camera enough I dub that's it
that's not right
oh Jesus Christ
you
remember one likes the explosive shot I
think the other ones pretty good too
yeah all right that mouth one that's
that's the best against the imps that's
the best one - to get to rip somebody's
jaw
you know for the charge burst first well
the explosive one I'll give you this in
the next stage
it makes the kill multiple the unwilling
and kill multiple ones in one shot
it makes that easier
all right it's like that
jack-jack should be around next stream
that's always a good thing for me to
have somebody to talk to Jack and jacket
on he doesn't need me to talk Jack and
talk on a sub will stream I can at least
certainly not when plants up my doom
huh
yeah I'm stuck on that thing
get up there get up days ah damn it
all right
I always satisfied 100% of the time
that's satisfying you should have got
this during the Steam sale you fuckin
should've game of the year for for what
for what my opinion is worth this her ex
come to what honestly as much as I'm an
ex-con guy everyone knows I love XCOM
I'm not sure if I like XCOM to more than
this
doom new doom fucking awesome fucking
fucking awesome so 14 hours left in the
Steam sale and it's 20 bucks on Steam
yeah yeah good time good time pick it up
honestly
it this is fucking great
all the secrets we did good very good
what's fuckin awesome Dhoom Dhoom is
fuckin awesome
did I ever get dizzy when playing doom
I've never got dizzy when playing this
doom I did get a bit motion sick playing
brutal doom just just look up video
games and motion sickness online there's
a whole lot of people with a bunch of
different theories and solutions any all
or none of which may work for you one
who saves the frame rate the field of
view who knows
it was
yep
you don't need that arm deep there you
go
you don't have a good PC right now or
you'd be buying doom as someone else in
the chat just said brutal dooms pretty
decent that might run good for him
supposed to say previously recorded
we're watching its previously recorded
message there is a one in a billion
chance that one of the Deb's is a fan
and put that in but highly unlikely I
got that shit I used to blue
more than one around this corner come on
there you go where're you guys that
don't be shy why are they all
it's easy to fall off that legend died
yeah this whole stream just gonna be
begone gonna be me going yeah
whoa whoo shit like that
yes
fuck
not down disengaged
I'm not gonna throw away any anime you
gift to me I might not watch it but I'm
not gonna yeah he's stupid and throw it
in the trash Jesus Christ you people
have a low opinion of me
oh wait
fuck let's not ripping as we're
and I'm not playing optimal I'm doing
okay
basically I could be kicking more ass
so trees on Mars what could you possibly
cut with a chainsaw demons demons you
know in Doom 3 there's a log you can
find that tries to explain that they
said it's the wrong shipment I asked for
Jack Evans or something
yeah absolutely
yeah I'm spending far too much time here
getting my ass kicked I'm not happy with
it not happy with my play tonight
not happy with my play tonight that was
awful I mean everyone's dead I'm not
still that was awful should you buy do
more GTA 5 spent some on how you feel
about in their series what are you in
the mood for they're both good
I'm fan of GTA 5
sorry chené chené doom this doom is fine
you don't need to do one with mods do
one with mods is also good they're both
fine choices but this game gets a big
recommendation from me
yeah Duma will do one with mods at this
point is practically free there isn't
really a good reason not to get both oh
yeah
and obviously I'm getting all of the
secrets that I remember
I will read tips between levels
oh wait
I'll do that no oh yeah I gotta go down
here that's right
alright that you can't pick up ammo for
a gun you don't have yet for shame
what did I think of a pp-2000 was that
that the first one they made it was yeah
less than satisfying wasn't the worst
thing I've ever seen I never saw the
second alien vs. predator so there you
go there's my full opinion on the AVP
series I did a commentary track on the
first one
play the Harvard's Dumont I already have
actually on stream even
am I so bad tonight why why
where'd you go where'd you go there yeah
I got that now put a smile on your face
I'm blocking your access to the facility
scanner come to the Vega terminal and
he'll give you what you need constantly
adding new stuff luck arcade buddy I
think this game was a success certainly
got good reviews mine was one of them
the other one where's the third one
where'd you go you little fucker alright
alright
it's where there was another one he got
away
he got away
and never ever gets old
good none better gonna didn't
it's a gift take it it will give you
strength help you on your journey if you
can withstand the power surge
yes I've played this before all the way
through a few times
and transforming 64% of all you may see
employees into the creatures you see
roaming throughout the facility the rest
were killed by the demons released from
their holding cells my Olivia appears
I feel I should apologize for what's
happened here some of my boys took
things too far
Olivia was the cause of all this you may
not agree with our research but know
this we exploited hell and its resources
because it was in mankind's best
interests to do so what you now see in
this facility is the cost of progress
Calvin the gun said hey rich have you
ever played Star Wars The Old Republic
it's free you fuck oh great
now I haven't no I don't care
and apparently I'm caught up in tips
it's the only one I saw so yeah you know
it's fine
it's been free for a while hasn't it
that one
yes solo today jack is still on vacay
check should make his glorious return
next room
to collect Aaron after running
Diagnostics on the suit it appears that
I can accelerate the upgrading of your
arsenal the facility will not allow you
access to the turbine room unless the
demonic threat level is broke down
inside the foundry our security systems
cannot be
I've got
oh shit Oh fine
on over towards the barrel
you get weapon upgrade points for doing
things I'd cook three of these guys with
one barrel I get a weapon upgrade point
so uh-huh mission accomplished
oh I almost died doing it I am off my
game tonight
one of the objective is I gotta kill
three of those guys in a certain way
nope not that way did the wrong thing
buddy
well that was unsatisfying I want the
full animation he didn't explode good
look at that but not that button I'll
ship bitch
what's wrong with me buddy
that better days
loke p85 says Richard what is your doom
strategy I don't kill all the demons I
don't kill all the demons should I kill
all the demons yes my strategy is I kill
all the demons aggressively harshly
brutally and it's pretty good there you
go
how come I need to restart the tip thing
to read the new tips it's it's some fury
a ting it's infuriating eyes tells yes
sir Chen says even more random
conversational topics time so how'd you
spend your New Year's Taiwanese hotpot

sighs duration alliteration

fucking imp
many delicious ways to kill things
they're all fun playing the would you
three no I have not
I'm sure it's great have an OCD thing
where I would want to play the complete
the games in order and I did not like
The Witcher 1
I hate this jump
not bad not bad
demonic threat reduced by 25%
I get across there yeah
ah that's where that's the way to do it
it was a demon over there
where you at
there I got the thing
yeah I'll do this one
ooh nice
now
the original theme yeah it shows up in
places they played the original music to
do it's great
big battle hold up and I got a thing in
my eye
that's more like it
who's the real monster obviously that's
me no remorse none
Oh what am i holding onto these for what
am i saving it for
double-barrel shotgun so you'll have
enough
we're done
hey big guy was rubble
where to think of dead space that space
is okay it was not my favorite thing
ever but I enjoyed it
yep
stop
soon I guess because I'm streaming I'm
actually getting some slow down here
which I'm not used to getting in this
game
I'm going to go now just yeah yeah
she dead
Oh
why am I so bad day
that was kind of fun
you might want to rebind jumpers I keep
hitting the wrong dim god ship
Bastien
oh well that
there's an athlete
nope you're dead alright leave that
cutter I'm better I'm playing like shit
tonight haven't died yet but I'm playing
like shit tonight
authorization Bolivia
Pierce alpha 4:02
she is trying to tear open the portal a
few times they forced you to watch story
stuff that's all right
nothing I'd skip it anyway
you could not
that chick is creepy yes it's this
fucking point
the system won't allow anyone but Olivia
to Allah said now we will have to shut
down the Archon tower manually from the
surface what's going on
now that our cave mode all the story
stuff gets skipped that's interesting
that's actually really interesting and
that's apparently have to restart the
entire freaking touchpad source thing
first thing is there a cursor touchpad
anything touch pin hate touch
there's nothing this doesn't there's no
cursor this this things things garbage
it's no pants garbage Oh
and I have not missed any tips so we're
good just useless it's actually useless
hate it ah mr. secret
damn I know exactly which one oh well
that hurts
Olivia is using the tower to drill a
doorway into their world
you can prevent her from opening the
gate by disabling the tower induction
filters Oh
the sucks of the pistol sucks I know you
gonna upgrade the pistols the pistols
still ship upgraded
and I bet
yeah
I remember I was doing for a second
there and then I remembered its killed
Vince
what I'm doing is killings
Oh fuckin I'm fuckin a bad fucking the
bad
why am i fucking up so bad why am i so
awful tonight now that I'm doing
terrible
whoa okay someone was standing by a
barrel nope nope
see I'm playing like crap
fuck me fuck me
put my room now that room bedroom is
garbage
all right come over here where I can
jump on your head
before something up nope he's dead
tense fucking intense I love it
I am legitimately flying on garbage
where is the bald one what as opposed to
the bald England
jack is on vacation still he should be
back next stream we're going health or
armor I have a good reason for wanting
armor
but that's not for a while anyway we'll
start with hell for now
rich could have used this stream a
better shooter like painkiller you could
have used better grammar
we were only temporarily disabling the
tower you need to remove each lens
individually carefully release the
hinges destroying the production of
archerd energy isn't necessary yeah sure
it is
coke
segi chan says hi wretch I'm trying to
get into FTL for the first time do you
recommend starting with advanced
features enabled if you're a newbie
here's the thing advanced advanced
features were an option when I was a
newbie that was added later so I haven't
ever been a noob with the advanced
features I don't I don't I don't think
it would make it much more difficult
yeah that someone else in the chat is
right I think the biggest the biggest
thing would be starting an easy don't
start on normal normal on FTL is
basically really fucking hard they
should have named them differently
Oh bad bad time to be having an off
night I can't hit shit
yeah
Morty Morty yes cloaking module was
available in the FTL standard edition
you could cloak easy should become
doable normal normal is very doable I
was it was they don't know
check out this stuff I think this Ronis
half-decent Dazed & Confused is bad
vacuum sucks here's here's where the
rooms give you like a extra little power
you earned them by doing those challenge
things I just did that first one I got
earlier was vacuum one increase the
range you could absorb dropped items I'm
not wasting a slot on that I didn't
bother to equipment but here dazed and
confused increases how long decent
demons remain is a staggered state
that's a good one
that one's actually really good alright
I'm so pissed I missed that one
collectible
absolutely livid I am livid I tells his
all right and if I jump on enough demons
head heads I can upgrade the dazed and
confused rumors but he needs to get
closer so I could freaking jump on his
head right yup yeah you just die you
prick you prick
fucking demon typical fucking demon
right am i right
chainsaws full but looking at the screen
and not and well looking at the chat and
I'm the game
the hardest difficulty in FTL should
preclude pausing should disable pausing
then then you incentivize certain
strategies like like you incentivize
drone ships and then you make the normal
difficulty it's kind of more limited
because you avoid certain types of
weapons I don't know about that
what are we doing what am I forgetting
oh yeah up there I need to go up
where all the demons
a shotgun gather up your hello
oh yeah ah
this way there you go
break fuckin face
you're probably good on ammo
but I do want secrets I'm gonna be one
upgrade point short of fully upgrading
the super goddamn shotgun because I
missed that secret aren't I
I know it it's just it's it's a fact
don't fuck no fuck me I'm doing guy
fucking doom guy
all right upgrade yep um too short
well that sucks
do you reach detected next
oh fuck
yeah
yeah we play bad bad
there we go
we got that down do
bound to something down
I find it there it's fine
I love this hell god fucking this badly
we've been decades perfecting the
science selling it to humanity we
balanced their Hill energy with our
science making it usable and safe and we
solved an energy crisis the world had no
answer for it works you cannot do this
like Hayden he's got a good voice and
yes you're right he's totally Ultron
he's James he's ripping off James Spader
but you know what it fucking works
that's a fun little section I think I'm
getting my doom legs back oh I should
have said that shit the fuck inside that
I'm gonna regret saying that
no rocket launcher blesser meme no I'm
not a big fan of Splash Damage I'll take
a shotgun over the chains over the
rocket launcher any day
you'll notice I use the rocket launcher
very little
how is there no singleplayer deal see
for this hey whatever I'm glad I don't
have to pay more to get the full game I
can do multiplayer DLC all I want I'd
rather have a full sequel than
multiplayer DLC anyway
jump up you don't fucking jump up on the
thing jump up get up to the get up in
there that the platform there you go
Wow I was trying to kill both of them
with one shot if I do that 25 times with
the double-barreled shotgun I get the
final upgrade so I tried to do a thing
and that demon mauled me because I tried
to do it which is fine he's a demon I
understand why he would want to do that
which way is the egress this way this
way is the egress
ninety-four
how do you survive that you prick
Carolyn he just dropped dead at the
sight of me difficulty is this I think
it's a normal hurt me plenty I'm pretty
sure unless I fucked up when I set the
game up but now feels like hurt me
plenty
is stopping our energy production is
what you want then you need only to
destroy this last filter that argent
energy will no longer exist in this
solar system we will be back at square
one
Hayden's got a point
having enough energy for everybody is a
big deal
part of the Middle East is a fucking
mess don't play on hard rich I played a
kick-ass normal it I get the kick ass
without of feeling like hand-holding as
it probably would uneasy I'm fine with
this oh no I did I did miss something
something big too
all right
let's not use my touchpad to do things
because touch Paradis I hate this laptop
so much if you haven't noticed
I turned it on and it shut itself off
right away
and nothing s that it's not working
right there at least I don't know what
what's going on here but I needed to
restart the tip program every time I
want to I need to close and and turn
back on the Tippin program every time I
want to refresh the tips which fucked up
Scuba Steve 1795 says rich Happy New
Year hearing you get angry at yourself
every time you fuck up is all the
entertainment a man needs in this world
keep paying yourself
lol dangled my dingle are you thank you
very much scoop Steve
primary access points to the tower were
destroyed in the explosion the pipeline
disciplined daddy says rich I know
you're not reading this but you made me
want to play X come on classic and it's
hard and I hate you now classic
difficulty on
XCOM anywhere then it's a real kick to
the fucking nuts when you start playing
it you will learn better strategies and
you will become a better XCOM player
trust me I I went through the same damn
thing where I started playing on classic
as normal felt too goddamn easy and it
was like getting kicked in the nuts it's
it's the biggest jump I don't I never
finished a game and impossible does I
don't know it's a little bit too much
classic feels right but impossible
didn't feel going from classic to
impossible didn't feel like as much of a
jump as going from normal to classic did
reven ed
taking a lot of risk because I want to
level up the double-barrel shotgun
probably shouldn't it should probably
just moto I say I forgot the name of the
person who was having the problems with
XCOM classic difficulty try hanging
around the official XCOM forums or
possibly even the steam forums and look
for people giving advice I'm here I'll
tell you this much the the single most
helpful piece of advice you get from
going from XCOM Normal difficulty to
classic here's the thing with the
difficult to jump normal there's a lot
of hidden things in your favor like when
it's it might say you have like a 50%
chance to hit but that's a lie unlike
normal and easy it's really like a 60%
chance day like you're getting like a
secret 10% bonus with both your aim and
the other way around with the enemies
they have 10% worse aim the thing I
learned that's really helpful for
classic difficulty and XCOM enemy within
low cover the half shield is is damn
near fucking worthless it's better than
nothing but if you're stuck behind half
cover consider hunkering down you really
want the high cover before you can even
start to feel safe and you're not safe
then but that's the biggest thing with
going to classic you learned that low
cover and high cover is very important
that the distinction high covers a lot
better the full shield the full shield
is a lot better than the half shield
kill things kill things
chainsaws for
I hate this challenge
where's it went out where does everyone
at now I hate this challenge yeah
nope nope
I hate that one
that's not the reason it's not a rapper
yes it
many double kills to upgrade
I got 2120 one more night of 30
yes
right fallen dive
I hate the platforming
instant kills that aren't all related to
combat I hate platforming
yep facing the wrong way
alright one of the challenges is I got a
I got to glory kill three of those imps
from behind and his back was facing the
abyss that wasn't gonna work
so I'm trying to stagger imps but not
too close to the freaking edge because I
don't want to fall to my goddamn doom
did
damnit line up line up 11 of 30
you know if anything I want to upgrade
I can't get back here anyway
accumulators
no she's getting away I didn't get there

that's the assumption I'm gonna run
under
turtle wise says hey fella late to the
stream what are you pissed about hope
all is well sir fuck my massive beanpole
all right I'm not I'm not like super
pissed I was I was distraught the other
day I'll say this again I said this last
night I'll try and I'll try and say this
quicker this time you know I've been
trying to do a XCOM classic difficulty
no troops lost run trying to get through
with not a single name on the memorial
wall I'm a triumph like two fucking
months and I just can't do it like a few
days ago I had like the best
XCOM run of my life everything was going
well my troops were kicking ass I got to
the overseer mission which I don't know
if you're not familiar the ExComm once
you're once you get once you do the
overseer mission you're like one or two
research projects and building cue from
finishing the game on the overseer
mission I lost a troop due to bullshit
on that bullshit I mean I guess
technically I made a mistake but really
it was bullshit I brought some ghost
grenades with me in case things went bad
and I uncovered a sector pod which
basically an XCOM those are huge
powerful tanks and like oh shit second
pod what do I do well I got my ghost
grenades so I had people everyone take a
shot at it and then I had my assault run
up get a good rapid fire on it brought
itself down a little bit but psychopaths
are tough and it still had plenty of
life left so I tossed uh I had my one
true but didn't have movements you have
she tossed that Ghost grenade on
everybody and we were all in stealth
then the frig insecto pod walks Chloe he
walks past where my troops are and my
assault he had the close combat perk if
you don't play XCOM the close combat
perk that gives you a free shot to enemy
any enemy that moves within four tiles
except I didn't want to take any kind of
shots I
to stay in stealth mode so the second
pod walks by my assault foolishly shoots
at it
this dick damage to the second pod gets
revealed from stealth and then critted
from the second pod who was literally
standing right next to him I lost that
troop and it was like a knife knife
right to my gut day is worth of playing
best
XCOM are in my life thought I was
finally gonna get through the full game
without losing a single goddamn troop on
classic difficulty and it all went down
the drain thanks to freakin the close
combat perk and that's why I played doom
it was mind doing let off steam from
that never taking the close combat perk
again it's bad late-game once you have
ghost armor and ghost grenades
tried to explain that last night I think
I spent 20 minutes talking about XCOM
mechanics
oh yeah we have
down there whoa behind me
yes

here somewhere music still playing where
are you at
