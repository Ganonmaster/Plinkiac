[A] down and there's your heart rate I'm
going to try to get Zen we mentioned
your heart rate can everybody see Jax
can everyone see our heart oh my god I
had no mic and I'm a scream alright
there we go
there we go I was dumb that was fair
that was a rookie mistake
rookie mistake rich so heart rate heart
rate we could see your heart rate and
already I'm freaking out
this was Rich's grand grand idea the
heart ometer which I which I love I love
the heart ometer hi oh hi everybody hi
everybody
the only thing it needs is sound effects
needs a dude well dude remember it
yelled at us really I don't know why but
it yelled at us because you took it off
thought you were dead
welcome welcome to Jack builds his PC
stream you have never built a PC before
I have never built a PC before I am
freaking out a little bit and then rich
had this idea to hook up this heart
monitor which is on my toe right now so
I have a thing which camera am I looking
at I have a thing on my toe right now
that is giving you that live heart rate
my B beats per minute I have no idea
like what's normal but I feel stressed
out yeah yeah you should you should give
this you know any mistake jack it's a
very expensive mistake any mistake is
gonna be okay so what do I do with this
well that that that is for static
electricity like if you touch like your
mother borrowed your video card or
something yeah it you get an electric
shock that might fuck some shit up
mm-hmm so you put that around your wrist
and then the other end you you have to
ground yourself some kind of metal
that's touching the ground I think you
can you guys think you can't just clap
it under the case if the case is metal
yeah and you'll be fine
oh okay
oh okay and rich is gonna be my helper I
have all of my things over here and a
lot of them are not even open so this is
like this is like unboxing Street this
is also an unboxing stream and you and
you'll get to see all of my fun my super
fun stuff so that is that is your case
here is my gorgeous case where I think I
say this exactly step one pour coffee
all over motherboard why is your drink
there as soon as the actual electronics
come out my drink is going away but I
haven't finished it yet
and so I I want to UM I want to have it
there because coffee comforts me because
I'm addicted to coffee I did have this
open Irie Irie package this because
there were some things that I weren't
quite sure fit
I'll see you you you had this on already
a little yeah like this I opened already
but look at this absolutely gorgeously
I'm super excited cameras focused
entirely on the white board I want to
move that over a bit I'll move the case
over here
for everyone out to see close-up you
know I think this is a better one look
at this tiny tiny case this is glass
you're a flat lining huh you're
flatlining oh my god I'm dead oh my god
I'm dead hold on wake up
I have to wiggle my toes hold on let me
work on my toes a little bit
do you have diabetes right you bout to
lose a toe oh my god I might be losing a
toe hold on everybody here look at my
sweet ass case Jack you're getting F to
the chat what F oh yeah so pay respects
thank you chat oh god there it is
breathe deep
I did take it off for a second breathing
deep I'm dead I'm sorry it's not gonna
stop beeping I'm sorry I'm dead hold on
it'll stop it stopped before jack has no
circulation is like you should be
standing up more I know no I should be
there we go now we're getting it again
so here's my here's my super beautiful
case this is glass under Heat and Ethier
obviously I'm not taking off the
protective foam until we are further
done in the bill but look at how tiny
and beautiful this case is I'm super
super excited about this and then look
like check this out this just snaps off
you can just like pull off the side
oh that's clear case yeah it's glass and
so it's got it's got a protective sheet
on it I did not find my last case but
you didn't get any of the lighting I
don't want the lighting I don't why you
get a glass case you can still see the
innards it's still beautiful you can
still see the beauty but I think LED
lights are lame so I'm not doing that
here's the here's the inside guts
he was the inner guts pretty small and
then here you can also pop out this side
for for feasibility of building and yeah
it's hard to like figure out the right
angle to show you guys this button
anyway it's so tiny no you guys this is
so tiny you know here is it here's the
remote control for our TV to give you
like some concept I don't have a proper
thing to give you scale but this is a
remote control this is how tiny the
cases I think your hands probably a
decent size
well they I might have giant hands or
tiny hands they don't know they don't
know what kind of hands I have
but that's how big it is so super super
exciting and I'm so nervous
85 86 beats per second or someone figure
out what unnormal beat per second is
fluctuating you've hit the 90s you have
been as low as 270 I think you're just
excited Jack I'm sure you guys have no
idea how excited I am and nervous I am
to build this live why is it so tiny
because I want something that looks
pretty and the way my desk is set up at
work I don't have a ton of space and I
want to make sure everything is clean
and beautiful so I got a tiny beautiful
thing that I can put on top of my desk
he thinks it's pretty I think it's so
pretty it's so pretty can I just do this
like does that work just do it to the
case just over to the case okay I mean
right it doesn't matter I think like
where are you gonna be working mostly
and look for the camera setup I have no
idea where I'm gonna be working mostly
rich because I've never built a computer
before I don't even know what I'm using
people could see the things so like I'm
imagining do this come on over here
camera yeah there we go
yeah we can work with that a little more
easy so then I'll be doing like this see
this and you guys can see me and rich
and great well I'm not gonna hand you
the next thing you ask me the next thing
and I'll get it for you what wait you're
supposed to help me I'm your own Jack
what you're on your own rich I don't
know what I'm doing I thought you did
the research well now all my parts fit I
don't know how to put them on you didn't
research this you didn't read up no oh
my god why was I supposed to yeah like
well I figured you know why cuz I
figured I figured that you know the
chats are gonna be helpful obviously
obviously the chats gonna know what to
do oh well just like what order what
order do
what are you going you know do you do
motherboard motherboard motherboard
heatsink first motherboard
well you might born I put the processor
in the motherboard right do you have
like what do you have for cooling you
have a fancy fan oh I can fit a fancy
fan I do I have a very fancy fan okay
where I don't I don't know what you're
even doing Yeah right here bring me my
motherboard and my fancy fan we'll just
start there how about that
oh yeah start by putting CPU into
motherboard sure sure
CPU yep solid staid get my giant ass
super fancy fan god what is this wait
till you see this thing wait till you
see this thing it's not time for that
yet
it's great great here's my motherboard I
had to do the one thing I really really
had to double check now do you need to
put mounting screws in your case for the
motive work first or does already have
mounting screws there already has
mounting screws here okay and then I
believe they are right here yep great
hey guys this is we're gonna take it
easy and we're all gonna settle down
specifically me I'm gonna settle down
with a medal I am very worried that you
did not like like read a guide first on
the steps in the order and what very I'm
very surprised it'll be fine I did thank
you whoever whoever suggested I go to PC
part picker yep thank you for that
because I was I was starting to get
really worried that like what if what if
it I just can't plug shit into other
shit no cuz you assume where it's like
everything is basically kind of the same
yeah but you know and then someone
mentioned PC part picker which I didn't
even know was a thing but they told them
a PC part Baker told me everything is
compatible weld it so that's good here
is my motherboard
so what is oh okay so that's where the
pins go great
that should be easy right that's an easy
thing to do
putting the core in should we do that
first let's do that first
let's put the core in you know it's the
most nerve-wracking thing sure the pins
on that are very delicate well now now
you got me extra excited don't put it in
there like like a like turn the wrong
way and then pull like a clamp to try
and get it and like you're gonna like
rip all of the pins out of the processor
and then you're gonna ruin both your
processor and your motherboard thank you
right while you watch a little video and
it says like what was cut processor you
know lines up here like this when you
put a lever you can expect it to feel
like this much pressure but if you feel
too much pressure stop immediately
Phillip feels like that you're gonna
break something and you have no idea
what to expect now and until that's
frightening
is frightening I'm a winged it kind of
guy rich
I'm a winged it kind of guy so here is
the processor this beautiful view what
is the name of the motherboard for these
for these nice people who are watching
oh sure good so this is an MSI be 150 I
gaming pro AC there's a lot of
motherboards out there yeah
oh yeah I know a lot of motherboards out
there because my dad's very into
computing uh he gave me a piece of
advice years ago that I took to heart
okay
don't neglect your motherboard don't
like buy the cheapest thing you can
because you think it's at least support
its it ties everything together it ties
everything don't get a cheap motherboard
ya know so the you know I and I went
with reviews not just like the big the
biggest like the most positive reviews
but the most amount of reviews right
because that's usually what you do it
like like so if it has a good number but
also like 500 reviews okay works for a
life just made it was cheap but yeah
well but if it has good
you okay okay but you know what we're
it's like if there's one that's like a
five-star but only has ten reviews and
one is a four and a half star and has
500 reviews I'm more apt to get the 500
review on the CPU is key to go in one
direction only make sure to match up the
indicator down with the in with the top
of the CPU on that with a second so it's
the msi be 150 i gaming pro ac good
stuff on it you know I thought it would
hilarious it has one of these old-school
mouse and keyboard inputs like anyone
would ever need those but good Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is important to me as my office is
not wired right now for Ethernet so I
need a good Wi-Fi and what is this thing
why is that there none of us is
regarding the is this replacing Mima and
best of the worst
oh sure you can laugh Erol and patrons
should be worried I can consider blinken
a my a game station gone quick cuts gone
I'm also gone fuck BOTS 48 hour film
rich Evans watches animated blinkin 101
kid jokes
dude bros care bores keep making the
same old stuff because I don't like
things that are different
mmm interesting do you have any thoughts
on that rich well for one I think it
isn't m.i.a
right I can tell you that blanket is
being worked on as we speak
everyone knows blankets being worked I
have recently been working on a thing
before blanket you have in fact you have
been doing game stations been dead for
years and has been dead because it
sucked and we replaced game station with
something thank you that's why we're all
here dude Bros has been dead for like
like a decade before rlm was a thing I
was n with care boards by the way there
was one care Bors there was one care
Bors and dude bros was the thing before
RL m yeah
people are just butthurt because i
called them out on there
their comment section bullshit right I
think okay I lift it up this thing and
then this thing raises up this is where
I'm gonna start to get real nervous all
right what I'm reading I'm reading the
instructions right now okay what what
processor did you get oh my gosh that is
doubly important I got the Intel Core i5
6600 K so Intel Inside Intel Inside a
core i5 you know you can't go with the
i7 which is significantly more expensive
so I got this Black Friday Black Friday
yeah
rich is a deal hunter I am an impatient
man but the six is six hundred again
good reviews that's okay oh I was
reading the instructions my five is fine
of course it is it's everything I got is
gonna be fine
that is a real heart rate monitor yeah
that is a real heart rate monitor people
right now is that his riches idea here
is the heart rate monitor that is
currently hooked up to my toe I am not
joking that we got an actual pulse
oximeter there was you know and so that
is it live right now and I am being cool
I'm staying cool because I'm trying not
to freak out because once you start
freaking out there's no stopping
freaking out you you read the
instructions yeah and make sure damn
well you make big damn sure you know I
don't put that on I'm walking I'm just
glad you didn't try to put like thermal
paste all over the socket oh god I'd
like to think I know better than that
okay let's see here
renegade curious rich what are your
thoughts on dead rising for removing the
timeline the time limit mechanic not
even having an optional arcade mode it
bummed me out and I'll just stick with
Dead Rising 2 off the record yeah it
kind of ruins the game I am now not
interested in Dead Rising for a little
bit a little bit injured like like like
I'm sale
I'll check it out someday but what do
they do it kind of that you know how
dead rising has like the strict time
limits like everything in that game is
on a clock yeah you have three days and
X happens on day two and you have so
much time to do it but you gotta balance
that with doing this one all that's
going oh so much times you wanna take
the time and fuck off be casual it's
more fun now cuz it's boring
it's more fun now cuz it's boring that
sounds about right telegin says great
best of the worst guys I don't know how
you turned the conversation around to
male pregnancy and armpit Davis
but somehow you did that's that's the
magic of rich Evans right there Mike sue
might get a lot to do with that I was
proud of my use kit tampon edition
though to the story as who should be
right something logical you needed a
hang if you're gonna have a baby just
there's two things you need for sure
unless you're cloning okay
right I did that then I just then I just
put this thing back on like there's no
pushing or is everything wanna dump and
in the right spot yeah it has little
tabs okay
it has tiny little tabs and then this
just kind of oh so the yeah this is the
tough part right here is now you push
down on this to close it all
show them what you're doing okay so I
lined up the core and here I'll open
this back up again you do have the
plastic off right oh yeah I totally did
that one there's plastic I didn't see
plastic yeah this is what it came okay
yeah that's right okay there's plastic
how they package it I well now you got
me freaked out
you should be freaked out I this is
where the most expensive rotten things
can happen okay so I know it's lined up
because it has if you can you can see it
has little tabs right here that make it
line up so now I'm just gonna push down
and hope that everything's fine so that
goes on top there boom
and yeah this is the
so that should be it boom now I got the
processor right sure why not I don't
care
you put thermal paste on before you put
the cooler on depending on what goes on
top of the processor I'm talking to the
chat okay
don't yeah don't don't bend pins in
three two one no no it's fine
the I did you I hopefully all heard like
the groan that that Gaelic yeah but I
think I can see Jax shuffling his feet
around from the PPG maybe yeah and well
that's I'm trying I'm trying not to move
it too much but okay great so there's
the processor that's in that's all
that's everything you don't even know
how to properly apply the throw paste I
don't you know you know I rich you're
here and you've done this before
the whole bit was I don't help you I
thought that was the bit we had a bit
that's the exciting like rich isn't
gonna catch but like a PC and rich isn't
gonna help
I got a tune in for that drama no it's
not drama
that was never part of that I was never
part of the plan that was never part of
the plan this is gonna be like us
playing XCOM it's gonna be like you
playing ex-con with me now put the thing
in there now put it on like that
you're gonna armchair general right he's
planning on asking the chat LS it using
too much thermal paste did you buy
thermal paste i came with the cooler oh
okay I brought something I thought
sometimes racism I was ready for a
gotcha yeah yeah I mean the one thing
the one thing I thought about is like I
got this SSD and I don't know if this
came with the cord it should come with a
cord right do you think yeah right I
don't know either that's always part of
the plan Jack some coolers come with
pace to already apply yeah some coolers
come you're now dead again I'm dead
again now your big toe I'd only go likes
your tiny toe oh it's not on my
don't we won't fit on my big door won't
fit on your big don't think I just know
you're dead
am i dead again no they're gone I'm back
I'm back alive I just needed to move my
foot there we go I'm back alive again
everybody you know you might want to see
a doctor about that
what that's some kind of poor
circulation going on Jack I don't know I
might have forced circulation I don't
know that's why do why do you think it's
so important that I stand up every else
he's acting before you lose that foot
I'm saying diabetes is important okay so
do I so what do I do
you know I have all these cables here
you have um processor in I have the
processor in you might want to put it in
the case put it put this in the case
yeah you put this in the case before you
put the the cooler out oh well I don't
know how fancy your cooler is I put my
cool around after the fact okay
I don't think I did know I didn't that
would be that might be dumb that might
be in your cooler okay let's take a look
at my cool thing I think I'm being brain
dead cuz it's been it's now been a
couple years since I have done this
right right I hope you have SATA cables
somewhere because I don't have spares of
those for the for my hard drive to the
motherboard come with like cables for
head drives and for other things some
cables it came with some cables and are
you even doing a CD drive no no I am NOT
doing a CD drive
hey Karen's in the chat maybe I can put
it in an earlobe okay here's my cooler
it took me a long time to find the right
cooler Kurtis suggested you put the
heart rate monitor on you hear that my
earlobe yeah and you know I just don't
think I just have to move my foot
everyone tomorrow think of the visual
think of the visual Jack I can't
concentrate I'm putting my computer
together if I got a thing in my earlobe
rich okay check out this beast foam you
don't know did you end up going water
cool like what that is gigantic what is
this
I didn't know water cool I wanted to go
water cold which is insane no that's
crazy it's perfectly fine and in my case
here I'll show it before I show you the
cooler that I got my case has these two
holes right here if you can see two butt
holes
come here they're real these two
potholes right here for specifically for
water cooling so you can put a water
cooler in here run the tubes out here
the only problem is then the radiator
this case is designed for the radiator
to sit on top and so then you got a
little brick on top and that would kind
of ruin the streamlined look that I'm
going for the the aesthetics that I'm
looking for so I found but but also you
know the case is not very wide and so
you can't have I can't have a cooler
like Richard had so I found one that did
things a little bit different it's still
a heat sink not some funky colors in the
fin it's still a heat sink cooler but
the fan is on the other side we're gonna
happen and that's great if you might
want to put your motherboard in I don't
know how that's gonna fit on the board
you might want to you might not have
room to put all the screws in I'm not
sure how that's of what you're gonna
have to screw them on the motherboard
into the case it's something yeah yeah
yeah yeah is that gonna cover screw
holes something is gigantis thing yeah
would might i because it's very it looks
like it's gonna be very close to the
board right it's also very very large
mostly because rich-rich got me really
freaked out about overheating and so I
got one with the tiny case it's worried
it
to worry you got me freaked out you got
more freaked out I hope your video card
and everything's gonna fit in there with
it yes maybe
according to PC part picker everything
fits okay is all I'm saying
okay that's all I'm saying and if it
doesn't then you guys get to watch me
fail and so it's a win-win right that's
a win-win situation check should over
Clark now that he has an airplane
radiator it is alright let's you know
what let's just put the motherboard in
and we'll go from there how about why
don't ya don't screw it in just put them
on the core in and then hover the fan
over it and see if you can get it
everything you need to get at the
motherboard comes with thumb screws
which is very very area or the case
comes with thumb screws for the
motherboard so that's very nice future
famous person says you just you just
read things and look at what you're
doing for a bit yeah
future famous person says rich would you
consider doing a review as Don Wilson no
because Don Wilson goes off on weird
tangents and I wouldn't be able to focus
it would be wrong if he were trying to
focus in which it wouldn't be the same
he I think Don Wilson needs to be
stream-of-consciousness absolutely yep
Judy cricket prick bastard says wow
that's it did you did you get the tips I
sent in before the stream or are my
words forever lost
I did not see another tip from Jiminy
Cricket bastard I scroll down a bit
earlier yeah I did not see any earlier
from you nay Jiminy Cricket so I think
they're lost forever Rick but we usually
do get tips that come in when we're not
streaming so I don't know what's going
on but they're definitely not showing up
here gobbledygook says Jack yeah
does your motherboard have a m2
interface if you get an m2 SSD the copy
speed is 10 times faster than a regular
SATA 3 I don't know that's a good
question I don't know is my answer how
about that okay the blue button says
dear God
make sure he takes the place
took film off the top of the processor
this is a rollercoaster ride to watch
there is no plastic film on top of the
processor I didn't really notice one I
didn't get in too close I could be wrong
first of all so it might be on there
well we'll find out
we'll find out there is no plastic film
on top of the processor all 100 series
motherboards have them says TCL p99 it
oh there you go
great that's great for me that's great
for me I'm trying to get these electric
skeleton this is rich and Jake hi I love
you guys
have some money Hey Oh Jack yeah the i/o
shield know what there should be a thing
that covers up all those ports so it
looks better in back and dust and
whatnot is the harder time getting any
is there's a thing there should be a
thing what oh oh yeah the the thing in
back here yeah yeah oh yeah we're just
remember we're doing it now make sure
things line up yeah yeah are you doing
that vertically what are you doing that
vertically what I mean why the case tone
oh my god I mean I was doing it
vertically yes
you know why rich cuz I'm a dummy
sometimes I'm a big dumb dummy well the
coaster ride is because I'm nervous okay
it's because I'm nervous I'm building a
computer which where does the internet
go where do I put the internet in
