[A] do I sound decently now I've changed
what mic I'm using someone recommend
Leonard Cohen albums I'm not an album
guy I don't think in terms of albums I
can name me a few Leonard Cohen songs
that are fucking awesome Leonard Cohen
did the future which was featured in
Natural Born Killers the future is great
he did everybody knows which I fuckin
love and Karen's really fond of oh yeah
I think of that leo yeah yeah I think
all right so um here's what's going on
today part of the reason I played a song
first supposed to give you know people
time to file in before I before I really
get into it Jack wanted to possibly talk
about the new deus ex game that came out
and I figured if we're gonna talk about
the the new game that comes out and I
don't even have one percent sure we're
gonna do that still but figured if we're
gonna do that I should be familiar with
the last one with the human revolution
the prequel it's not really a I guess
it's technically a prequel because it's
a prequel to the original Deus Ex and I
guess it would also be a prequel to the
one that just came out all right it's a
prequel yes Karen knows about planet
coaster so I have not played this game
before I actually played a little bit
less than I played a couple hours before
I had a thought you know if I'm just
gonna try and and play my way through
this game I may as well stream it I mean
why the heck not let me let me get my
number pad set up here which I should
have plugged in earlier but I didn't
think - it's fine everything's fine
all right and fair warning because I
kind of want to play this game for
myself is gonna be pretty quiet rich
stream maybe even quiet relative to
other rich Evan streams but I thought me
playing through it I don't know how much
I'm gonna get through I don't know how
long the game is but I thought me
playing through human Revolution for the
first time people would want to see that
so uh here we are here we are kill or
knockout I'm not entirely sure I played
through the first section and it doesn't
seem like you have a choice I couldn't
oh god sorry I got got some got some gas
here oh I want to built right into the
mic that would be horrible but I tried
to go kill us in the first section and
it didn't seem to want to let me now I
did not play the original original so
I'm just gonna do a new game here medium
difficulty I'm probably I'm probably
never going to play a vampire the
masquerade I'm sorry
let me know if the TV is picking up in
my mic Jack knows I'm streaming I don't
know if he's gonna be free later he
might he may stop by he's under no
obligation to
you're not hearing the game at all all
right after the cutscene I will look
into that
I read the fucking chat
Lord Lord Saavik I read the damn chat
it's quite a stream because I don't talk
much during rich heaven solo streams
Karen's settling in great
yes we still plan to stream tomorrow
night this is not not a replacement
this is a last-minute rich thing
yes this is my no skipping cutscenes OCD
alright try turning it up in here turn
it way the fuck up
and you let me know if it's deafening
can you hear it now is there game audio
I think that's fairly important
all right why why is that not working is
it a number one thing oh it's the number
lock thing thank God I thought I was
gonna have to rebind everything all
right
apparently oh wait I just switched that
bind all right I played it long enough
to try and find key vines that will work
for me am i weird
what did you mean back there Meg about
how you found it
nothing it's just there's something I
should know about this place about Sarah
Megan we're still getting biochemical
fluctuations across the artificial flow
cell okay but the increased neural
peptides coming from the P dot cluster
could be throwing off your calibrations
right I double-check that
I can't believe you were asking about
David you've been here long enough to
know what Eric he wouldn't be her town
has zero pokey stops I thought there are
all over the fucking place the one one
time I played Pokemon go on the stream
with Jack it seemed like there was crap
all over it seemed like he couldn't walk
two feet without running into crap you
overthink everything Adam the work we're
doing is good we're helping people
overcome their fear main character Adam
Jensen he's kind of quiet he's kind of
generic hard-ass
ah dr. Reid this is general O'Neill dr.
Savchenko was telling me you've made
progress on the typhoon yes thanks to
Vasily actually as I was saying sir
the typhoon uses a modified combat
chassis like the one I'm wearing but
I've improved its design using shaped
micro charges to propel the steel balls
and the back glass problem solved
through kinetic bleeders in the oven
here Watch go ahead
I'm afraid I have to run but Vassili has
all the details general you're right
you're missing the point
Space Ghost is annexed but neural
augmentations that mean we got faster
react in the future you can really when
they get feeble augmentation its yeah
David talked about it for years
yeah here's a talker I'm space cyber
camp
admitted a part of you likes him no I
like everyone don't you read yeah right
I'm an ex-cop from space now I'm a
corporate cop up are you going look at
my robot eyes I forgot to leave her keys
so she will not yet they will be rolling
eyes I need to get punched in the face
first destroy that bears yet but I get
robot eyes
me too about a lot of things
there's something I
well good evening you're gonna say
something right
why'd you stop so I know just walk to
the elevator but so what
you can tell me you what hats on what
you don't know great now it's a sausage
fest and here's that firewall yet you
don't fix an entire firewall you find a
loophole and then did you plug it yes I
did oh wait I'm not gonna do the space
cowboys the whole damn story on you
mostly because I haven't played this
game you a trapeze and I want to
actually you know like experience the
game I played through this section
before she wants me to show her this
maze can haven't located her prices says
that's in character
this is the newest and encrypted GPL
trackers
sure what it takes I want you Darrow in
Washington why my side that doesn't jump
for anyone
senators love this guy Lyle the hearings
will go much
big day for us tomorrow everything in
place you sir
Capitol Police boss quarters to the hill
and then federal protection services
takes over good good
how's that girl holdin up she's nervous
oh she has to do is show more research
she explained it to you now really into
the whole science thing boss it's
incredible
all those purists out there accusing us
of tampering with the natural order when
all Megan's done is figure out how to
unlock the potential that exists within
our own DNA you know for five one irony
were there any come on Darrow ever did
environmental malfunction laboratories
subsection 6 all lab Chiefs please
report in we better not take any chances
not tonight these may all have better to
get down there I'm assuming this came
out last gen I don't even remember when
this came out it's kind of amazed at how
relatively bad another that looks
terrible but how relatively bad this
looks
I think this games a little bit older
than I thought maybe just a little bit
all right I'm gonna try cranking up
people said the game audio was a little
bit quiet I've got cranked up now I
cranked up all the way see you let me
know you let me know if this is too bad
too loud
Prichard where's Megan super Borden yet
her GPL implant shows her moving through
the microderm labs I think she's running
damn
what's the matter serious equipment
failure can you get eyes on her
Richard Richard
oh no it's fire
I don't know how to do this for section
no-kill there's no takedown option
do you just want to sneak past them
you even get anything in this game for
non-lethal or just personal satisfaction
all right just run past look this were
an actual situation just running past
those guys would be kind of dumb I think
I think this is a situation where lethal
force is perfectly acceptable
a little bit disappointed himself
honestly
we beat them up this our fists even an
option
nothing has told me that I can fist them
assuming I can't kill her but you know
fuck
well Ted
did I accidentally win
don't you say one I'm fine with that but
I don't mind stealthy snow that's fine
I think the gas the gas killed brother
and I didn't even mean to hit that gas
canister I think I just shot it lying
when I was blind just an accident but
you know what I'm fine with that
I might intend to play this is a mix of
stone and guns
your cc1 correct
this is intro she's the best I don't
know I feel like the Mass Effect 2 kind
of Lazarus cutscene Shepard Magdalene
I think that meets this
and that you've lost enough people today
you work at me to play this is the one
this has been on my I should really play
it simulator list better remove and then
Jack's been talking about maybe doing
something about the new Deus Ex which
it's not a guarantee that we're gonna do
anything with that but I figure if we're
gonna do that I should play through the
original and if you want to stream
against me today you know it'll probably
fine cuz I've never played this I'm
gonna be paying a lot of attention to
the game and a little bit so I know
what's going on
so I played through that part a little
bit of the first discussion forum last
night before I decided no I'm as no
stream
but I'm gonna be pretty quiet
now the second mass effect is good it
doesn't have a strong a main story
running through it lots of great
characters and some fantastic world
building in Mass Effect 2 and the the
last mission it's David of Mass Effect 2
is one of the best climaxes of anything
ever
the suicide mission is the session is
the absolution tree meet me at the
helipad I have to see Pritchard first
something's wrong with my retinal
enhancement Frank's on the second floor
in the tech lab make it quick
people's lives are at stake why is David
keeping the SWAT team
about time what happened you get stuck
in an air duct on the way over
yeah nice to see you too Francis
something's wrong with my retinal
display can you fix it if it's what I
think it is probably of course it might
right imaging processors weren't
completely in sync don't worry your
centrosome aspect is a nice any damn RPG
action game hybrid a retinal display
should be fine now it's recognition
that's born as an RPG tries to shine
this game absolutely fucking face-plants
at the action part we done here though
the characters you saw are so good you
don't know don't give a fuck I know
everything else like game was have
broken into our manufacturing plant and
taken hast a spec to actually has maybe
this time you'll actually acceptable
decently acceptable combats actually
pretty good decent not the best ever
fucking if you get a problem confront
your man once you just say it and get it
over location is great if anything I
blame myself
the mighty Pritchard blaming himself
that's gotta be a first I'm the one who
told sour if we needed a physical
security team to protect us if he'd read
my report closely enough wait a second
are you saying it was your idea to hire
me not you Jensen I wanted dynacord
sharp-edged or bell tower all the top
private security contractors were on my
list but Seraph wanted somebody in-house
and so did dr. Reed I suggested leave
Megan out of this why Jensen it's no
secret how close the two of you were and
let's face it you've just been fired
from SWAT for that Massacre in Mexican
town no one was about to hire you you
really have to stop getting your news
from those PICUs blogs Francis they only
confuse you the point is if Sarah had
listened to me we wouldn't be having
this conversation
but Megan God love her always did have
serifs ear serifs ear is gonna be
hearing a report about violence in the
workplace if you keep their self
you really feel like continuing point
taken all right
don't shoot some things
Adam how close see to the helipad almost
there good because swats about to turn
this into a PR nightmare meet me in the
chopper
I'll brief you as we go
go to my office why do I need to go to
my office now look how I'm gonna get
through the game I can't stop look at
everything didn't think we'd see you
around here for a while yet you know how
it goes Malik duty calls
don't I know it else I was in my
wingsuit halfway to the top of the
Renaissance Center when I got the 9-1-1
but you six months is a hell of a short
time to come back from the dead
maybe you sure you're ready for this
maybe I'll come back Roger then this
game sometimes it's already more arguing
with the DP DS technically just space
cop bull I've got the plant surrounded
but mr. serif wants you to go in first
you all set here because the sooner we
take off the better it will be for
everyone
I'm ready great then let's get airborne
whole point of this room that's like it
experienced this game if I'm doing space
cop talking over everything that's just
I'm not going to be able to experience
this is just bass cop though I am Space
Camp
I'm robots means can that's so
embarrassing
I told Farina to put his dad on a roof I
don't want the crowd seen you go in fine
as long as she pulls you out the minute
I'm gone so what am I looking at here
who are these guys crawl human purists
or so they say the same purists who've
been firebombing limb clinics all over
the country you buy that no I don't
think it's a coincidence they hit us
today only hours after he moved to
typhoon in for assembly line factory the
typhoon Megan's team was testing it the
day that bastard who's on point for
these guys Adam

[B] no you and Megan will once who is on
point for these guys
goes by the name of Sanders that's him
there
he's an Augmented Adam so he can't be
one of their mercs who attacked us but
he did know exactly how to get inside
our plant all right so how do you want
me to handle this when I guess I keep it
out until you've secured it as far as
rules of engagement go I'll defer to you
lethal or non-lethal
I'm not looking to start a firefight in
there just neutralize them okay but just
make sure those bastards don't wake up
and warn their friends you remember what
it's like in there a lot of tight and
closed hallways but the labs themselves
are pretty open high ceilings so do you
want something you can use from a
distance or up close give me something
with distance if I get too close I'll
take them up personally just try not to
break anything expensive the typhoon
should be in the factoring labs but
Prichard will tell you more as you go in
I've got them running comms terrific
anything else
keep your eyes open for hostages freedom
if you can but the typhoon is your
number one priority we've developed it
for the alphabet agencies and if we know
some of them intact it's still a secret
well a little bit I'm sure you'll get
the job done right totally see him doing
the voice possibly would have been a
better choice
somebody wants to mod his face cop body
wonder this game I will gladly dub in
the voice
I got a very important text I got a very
very important text that I have to
respond to immediately
Caryn's on the job hunt and and and I
think she caught I think she caught a
big one so III need to text back because
this is this is actually very important
I'm so sorry I'm doing this in the
middle of the stream but this is good
news yeah I got my priorities straight
goddamn it little lady gets the new job
but I gotta I gotta back her up
I gotta I gotta throw in my support
okay okay where were we at I asked we
were going to do not know things we're
gonna stop the fuck out of this shit in
Siena few of them coming out for a smoke
every now and again so be careful
tell me you're the guy we've been
twiddling our thumbs waiting for SI
security name is Jensen Jensen yeah I
thought I recognized you used to be on
teams talents Amstel that's fine to me
cuz I'm not I'm a staff guy well I don't
good self you're taking orders from a
CEO things change not always for the
better feel like getting in there and
doing whatever it is your boss wants you
to do cuz maybe then we can do our job
you look pretty dug in up here
what's the react team plan we got off
this point and Bravo was wing boat
standing by to breach your target we're
coordinating I'm here but until your
boss gives us the go-ahead we're just
holding our dicks realistic honey
features how much time do I have before
any shooting starts according to
protocol none according to your lawyers
yes my first time this way it's gonna be
a very low talk straight down and call
it basically before I decided to stream
this hell on these pure it kind of got
as far as talking to this guy and and
knocking the first person out how many
am I looking at down there
hard to say we've spotted three in the
courtyard maybe half a dozen inside but
that's a sketchy estimate at best since
we seem to be getting a loop playback
off you're in telecoms that shouldn't be
possible
I told Seraph to make sure Pritchard
overhauled the system well someone
inside must be tech savvy because all
we're seeing is a loop for all we know
there could be five 10 or three dozen
purpose in there they communicate any
demands yet not yet but I get the
feeling they're not that organized most
of the guys I've seen look like Street
bangers and thugs the kind of get their
jollies thrashing equipment you asked me
is the man in charge you have to worry
about
the leaders name is Sanders right what's
his story
Zig Sanders we're running background on
him now
looks like he fought two tours in the
Gulf one of them on a recycle and
military bill you mean he's augmented
Seraph told me is not it used to be
augmented says his odds made him do evil
shit so he ripped him out nice got a
whole crew of gullible street kids
listening to his crap and ready to die
for him or kill I think I've heard
enough you sure wouldn't want to make
your boss unhappy
we've got people inside any idea where I
should look for them yeah your plant
manager Josie Thorpe managed to slip a
call out before someone snatched her
cell she said the hostages are being
held in an office near the assembly labs
makes sense
the workers were setting up for a
production run so they'd have been
concentrated there you know more about
that than I would anything else I got it
from here sit tight wait for Seraph
signal like we got a choice so I am here
that's good
they mark things on this map like where
is the the assembly line offices were
where are those because I need to find
hostages how long fuck it fuck it
what could I steal I stole that whatever
that is it's mine now bitch
Jensen it's me Pritchard where are you
on a roof overlooking the plant good
your point of entry should be through
shipping and receiving should be Francis
the hell does that mean we have an
employee entrance they're heavily
guarded by purists no doubt so if you're
not a fan of the frontal assault I
suppose you could try accessing the
building's roof
yeah everything seems under control no
sign of squat no sign of anyone I did
the lethal one shit oh well so much for
non-lethal so much for non-lethal I got
them ass-backwards it's fine it's fine
could I not
is he just not oh wait
now I'll take all your shit
while my stealth has not been busted but
by my non-lethal plan here I went to
shit real quick didn't it
what's in here what's in here
you got something from your room magic
room
it's fine now whatever it was it stunk
oh oh okay still good for my for my
totally viable no kill run totally
viable I'm gonna get it so far how this
is largely just an experiment right here
how aware are these guards
alright that did not work out
not gonna be a person alright why do I
not you know why don't I got a cursor
for everything put the stupid gun is
that because it's a non-lethal gun I'm
figuring out this game by the way I
don't know what the fuck I'm doing
alright alright that was that was a lot
of experimentation
oh good I get to redo him too good
oh hey look at that though I am gonna
get I am gonna get these
okay well not my my non-lethal run is
totally viable sir climbing I think
doesn't walk were jumping shit I can't
like mantle up there
that's stupid oh then the Sabre man but
my arms still want to work man
just arms so hard you know
I move the damn box
Oh
I wonder what box related shenanigans I
can't pick you up
nope
can't unplug that
thing I can shoot why can't I pick you
up
can I climb with a box
I probably can't climb on the box but
it's worth a shot
nope can't climb with a box alright
I've not played Deus Ex before this is
all brand new to me
I can't mantle is there a fucking switch
like 90% chance this kills me right yep
all right all right
no sign of animal
somehow I got a feeling my plans of a
quick playthrough of this game not gonna
work out so well and why do you get them
all right something behind you I'll for
fuck's sake what the fuck this is the
dumbest thing I have ever seen this is
the absolute dumbest thing I've ever
seen
a searcher ooh whoa look at all this
goodies here remote detonated explosives
um guys this gonna be one of those games
where stealth means run through all the
vents Bridger I'm in nicely done Jensen
may I ask how a vent on the roof it'll
be in my report next time we discuss
security loopholes oh goody I'll be sure
to take notes the typhoon is in the
factoring labs
there's an elevator just passed the
assembly labs that will take you to it
got it
it's
Hey anyone there no just us pigeons
something running jump is not really an
option though what I wouldn't do for
some Batman vision right now must have
imagined
all right that guy it's gonna be a
problem
that's like a sneak around
can I just try it
oh you prick
Oh
easy
taking wast innocence anybody seen deer
at probably smoking a cigarette Wow
you shouldn't be wandering off like that
bad almost went badly mini-map yeah good
advice good advice I wasn't even
thinking about that mini-map this guy's
moving now I better get out of here
Jennsen
I just tried to unlock the assembly lab
door but my override codes aren't
working someone's changed the protocols
what didn't you plug them I'm on it but
until I find this particular breach and
fix it you'll have to hock the door
manually Richard out that one well I
would have opened our lockers they're
fucking people coming
how does this game work what all right I
don't know what I'm doing
yes yay
sure what up access granted
I I did it I think you did it yay
yeah calling me a pig no way
tell you the Shred what's that bomb
built off this guy will be the last skin
in here goodbyes
shut up chamber Trevor you got to calm
down help me find something come up with
all right 3d camera seems bad try going
around the other side
all right things have gone to hell that
sucks
I wish I understood this hacking game
like what's the goal
just hack all the hacks
I'll keep hacking all the hacks click
help
Mahad way
well do I have to hack all the things
where I just got there I got there and
didn't seem like I couldn't do anything
very confused died of the debt the
dashes I guess they only go one way that
makes sense
access granted what was confusing me was
the dashed line
all right this is store not hacked
enough there we go
what's he looking for proof that these
fuckers are lying to us I guess just
like Steve said hope seek knows what
he's stupid
all right it's got to be an iron sight
lack of a sights on that fucking thing
or killing me
I not familiar with this game I don't
know what the hell the zoom button is
hold on options controls keyboard
iron sight is what I'm assuming I want
alright I don't have that bound to
anything near me but freaky do I have
that's not what I want to know
that would probably be very handy
someday that would be very awkward but
it might work
and I need one menu button that I get
all the other menus
so
let's try it
all right
what's he looking for proof that these
fuckers are lying to us like it just
like Steve said hope seat knows what
he's doing alright how did that not hit
him what the fuck now I guess just takes
well
Wow
all right so the the tranq darts don't
last long all right we learned something
new every day
let's see looking for proof that these
fuckers are lying to us like it just
like see said hope seek knows what he's
doing
stairs give me anything I can get up
there
we'll see if I can get up there
