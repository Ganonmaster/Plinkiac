laughs what what what what not all right
shit what
don't anybody's in the room some people
are probably not watching those ever
house house nobody doing big as uh uh
yeah thanks pair to be pretty empty it's
not a streaming night the FARC and the
fuck is I'm here that's what the fuck oh
hello
I mean I'm playing dishonored to anyway
and I'm at the studio and my only real
plan for the night was I need to play
Dishonored 2 and Karen is likely busy
playing rollercoaster tycoon
so I can't really play this at home
right now I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do
this why not all right give me a quiet
stream because I need to play this game
I need to pay attention to what's what's
going on in the game so I am that's
gonna be mostly quiet stream you can
stick around and leave okay you know I
don't give no fucks and here we go
actually I want you to back up let's do
this tutorial my heart I'm at hard
yeah
someday
and so uh we're what's-her-face
I Garrett it's nice to have you back
yard
oh oh great not quite set up for that I
guess I could do that
what am I missing something do I have to
do that again but I made it under the
thing oh okay great I did not I did not
set my bindings with parkour in mind
I could switch my nose I'm yeah it's
fine
that's the
graphic settings like in here that's
right
full screen
pre-set slow
yeah ply those settings
won't need to do the reactive park or if
I'm sneaking that's good
but what
yeah it's more like it
no I've I've never done the space cop
voice during naughty time whatever that
means
sneaking up on Garrard something I never
thought I'd be doing
oh I guess that makes sense
that's right
oh there's a thing there's ooh how do i
zoom
click save shortcuts
she leaned sprint stray spyglass nope
that so the red thing it's annoying
how the little targeting icon is kind of
above what you're shooting at I got I
got spyglass bound to my little keep
head period key here and didn't seem to
work
where's it adding a spyglass yeah it
doesn't look like this it's just a
period but it's bound to something and
it's not zooming there's no zoom that's
not a big deal
spyglass is not working it's not zooming
I'm getting the button
it says infinite arrows but now I'm out
I guess that's the tutorial thing I hope
that's the tutorial thing I don't have a
spyglass okay
Oh
that's a nice option choked out during
combat
the smile was nice
if there's an echo it's probably the
speaker from the TV picking up on my
microphone I need to hear the game I'm
not doing anything about it I'm sorry
I'm sorry
PC no doubt yes
now this response to what am i playing
this on
can't I wear headphones catch you can't
you watch another goddamn stream this is
fucking bonus material
imma do it I'm okay I said I was gonna
be playing this anyway I'm like amazed
well stream it at may is most R and a
lot of people wanted to see more just
hunter too so side no I didn't finish
dishonored one because Jack had a
hard-on for doing a review on this and
he wasn't wrong because this is brand
new
I'm not really worried about spoilers I
I played two missions of Dishonored one
I can already tell you how it ends stop
the plague either provide me the elixir
cheaply or freely or a permanent cure
that they're holding back on because
people in charge of profiting off of it
save the girl killed the bad guys
slightly darker ending if you killed
more people I get it I get it
I knew how I knew how Dishonored was
gonna end after to the tutorial and
still rather play them an order but oh
well
I'm so proud of my sister yes
the screws gone on far more easily than
it should have my people be like yeah
you're gonna yep the Brutes think of the
system wouldn't anyone who can just
claim they're the Empress's lost sister
I don't think that would be so easy yeah
playing as Garrett
Corvo my ass we all know he's really
Garrett
what video cars is um so 960 or 980
inand video or 970 or the 980 I forgot
which I I forgot which I don't think I
got the top of the line at the time I'm
probably God don't like minute yeah it's
decent video card is the same video card
from when I built the PC on stream that
this is running on right now
and they say say this is much more juice
here
why don't we God
yeah read this shit later this is get
saved if you click on it yeah it's fine
set alarm
these investors aquarium sensitivities
are cirrhosis
so anywhere to hide if I set that alarm
assuming I can't just open this door
yeah he needed so I was not paying any
attention when Jack was playing
I swear I finally took this back
well I could that might not get there it
I guess it doesn't
miss I was trying some kind of plan
all right
we're skinny and I guess I just find the
key right no maybe I gotta feel dumb
oh I guess it's one way
Oh
you've got our maybe a single room there
was a
I'm sorry I can't hear you goodbye
meet my friends they say
I should have peeked that's actually
dumb quite dumb
if I jump let McDonagh noise
and go for a kill
never said it was doing a no-kill run
live it words in my mouth
are you doing non-lethal take them hey I
want a gun for now lethal if I knew
Ron you schmuck
well fuck
ring-ring
they actually run from you that's kind
of neat
shit
well I didn't kill him give me those
pairs
don't hurt a seasoned
okay
all right but did things I might never
go
why isn't who entertaining who I'm not
I'm not entertaining anybody
doing a relatively quiet playthrough of
this game that's all I'm doing
the steam notification front of a thing
I got a click yeah there's the steam
notification a part of thing I took like
I think God so much stuff to read
ain't got no time for none of it what
this toilet
I probably can't make that jump
murderer of
necessitous you've done this before
Corvo and in Garrett Corvette Corvette
I think GERD Corvo I'm gonna call them
Corvette it's funnier than Garrow what
oh shit I got a hiding spot here
anywhere
No
fuck
does he not have a way up here oh I'm
safe
if to put away your weapon well on that
F for me it's five but how much noise
does he make landing I guess I'll find
out oh not much
shit what that mean to shoot
that knockout punch is gonna be a little
bit overpowered in it
it's how did we get over there
no because I can't get up there
fuck
not doing brain
they're behind it
what that good for me not going so well
yes Steen get your get your
notifications off the fucking continue
button steam Jesus Christ not helpful
I'm sure
well fuck that
alright this is not working offer rate
due to his man
No how do I do that attack and and knock
out jump fall and knock out I tried to
do that just now and it didn't work I
must have hit a wrong button or I must
have fucked something up I'd very much
like to learn that right now I'm going
to redo the section until I learn how to
do that
well the attack button is the the stab
stab each tab which I'm trying not to do
alright that worked I got it I got the
hang
fuck's sake
hey wrong button
nope
part of this is getting used to the game
instead of choking them out when i
stunned them i I wanted this stealth you
hold the choke button you automatically
put him on your shoulder oh cool I like
it so far
I tried just holding down the block
button while that fall some curious
doesn't work and that did not work that
was an experiment that was not a fuckup
that was an experiment
I'd never made any I never made any
claims to a no death run this is a get
to know the game run this is a learn
learn what I'm doing run
ship is coming here early
the little room is not a good place to
be
so their patrols somewhat random
what happened what happened two guards
don't usually look up what happened to
that
they've taught me patience right now
this is feeling feeling my way around
goddamnit
all right can we just avoid these guys
probably take damage if I fall there
fuck it
okay okay that's it because I I have
gone into offline mode with steam it
should be fine all right so you're able
to play planet coaster okay okay
are you enjoying are you enjoying planet
coaster very much
oh you're watching the tutorial videos
for it okay okay well you you you enjoy
that I love you too alright bye bye
okay everyone I think I think we've come
to an agreement
I had to kick her off long enough to log
in so I could tell steam to start up an
offline mode
all right I probably law actually got
past that section but I turned the game
off once I realized we froze planet
coaster stream probably Sunday probably
Sunday all right there we go
all right here's the question Joey to
actually try and Stoldt this or do I do
this the fast way
oh I guess they just saw that there's
something there's something to be said
for the combat in this all right here we
go
hunk of actual stealth i'll give actual
stealth for one more chance
Oh enemies don't tend to look up except
they always do and we don't tend to look
up enemies don't tend to look up enemies
don't tend to look up enemies don't tend
to look up enemies look directly up into
the air and see you
so don't the thing they said the
tutorial ignore that it's bullshit it's
bullshit it's all bullshit all right
wait until they give up searching oh my
god you know what I'm not patient enough
for that
yo
this time we're not frozen I did this as
the game was freezing or as the stream
was freezing I was playing the game just
fine
any chance we'll play Sierra games again
in the future yes sure I want to avoid
the fucking point and clicks though
detection 26:26
it's fine
the no magic intrigues me but for
expedience sake
oh I
like how do I set things to the stand
wheel how do I change this stuff up
nope
key I want to bound do like okay okay
that's creepy
maybe
my playing is Corvo because patriarchy
well for one I don't have gender
dysphoria for other thing he's voiced by
Steven ruff Russell is he's they've gone
one step further with the whole thief
aping or homage
that rooms can be used to acquire
supernatural powers open the journal and
go to the powers tab to exchange runes
her powers
dawn shams provide minor supernatural
benefits locate them by listening for
the song they admit or use the heart to
detect them from further away by default
you can activate up to five bone charms
at once in the bone charm scent section
of yonder journal
all right
all right
why did all this get reset those are the
places I want those things and I want
them to stay there
hours right
my teapot confidence
he wanted to know if our alum was
interested in expanding its bass we
don't do fishing
turn up the game audio I thought it was
horribly echoey
when you
era
at this point you know I'm gonna do a
little experiment I'm gonna mute the TV
and you tell me if there's still an echo
all right where's my cursor there am is
there still an echo
things are falling apart in the clan God
is working up strange there's no echo
Plan B
where's Micah my hello
how does that work
I get infinite darts Wow anything
anything well I guess somebody needs to
be talking
ready for me to drop you at the docks
ready the old city must have changed a
lot off we go then one more time old
friend
get the ruin I didn't know about no room
I'm sorry I turned off a mic we weren't
using that seems to have done the trick
Corvo doesn't have a voice no he has the
voice no goddamnit and it's great
The Dukes given the Grand Garden run of
the city strangers get attacked on sight
I can take care of myself
breach atomizer take out the crown
killer and find out where Sokolov was
taken The Alchemist
Hypatia she can't I gotta I gotta tell
him even even if it weren't the the
voice of Garret from thief voicing Corvo
here I would still prefer a voiced
protagonist you're trying to do anything
vaguely narrative nothing takes me out
of it faster than a silent protagonist
you're not saying anything that people
keep talking to you it's the weirdest
thing I don't like it yeah well I'm
going to Kern now
somebody's packing weather yeah hurry up
all right get out of my way you fuckface
all right
