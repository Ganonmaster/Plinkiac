but you know if it's her great and we
get to see her negative I mean but who
cares there's so many naked women online
does it matter if it's Jennifer Lawrence
there's naked women doing all sorts of
terrible things for your enjoyment let
just let Jennifer Lawrence act
who cares if she's naked this is all I'm
saying
go go watch some high-class pornography
and enjoy the ladies doing despicable
things for your pleasure
just let Jennifer Lawrence be in her
movies okay she was in the hungry games
dick the birthday haha let that's what
I'm saying let her be hungry in the
games that's right John Kayla who cares
if you're naked too just go be naked to
the world if that's your thing
thank you triple o King for dancing for
me
[Music]
I'm not saying sex is despicable I'm
saying there are people who do it far
better and more often than Jennifer
Lawrence
they're called pornography stars
[Music]
biscuits running up and down the stairs
it's kind of weird
[Music]

glad that you're naked right now
enjoy your nakedness enjoy it
yeah I did I don't know if I have it in
me for these last two levels I'll save
these last two levels I'm you know I'm
sure Jennifer Lawrence is nice to look
at but you know
that's fine just nipple artists Arabo
event I'm not I mean she might be
actually looks a little lean I like
she'd be awkward oh pardon one day short
yeah okay I'm gonna save these last two
for the final run and then I will have
the entirety of Sheldon line on the
stream I'm late it's late and I have an
episode of pre-marked at it tomorrow so
that is gonna be it ask questions while
we're still here
rich isn't a Jan I'm gonna Chad I'm
gonna talk at you rich is here to answer
your questions in chat form
and ask away before
[Music]
we go away which is gonna happen soon
[Music]
yes let us stop the strange talk of
things
[Music]
not that into her doesn't matter
how does this game compared to Zelda it
was a very different game than Zelda
dick the birthday boy Dragon's crown is
free for Vita on PS Plus you should get
it no I got it and I was really bored
with it Oh Dragon's crown is free for
PlayStation Plus members so I downloaded
it and played it and within the first 15
minutes you get what the entire game is
gonna be about I was incredibly bored
with Dragon's crown which is a shame
because it has a super fantastic art
style and nothing else the combat system
is incredibly repetitive the battles are
tedious the art style is great but I
found the game to be such a horrible
bore I am sorry dick the birthday boy if
you enjoy it that's great dunces kind i
I was so bored with it I got I want to
say I got five hours into the game and I
couldn't I couldn't bear to turn it on
it's just I was so bored with it yeah
take the birthday boy because I don't
like dragons crown
it's unsubscribed from the twitch scream
and canceling his patron well that's
fine
I do like dynasty whores you know what
because dynasty warriors at least the
combat felt satisfying and in Dragon's
crown I don't know it's just all I know
it seems weird to say that it's so
repetitive as compared with dynasty war
but it just wants
[Music]
not
my romário I agree let's get rich into
Canada so you can see a real doctor
I haven't played any of the modern
Ghostbuster games
[Music]
Oh Richard you liked it okay that's good
[Music]
[Music]
yeah it's you know
that's the thing Dragon's crown is
golden axe on steroids it's golden axe
with a really great art style but golden
axe wasn't it wasn't that creative game
it was very repetitive and you know back
in the day it's all it's all we had
[Music]
and
[Music]
oh I want to go to Tim Hortons let's get
up to Canada soon so if you go to Tim
Hortons that's a great place get some
poutine
[Music]
when are you gonna play board games on
camera soon we are going to play board
games on camera one of these not soon
one of these days I figured out how to
at least get oh no we did we figured it
out the other day Jay has an HDMI
switcher so we could hook out multiple
cameras and use the HDMI switcher to
feed the cameras into my capture device
which would then feed into the stream so
it is very doable they don't have it one
of these days it will happen one of
these is me to rich I we get we get
tweets all the times over at the prereq
twitter is saying that people bought FTL
or bought XCOM because of our live
streams that are loving it and I ate and
high-enriched super appreciate that rich
and I super appreciate that these are
great games I could play if it were up
to me I would play nothing but FTL and
Super Meat Boy every single stream just
because those are games that I love
obviously and I try to bear it up for
you guys but get FTL X come Brits really
enjoys it I'm sure I'll get into one of
these is
the Star Trek VCR game yes absolutely
will happen good for you Lucas farts I'm
glad that FTL is now in your top 5 FTL
FTL has given me some of the most
intense moments in recent gaming memory
and that's and we're talking about a
game that you readily pause and it's
essentially a turn-based combat game I
get so worked up when I play FTL I love
it I love it I love it alright but
that's gonna be it for me again thank
you guys for coming out I think I'm
gonna give super time force another
chance when I haven't been drinking but
thanks for coming out rich is good
trivia chat for a little bit and yes I
need to finish my Ironman run of ex-cop
but Allah
