All right.
Are we live?
Is everything back?
Words, words are being heard.
What did I do?
What did my computer do?
My computer started freaking out.
Uh, I'm kind of an-, annoyed, actually.
It seems, like, the, uh, USB 3.0 ports on the back of my ports just decided they don't wanna work.
I move my computer around a lot.
I'm assuming the connections just got loose inside there.
I'm not gonna fix that now, but, I think, I think I just need to...
Hold on.
I think I just need to open 'er up and re-secure everything.
But I'll, I'll do that later.
For now, I'm just using a different set of ports.
And I'm going back to the game.
Yeah, you can, you can mock my, my craftsmanship if you want, but, uh, PC, desktop PC's weren't meant to be moved two or three times a week.
All right.
Otis, if you call again, and I'm almost in the grocery store, I'm going to beat you.
All right, also, I apologize, after my computer went down, I had LeftoverBeefcake's program running that stores who subscribed, and, uh, lost the names of everybody who subscribed during, um, the stream.
And I'm, I'm horribly sorry.
But you people, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
However number of months you've been subscribed.
PlasmaWave, TabooriHK...
Who else, who else?
Who else?
Thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
Therobroy, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
Ehh, fuck.
That could've gotten bad.
Ooh, what skill did I get?
Oh, I don't need food.
I leveled up.
Nice.
Oh, Judo Throw.
That one sucks.
I, I can never pull off, as much as I play this game, I can, I can never get the hang of that Judo Throw.
Downward, repeatedly.
I'll try again.
It never seems to work.
Guitar's a fun weapon.
I know it's not hooked up to a speaker.
It's not plugged into anything.
But I love, I love the subs.
It's like I'm that guy from Mad Max, which you should all go see immediately.
They make a good movie for a change, and it needs to make money.
Because Mad Max is fucking awesome.
I'm not gonna spoil things for anybody, but I'm gonna gush about that all night.
I'm not gonna stop.
The, someone in the chat is asking me if I have control over what gets upgraded, or if it's random.
It's semi-random.
Like, you're, you're never gonna get, like, the, the move that rips a zombie's guts out.
You're never gonna get that early, so there's, it's kinda, like, ones you're a lot more likely to get early and, and things you're not going to get until later on, but there's, it is randomized.
Like, you don't know if you're gonna get an attack upgrade, or a health upgrade, or a speed upgrade, or a new move.
You're, you're not sure what you're gonna get.
Otis, I don't have time for your bullshit.
I've got a security room to get to.
Oop, sorry, Tonya.
Tonya, I don't see you moving.
Deposit Ross.
Now move your ass.
Oh, okay.
All right.
You're right behind me.
That's a good thing.
We want you right behind me.
Run, don't walk, Tonya.
No, No!
What are you doing?
Tonya, stop crying.
It's a door.
Run to it.
Yes!
Stop killing those zombies!
We're right by the door.
I'm on the clock.
Oh, Otis.
How I hope you die horribly.
So much to do before this day is up.
I hope that didn't fuck me.
That took a lot of time, a lot of time.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Motherfuck.
Do I have time?
I'm gonna need it.
I'm gonna need it.
Okay.
They're earlier than I would like.
I'm not gonna have time for Gordon.
I'm not gonna have time.
And that's not what I wanna do.
Whatever.
I love and hate this game in equal measures.
Oh, boy.
I need to get to Gordon, quick.
Gimme my chainsaw.
Oh, there it is.
All right.
Don't wanna lose that.
All right, all right, all right.
I wanted to get Gordon, and then run into the twins, but it didn't work out that way.
I hope I have enough time to get to Gordon and back before missing out on this case.
Oh, god.
I hope I don't miss out on this case.
Oh, I meant to delete one of you.
One more inventory slow, I don't...
I can do this.
I can do this.
This can be done.
This can be done.
This is all within the realm of possibility.
I have to hit you again.
Gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
We have not lost anybody yet.
We are currently perfect.
Whoo, boy.
Just a little bit behind schedule
Not super happy.
But, in the scheme of things, not bad.
Not bad.
Uh, someone in the chat is asking, is this a no-death run, or a no-one-dies run?
It's the same.
I'm trying for both.If, if somebody dies, I'm still gona do a, a no-death run where I don't die.
But my goal is not to lose anybody.
I don't know that I'm gonna pull it off.
I've never pulled that off.
Yeah, I know, for the best ending, a couple die.
I'm not, I'm not counting that, those storyline deaths.
So, whatever.
I think, I think no matter what, you can't save everybody, in any of the, the, the other ends.
Um, I think the best you can do is 53 people rescued out of 54.
Cuz somebody survives one ending that doesn't survive the other, and whatnot.
All right.
Back into the breach.
I wanted to do...
I did remember to take a photo of the air duct.
I don't...let me make sure I remember to save it.
I did save it.
Yes.
Time is of the essence.
How much have I got for the photo challenge?
Enough.I can do it.
Day two is such a pain in the ass.
Fuck it.
Oh, I'm so close to it.
So close to leveling up.
But, whatever.
Whatever.
Yes, I am, I am solo tonight.
Mostly because I am, I'm seriously going for this no-death run, hopefully perfect run, and it would be distracting.
I'm going with Michael Rooker.
All right, all right.
Time, time, time.
Oh, shit.
I don't have my gun.
I didn't get it back from Courtney.
That was so dumb.
Fuck.
Where are you at?
Where are you at?
Time, time, time!
Where, where did he get bombs from?Obviously, he made them with his Vietnam knowledge.
Cutscene monologues are okay.
I don't think time moves when you're in cutscene.
I don't wanna miss out on the case file.
Oh, I have plenty of time for that.
What are my, I'm short on time for something...
Oh!
Kent!
Fucking Kent.Kent makes everything horrible.
I can do it.
I can do it.
And I'm opening those doors out so they don't get caught on them, because they always get caught on the fucking doors.
Take...take the weapon I'm handing you.
We'll need these.
Where's Josh?
Where is he, where is he, he's about to, he's, all right, you're here.
Come on.
I got clean sailing.
Run faster.
That's right, Rich, you hit them with that 2x4.
You, Rich, who is not affiliated with me, who is also Rich.
Nice.
All right.
Kent.
And then, other.
Actually, you guys, you guys just wait over there.
I'm not fucking around with you guys.
Oop, sorry, Kent.
All right.
Yeah, ApatheticOne, if I play this game well, it's because this is amongst my favorite games of all time.
I fucking adore Dead Rising.
So I've, I've got experience.
Oh, shit.
I've gotta feed you.
Suppose I've got nothing up here.
Cabbage in there, something fucked up?
That'll do.
Go to the waypoint.
Don't sit around like an idiot.
Who's getting eaten now, Ronald?
Haha!
Go, go, move, run!
All right.
I'm trying to...
Fuck it.
One more person to rescue before another source.
All right, do it.
If you all cooperate with me.
All right.
Whoo, boy.
What's going on over here?
Nothing?
All right.
What skill did I get?
Dammit.
How many days in are we?
We're about halfway through day two.
And also, I, I have been saving this time.
I've been saving at the beginning of new cases, mostly.
If I'm gonna have a perfect run, timing is tight.
I can't afford to run off to save constantly.
I may glitch out.
We'll see.
Yes, these guys, these, these guys here, these cultists, they can hit you with knockout gas and kidnap you.
Which, if that happens, that's gonna fuck my entire run.
These guy in, in the back of my head, I'm, I"m terrified of these guys.
Will I be getting the Mega Man stuff?
I'm probably not gonna bother.
Actually, I'm playing from a fresh profile.
I don't think I even have the, the costume unlock, so...
Yes, I know Frank is an ass, but really, that's what makes it interesting.
All right.
Oh, shit.
There we go.
All dead before they can use knockout gas.
I'm good.
Always hold hands.
Fucking wall of zombies.
I could not get through.
That's awful.
That was just awful.
Remember, Rich, if the zombie apocalypse breaks out, just hold your fiancee's hand, says Cosper.
You know what, I, I'll, I do that anyway.
Aww.
Awwwww.
I'm saying aww for you.
Just, yeah, assuming.
All right.
Stock up, always good.
Love that stock.
What are my skills looking like?
What's unlocked?
Ooh, Double Lariat.
Ooh, Roundhouse Kick, and Lift Up.
All right, those are all good things.
Getting the hang of that Judo Throw.
I am almost out of chainsaw.
All right.
I think I'm going to go make some quick before another source comes up.
I'm definitely not gonna try and rescue anybody from Wonderland Plaza right now, because that...not enough time
Not enough time.
I'm gonna cut and run there.
Activate the next story thing first.
Also, because of Ronald, I gotta remember from this point forward to always carry a food item with me because, uh, his, his little side quest thing, his little request from the office, if I don't give him food, I'm gonna lose a whole bunch of survivors.
So when I get that call, I'm gonna want food on-hand.
So there are chips in my inventory, and there they will stay.
Eh, I'm not even gonna make a quickstep.
I think I'm just gonna fool around for a bit.
Oh, shit.
They found me.
All right.
Playtime's over.
I could try and kill them now, but honestly they'll just respawn.
I, I may as well wait until after midnight.
In the meantime, I have a scythe.
Really?
Why are you in here?
I want other sources.
They have to start pretty soon.
I'm not even gonna fuck around.
Just go straight to there.
Have I gotten every Dead Rising achievement?
I think just by naturally playing it, I'm, I'm close.
But I don't, I don't go out of my way to get achievements.
I really just don't care that much about them.
The fat man only demands food once.
Well, technically twice.
He demands it before you can recruit him.
But after you get him in the security room, there's a, a special thing that pops up later where he will demand food, yes.
So it's the, the one item of food to recruit him, then one to placate him, after he's already, already, uh, been in your safe house.
Safe room?
I guess it's not really a house.
And, save.
See?
See, we are saved.
Yeah, the new, the new Wolfenstein is good?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to try the new Wolfenstein.
Fine.
Eh, shit.
Shit.
Ooh, that could be bad.
That could be bad.
I have to hope my chainsaw lasts me through Isabella.
That could be bad.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Now, now I've gotta get through one of the most difficult bosses in the game, and my magical chainsaw might break?
Oh, I could do...I got time.
I'm gonna do Above the Law first.
That'll solve that problem.
I'm not gonna risk it.
As much as I wanna get the story quest out of the way first, just to be safe, I can't risk it.
I should have kept that queen, then.
Well, you know what, I got the...we'll be fine.
Yeah, the order I wanted to do things in is gonna be slightly different, but perfect run is still doable, and...
Oh, that stupid little throw.
Work one of these days.
Any of you guys gotta queen?
Give me a queen?
Queen?
No queen zombies.
How about over here?
Nope, nope, nope, and nope.
Oh, well.
I'll do this the hard way.
We just picked up that chainsaw, too.
Eh, shit happens.
Any of you guys got a hunk of meat on you?
Haha, yeah!
Fucking awesome!
Nick, I'm sorry I don't have a shotgun to give to you.
I know, I know I can't blame you Nick.
I don't have a shotgun to give you.
Here.
It'll still suck, but it's the best I can do.
Best I can do.
Nick, where are you?
Paula Blart, mall cop?
More like Paula Blart, mall lesbian.
Mall, Paula Blart, mall lesbian rapist.
Not as fun as a movie.
Yet still more interesting.
Yeah, I, I know that chainsaw is overpowered.
That's, that's why I'm using it.
I, I feel so cheap doing it, but because I'm going for a no-death run, I, I feel like it's warranted.
First step, everybody get outta the store.
Out of the store.
All right, good.
I do not have a Knee Drop yet.
Shame.
Shame.
All right, I know you guys like getting stuck on those stairs, so now, everybody, get off the stairs.
All right, now we're off the stairs.
Now we're going down the hallway.
Follow my finger.
Just don't pull it.
Stop shooting, Nick.
Run.
Run, run to the, run to the thing.
We're going to the place.
The place where I pointed.
Too much enthusiasm.
I wish I had a better weapon to give ya.
Don't forget, forget my hand-to-hand moves.
That's what happens when you start at level one.
Ooh, I didn't mean to do that.
Get in the bathroom.
Get in the bathroom.
I think that's everybody.
I hope that's everybody.
Whoo.
Nobody better die on me.
Sally, move your butt.
Janet, stop pushing zombies.
Get into the elevator.
This game will give you some stress.
Now we play the climb-up-the-stoop game.
Did one of you fall down?
I don't care who, but someone climb up.
Oh, Jesus.
All right.
I gotta talk, take a nap.
Taking a nap.
Oh, Throw got upgraded.
Ain't that great.
All right.
Yeah, if I have one actual complaint with the game, it's that stoop, that stoop AI.
If they can fix that, I would have zero problems with the game.
I'm a go to Isabela.
All right.
What'd I get?What'd I get?
What's my goodie?
Lift Up, Knee Drop.
All right.
All right.
Suplex, eh.
Knee Drop, good.
Here we go.
How far am I?
I'd say the halfway point's fair.
I hate this fight so much.
It's, it's bullshit.
It's, basically, it's just bullshit.
Oh, stop for one second.
Ole!
Why don't I have a gun?
Because I haven't had time to grab one.
Besides, chainsaw is still quicker.
I can skip cutscenes, but I'm not going to.
It's my quirk, and I like it.
Besides, these cutscenes are, like, the only fucking break I'm getting.
All right, VeryEuphora, you think the story in this is awful?
I respectfully disagree.
I actually quite like the story of this game.
Uh, someone else, I think it was TheCobraism, thinks that Isabela doesn't look human.
You think she looks like a werewolf.
I think Isabela is one of the hottest women in all of gaming.
I'm a strange dude because I'm attracted to, uh, dark-haired women?
Let's go to the other one.
Blender.
Need a blender.
Fuck off.
For shame.
All right, now at the start of the stream, earlier on in the stream, I was talking about the, the unappreciated benefits of the large chainsaw.
I am going to show you one of them in a minute.
Eh, all right.
I got my Ronald food, that's okay.I hope to god I don't forget to feed him, though, when I came back.
That would be bad.
Yeah, Otis, I get it.I get it, Otis.
I can't tell you how long I've been playing.
I don't remember what time I started.
Yeah, we're, we're still streaming tomorrow.
This is all, this is all on me, this stream.
All right, let's go see some chainsaw magic.
Well...
All right, maybe not.
When this works, it works great.
All right.
I know this works.
Once you're chasing them, after they're running, you just keep using the...like that.
I did this once, and I didn't get shot quite so many times.
Roger...
All right, it wasn't as smooth as I wanted that to be, but it worked, dammit.
Uh, can you save Thomas?
No, you cannot save Thomas.
There is a boss you can save, though, which is fun.
Get off that stoop so I can hold your hand.
Always hold hands.
Can you ignore Thomas?
No, because then you're not gonna be able to save this guy in here.
He won't, he won't join you until the other snipers are dead.
So Thomas is just, he's fucked.
It's a shame.He's kind of a somewhat sympathetic Thomas, but, it is what it is.
Oh, no!
I didn't mean to do that to you, Jolie!
I'm sorry, I was going for the zombie!
Okay, there should be zombies up here.
Is Wayne caught on something?
You wait there.
Oh, he just hasn't joined yet.
Can I stream my stolen Grand Theft Auto some more?
Uh, yeah.
Not right now.
Actually, wait, I need you to come in, Jolie.
Come on.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Are you glitching on me?
You guys wait outside.
I don't want you guys to get stuck in this door.
I'm gonna talk to Floyd for an hour and a half until he's ready to join.
Fortunately, we're doing really good on time.
Grand Theft Auto 5, no-death?
Nope.
Uh, SpookyDooky, to answer your question: no survivors lost.
We are currently on a perfect run.
And I am going to remind myself again: don't forget to feed Ronald.
I know that's a strange thing to say, but it's, it's kind of important.
Just join, Floyd!
Fuck!
Grab a thord.
Go outside.
Wayne, I've got good news.
You're getting a battle axe.
Floyd.
Oh.
I'd like to pause for one moment while I'm right here.
I may as well do this.
I just know you idiots are gonna go down the, the up escalator.
I just, I just know it in my heart.
My heart.
Don't forget to feed Ronald.
Also, don't forget to feed Ronald.
Someone's getting grabbed up here, one second.
There was a bee.
It was a zombie.
It's gone now.
It vanished.
It despawned.
Oh, there's the bee.
I just can't reach it.
Get down...there we go.
There we go.
Almost forgot about Ronald.
Gotta keep reminding myself to feed Ronald.
Cuz that would be bad.
That would be, almost be enough to make me wanna quit.
Wayne, that's good, but don't, don't hit our allies.
Because it sucks when your allies hit you, doesn't it?
Rachel, where the fuck are you going?
And why are you going there?
What happens to Ronald if he doesn't eat?
Uh, the room he's in, every survivor in that room is going to leave with him to find food, and then they're all going to die.
Because they get eaten by zombies when they go out to find food.
Ronald is basically in the middle of starting a mutiny right now.
And the only way he'll stop mutinying is if I feed him, because he's a fucking pig.
If this game was Japanese, then I'd have to find out that Americans are fat.
Fat, lazy, and horrible.
That's the message that you're supposed to take away from this game.
Floyd, are you still back there?
Who's being grabbed?
Okay.
Feed Ronald.
Don't forget to feed Ronald.
Most important thing here is to remember to feed Ronald.
And I have my bag chips out and ready to go.
Can't forget this.
Get outta my way, get outta my way, get outta my way!
Oh, my god.
Yeah, you're right.
I might eat those chips by accident.Oh, my god.
First thing I'm doing, after this cutscene, is switching items.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Transect, you say, oh god, this game is actually about the war on terror.
No.
Actually, this game is actually about how fat Americans are.
You'll see as we get there.
But the real plot is about how fat we are in America.
I say we.
I'm assuming not everybody is from the United States of America.
All right.
Item switched out.
Get to Isabela, and I, I even got time to kill.
All right, gotta feed Ronald.
Ronald McFuckface.
Yes, he just pushed me.
I, I have him tolerate it.
I don't really have much choice.
Oh, I'm sure there are parallels between this game and the War on Terror, I'm just saying, you'll see.
It's, it's about, it's about what we eat, it's about how, how gluttonous in, in, in general, United States is.
Selfish, and, and, and selfish gluttonous.
Because this game is Japanese, and that's how they feel about us.
Americans are so fat and stupid!
Let's make a game about it.
They won't even notice.
It's been a while since I've used the katana.
Eh, we're good on health.
I'm gonna say two quicksteps is acceptable.
I'll make more later if I have to.
What am I doing?
What do I need to do?
What should I be doing?
I'm gonna go to the food court.
We're gonna kill time at the food court.
I'm gonna keep some, uh, wine, in my inventory, cuz there's another, it's, am, um, you know, it's not a side quest where you're in danger of losing people like you are with Ronald.
Cuz if I didn't feed him, everyone in that room with Ronald would have disappeared, and they'd all be dead.
Don't wanna risk getting knocked out.
You get 500, uh, siege points for everyone of those guys you kill, but I, I'm, I'm not risking getting knocked out at an inopportune time.
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna replace my chainsaw.
Yes, that's, yeah, this game thinks all Americans are either fat or mindless zombies.
Yes.
That's the central theme.
I'll just go through here.
Nice.
Wall Kick?
Eh, that sucks.
So, so situational.
Comically so.
Judo Throw does not fucking work.
All right, I'm just, uh, running around, earning some spare points while killing time.
I don't wanna kill too much time.
Nope.
Didn't want you.
I think you get something for using every blender you get.
But I'm not even close to that.
Maybe I am.
And, uh, now because I rescued Floyd, the old guy I was carrying around, I'm gonna start carrying a bottle of wine to fulfill one of his requests later on, though nowhere near as urgent.
That is the one for Ronald.
Ronald McFuckface.
All right.
Few minutes to spare.
So how's everyone doing?
Yes, I am going to kill the card guy sometime after midnight.
But it's not after midnight just yet.
Or even, even if it is, I gotta be here for Isabela.
Which is right now.
How many people were in this town again?
53 odd-thousand? Maybe 54?
There is an achievement for killing over that many zombies.
Yes, that, that achievement is how you get the Mega Buster.
I've gotten it before.
It's boring.
You basically have to drive around in the tunnels with the car for, like, six hours.
Is the Mega Buster fun?
It's, it's amusing.
It's extremely powerful.
It kills the bosses in, like, one shot.
No, I'm, I need that chainsaw.
Something else has to go.
Shoot that zombie.
There we go.
Otis, fuck off.
I'm not answering.
All right, Kindell.
Normally, you're a great survivor.
Get it in gear.
I already told you no, Otis.
Isabela, don't get in my way when I'm swinging around a chainsaw.
Probably clear this area out then.
That throw never works.
Never works.
I gotta stop trying.
Fucking dayglow worms.
Oh, shit.
I'm too early.
Fuck.
I'm thinking if I want to try and...no, I don't.
I'm gonna wait.
I'm gonna rate, wait.
It's just about time.
Person in the chat, it's, it's impossible to do a Dead Rising speedrun.
Maybe you could overtime mode a, a little more or a little less...uh, what, what just happened?
I'm, I'm wondering if I have time to rescue people before the, that Santa Cabeza mission comes up.
I'm gonna say no.
No, I think I do.
Oh, god.
Oh, god.
I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna try cuz I'm so stupid.
Why am I so stupid?
I am so stupid.
I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna try and do this.
Oh, god.
Oh, why?
Why am I dumb?
Why am I so dumb?
Yeah, the gun people.
I'm gonna try and go for the gun people.
All right, you guys need to hurry up cuz we got a long way to go to the security room.
Yeah, Alyssa, shut up.
Just to get the door.
Get to the door.
Get to the door.
Door.
Oh, I'm getting close.
All right.
It, it is a way, I think.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Time is a fire in which I wil l burn.
Why are the guys armed to the teeth always the most difficult to save?
Oh, man.
You guys better be on that stoop before time runs out.
Get up here.
Climb up.
Climb up faster.
Climb up the stoop.
I have not forgotten the wine.
Thank you for reminding me, though.
Uh, DickNeutral, it depends on what game you sent me.
Or Jack, I guess you're talking to Jack.
Jack looks like he's back.
Hi, Jack!
Uh, ConquerBeard, not only did I save Leia this time, so far I have saved everybody.
This is a Dead Rising god run.
Uh, HellCopter, the only achievement I'm going for is my own sense of achievement and satisfaction.
I am going to have a fucking Dead Rising perfect run starting from fucking scratch.
And, the money shot.
I love this game.
All right.
Back in the saddle.
Give, uh, wine to man.
Ooh, I got Neck Twist.
All right.
All right.
Convicts, theater, and then things are looking good.
Probably do theater first.
Yeah, theater first.
Saving people is paramount.
All right.
Ehh, no.
No, I want me a big gun.
Fire those motherfuckers.
Am I going the right way?
Okay.
Yeah.
I think that's the right plaza.
Oh, I should have taken the...oh, well.
It's not a big deal.
I only lost a miniscule amount of time.
Should've, should've driven the Jeep here.
Sorry if I have not been talking too much this stream.
I, I'm in it to win it, baby.
My brain, my brain is in the game.
That was...cocky, cocky, cocky.
Don't wanna lose my gun.
Ugh, fuck!
Yeah, all mixed drinks heal.
It's not just...hold on, I have to deal with some assholes.
I feel like this is a good use of my machine gun.
Talk to me, chat, while there's still time.
All right, I got my book that makes survivors more courageous, and I got two guys armed with shotguns, and a lady with a chainsaw.
Let's see what this does.
Get out of my way!
For fuck's sake.
Why am I a jerk?
And you fuckers can't get through the front door.
Shoot the zombies.
All right.
Now you're getting the hang of it.
Use those guns I gave you.
They're doing great, but I'm fucking up.
All right.
Come on.
You guys are supposed to be my ass-kicking squad.
Not a lot of good this book is.
Haven't got acoustic very much.
Not as fun.
Sorry, I thought you were a zombie.
It's still nighttime in the game?
Oh, my.
Michelle is fine.
Everyone's fine.
Chat can stop freaking out.
Everyone's fine.
We're almost there.
We're on the home stretch.
It's almost early enough for the zombies to start coming down, too, which is good.
All right, I'm gonna hold of those shotguns.
Who's missing?
Who's missing?
Beth.
Beth with my chainsaw.
Came up with five, right?
Yeah.
One of you get out of the way of the other one.
All right.
Level 40.
All right.
I'll take that.
Feels like I was more leveled, first time, the last time we did this.
At this rate, I'm gonna have everyone but two people saved before we even get to the bomb mission.
Oh, I've got Ronald already, Jack.
I, I, I was worried about it earlier, so I kept asking people to remind me.
And now I think, as a joke, they're stilll reminding me, even though that time in the game has, has come and gone.
Um, where do I wanna go?
Yeah, we'll take a shortcut.
Ronald, Ronald's been fed twice.
He wants to recruit him.
That wasn't the, the time I was paranoid about forgetting.
Because the bad one's the second time in the security room, which is the only time he asks is in the security room.
Done and taken care of.
Haha, yeah!
Wrecked him.
Fucking wrecked him.
All right, no Susan yet.
Definitely doing better than last time.
Last time I didn't really have the...gun store people saved.
All right.
While I'm thinking about it...
Therobroy, TomRamens, and SkSk, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
Six months in a row, three months in a row, and twelve months in a row.
Thank you.
All right.
That takes care of that.
Back to the game.
Back to What's Gonna Go Wrong to Ruin My Perfect Run, the stream.
Who was trying to call me?
Oh, someone probably has a request.
Oh, it's probably Kindell.
Oh, god.
That's another one you can't forget, or you're fucked.
No, Gil.
Oh, shit.
Susan.
Bad timing, Susan.
Bad timing.
Susan, what are you doing?
All right.
You stay over here by the nice man with the shotgun.
He'll keep you alive, and I'm gonna get Leroy, and then we're all, we're all gonna leave.
Oh, boy.
Gil and Susan.
This will be difficult.
Good job, granny.
Good job, granny.
All right.
Can't let Susan die.
Can't let that happen.
Come on, granny.
Come on, granny.
Let's go!
Come on.
I need to get in the bathroom, not stand in the entrance.
You need to all be in the bathroom, so we can all go over at once.
That has to happen that way.
All right, you're all in the bathroom.
Oh, boy.
Leroy, I'm gonna trust you with my, with my saw.
I know I have to get another one, anyway.
This is a, this is a joke.
This is a comedy routine.
This is why you don't want to escort two cripples.
All right, Gil.
Ah, heal and level up.
Oh, boy.
Oh, god.
Oh, she's at half health.
I thought she was lower than that.
Not that scary.
Why won't you people use your shotguns.
Fucking, Leroy!
You're giving me that chainsaw back right now.
Debbie, don't get too close.
I'm brandishing a deadly weapon.
A, a deadly, deadly weapon.
A Debbie-killer weapon.
Cuz fucking Leroy hit me with a chainsaw too many times, and now I'm low on health.
See how this works.
All right, all right.
Finally using that shotgun.
All right.
All right.
All right, that's the worst of it.
Susan, you're going the wrong way, Susan.
Fuck, I'm so close.
So close.
So amazingly close.
Oh, wow.
Holy fuckballs.
Holy fuckballs.
You guys wanna dance?
You know what...dance.
Dance.
That's fine.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, wow.
Holy fuck.
I have never done this well before.
Ooh, look at that.
Chat, you may have just saved my ass by reminding me about Kindell.
No?
No option to talk to him.
I think that's good.
I hope it's good.
All right, well, I have to kill time.
I need a new chainsaw, so, I'll get a chainsaw.
The Kindell problem is, Kindell starts a mutiny and takes away a quarter of my survivors.
At some point, he's gonna do it.
Apparently, he hasn't done it yet.
I was sure that's what Otis was trying to call me about.
But it wasn't giving me the option to talk to him, so...
Hopefully that wasn't just a glitch.
Well, I know I didn't answer the phone, but still, I, I still think that mission would, would come up even if I didn't answer the phone.
It would be...I dunno.
I dunno a lot of things.
But I did try to talk to Kindell.
It wasn't letting me.
I'm a little bit worried it's some kind of glitchy thing.
And when I get, a quarter of my survivors are gonna be gone.
I'm a lot, I'm, I'm not, actually, I'm a lot worried about that.
Cuz now, I have no idea what the call was for.
Maybe it was just for Leroy.
Cuz I don't ever remember getting a call for Leroy when I saved.
So maybe everything's good.
Maybe, hopefully.
I'm not sure entirely everything's good.
Gonna make some quickstep.
I, I have no healing items.
Yes, it's the third day.
And I actually have a lot of the pain in the ass type of stuff taken care of.
This is going too well.
It's frightening.
All right.
Off to the security room.
That's a lot of real estate.
Probably should've done a quickstep.
Better safe than sorry.
Yes, yes, chat.
This game again.
It's not like I didn't say I was going to try another no-death run on a non-normal streaming night.
All right, all right.
I have plenty of time.
But I do wanna make sure I beat Kent.
Yeah, I plan on checking Kindell again, even though I didn't get a call.
WordSavage says Kindell is still an hour away.
I'm gonna double-check anyway.
I'm, I'm so close to rescuing everybody.
I'm not gonna risk losing a quarter of them now.
All right.
All's cool with Kindell, for  now.
Gotta get there before the cutscene.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
All right.
I'm in time.
Oh, didn't mean to drink that.
Oh, well.
Did my flipkick.
Douche is dead.
You're glad the protagonist is ugly.
I am, too.
Frank is interesting.
What is it, Otis?
Kindell?
All right.
Wow.
Clear sailing.
Jack, thank you for entertaining everybody in the chat.
In chat.
I'm so, so fucking close to pulling this shit off.
What I'm, what I'm worried about is that I'm gonna get to the end and the last boss of the game is gonna kill me.
That's what I'm worried about.
Goodbye, FrostySnooze.
Yes, the final boss of the game is hard.
Also, yes, I have heard of the Dead Rising streaming only on Crackle.
And I started to watch it, and I was enjoying it, but there were so many ads.
Oh, god.
It was like watching network TV again.
Network TV.
I mean, every, every minute of, of movie was accompanied by, like, four minutes of ads.
Made me sick.
Ooh, sorry, Simone.
Trying to do something else.
Where ya at, where ya at?
Come on, come on.
I'm right here.
Definitely don't wanna make that exchange.
Don't forget Kindell.
Don't forget Kindell.
Don't forget Kindell.
Don't forget Kindell.
Don't forget Kindell.
Kindell, Kindell, Kindell.
Are you gonna read a book?
No.
That is all of the survivors.
All survivors are now saved.
And they will remain saved so long as I can get this Kindell business taken care of.
Even if I die right now, this is a damn fine run.
I have never pulled this off before.
I am very, I'm, I'm, internal, inside, I'm giddy.
I'm going for the true ending.
Even if...look, if you go for the true ending, you still get over 50 survivors after overtime.
Cuz, uh, you count.
All right.
Wooo, doggy.
Shit just got real.
I am not past the part where we crashed last time.
Why do I have Face Crusher?
My life is complete.
Oh, I should've grabbed a skateboard.
Fuck it.
By the time I go back for the skateboard, eh...it's fine, it's fine.
Do I dabble in the realm of liquor, or am I a strict beer man?
Actually, I am a teetotaler.
I have nothing against drinking or people who drink.
I just don't, myself.
Always been uncomfortable with, uh, anything that would alter my, my perceptions.
Anything that's gonna fuck with my brain.
It's ehh.
Brain barely works as it is.
I should've grabbed the skateboard.
I still have time.
Do I drink coffee?
No, but it has nothing to do with caffeine.
I just don't like coffee.
Doesn't matter how much cream and sugar you put into it.
Coffee always tastes bitter to me.
All right.
This is the, uh, home stretch here.
No, my fiancee is not also a teetotaler.
She's a, she's a social drinker.
The one time I did drink, it was because, uh, she was so curious about what I would be like drunk.
Nothing especially exciting happened.
It's not really like a story worth telling, but...
Oh, fuck.
Well, that sucks.
There was one down in here, I think?
I should not be falling down now.
Ugh, you fucking zombie!
If he blows up my bike, I'm gonna be so pissed off.
Eh, we lost a bike.
That's all right.
We'll be fine.
We'll be fine.
Lost some time.
I'm not happy about that.
Where's the next one?
Where's the fucking next one?
Yeah, I know what I gotta do.
Oh, boy.
This car is gonna give out.
This car is gonna give out.
Hell, yeah, I'm getting the extra Brad cutscene.
Yes, person using PreviouslyRecordedLive right now is Jack.
You wanna know what happened to Brad?
You'll, you'll find out in just a second.
I'm driving to his location right now.
Oh, shit.
Ugh...
Well, Xbox took another shit.
God, these things are awful.
Redo the fucking bombs is what that fucking means.
I'm not gonna count that because that's a fucking, that's a fucking technical glitch.
It has nothing to do with me failing.
Sours my run.
God, that's annoying.
Who am I logged in as?
Oh, I gotta...
God, that is so obnoxious.
I know I saved after Kindell, but I'm not taking chances.
All right.
Motherfucker.
Piece of shit system.
Piece of fucking shit is what you are.
Fuck it
Fuck it.
Just a little bit, kinda sours the, the Dead Rising run of my life.
It wasn't really a no-death run.
It kind of reloaded, I mean...
Fuck off.
Fucking piece of shit hardware.
Piece of shit, lousy, third-rate hardware.
I wouldn't have an Xbox if it weren't for this game.
It's the only reason I haven't thrown the fucking system in the trash.
PlayStation 3, I bought it early on in the PlayStation's life, and it was used.
Never failed me.
Never fucking failed me.
Xbox?
Fuck.
Fuck.
I'm, I'm, I'm the red ringmaster.I'm the ringleader.
The red ringleader.
God, that pisses me off.
This game needs a, a fucking PC release.
It just needs it.
Every other good game is available on another system.
I'll, I'll utter more words.
Right now, I'm, I'm focused on, on getting back to where I was before the fucking Xbox took a goddamn shit.
How come the Xbox gets a potty break, but I don't?
Turn...no?
Oh, there it is.
Fuck you, Carlito.
Yes, this is the quiet of cold fury.
Here.
ScribeFractions, if you're waiting for me to chant jimmy jams, I, I would not hold my breath.
That's Jack thing.
To me, the jim, whole jimmy jams business, that's just weird.
