have control over what gets upgraded or
if it's random its semi random like
you're you're never gonna get like the
the the move that rips your Dom bees
guts out you're never gonna get that
early so there's there's kind of like
ones you're a lot more likely to get
early and and things you're not going to
get until later on but there's it is
randomized like you don't know if you're
gonna get attack upgrade or help upgrade
or a speed upgrade or a new move you're
not sure what you're gonna get

lost anybody yet we are currently
perfect little bit behind Spa I'm not
super happy follow me
but I'm scheme of things not bad not bad
follow me
someone in the chat is asking is this a
no death run or a no one dies run it's
the same I'm I appreciate trying for
both if somebody dies I'm still gonna do
a a no death run where I don't die but
my goal is not to lose anybody I don't
know that I'm gonna pull that off I've
never pulled that off he's stabilized
you should be fine for me and over the
best ending a couple people died I'm not
I'm not killing them their storyline
deaths so I'm you whatever you whatever
you whatever you whatever

[B] yeah
must be from that girl I saved girl was
she hurt I offered to help her but she
took off can't really blame her for
running from a guy with your looks
anyway she was saying something about
Santa cabeza Santa cabeza I think I owe
dr. Barnaby you're awake Santa cabeza I
should have known I thought Santa cabeza
was over and done with
you plan to dispense justice now calm
down doctor Barnaby we're only following
orders we have to protect that you texts
more like imprison professor if we're
going to protect you we need to know the
truth all of it I think I think no
matter what you can't say talk to us
everybody in any of the the other
endings I think the best you can do is
53 people rescued out of 50 great
because somebody survives one ending
that doesn't survive the other and
whatnot fine I'll just get my
information somewhere else thank you
very much
maybe if I can track down that woman
again
back into the breach
yeah
I did remember to take a photo of the
air duct I don't let me make sure I
remember to save it I did say yes
it's time
I'm fed up with a photo challenge
enough I can do it
it was such a pain in the ass
Oh
fuck it
I'm superstar so close to leveling up
but whatever whatever
yes I am I am solo tonight
mostly because I am I'm seriously going
for this note depth on hopefully perfect
run and you Philip it would be
distracting I know why it's because

cutscene monologues are okay I don't
think time moves when you're in cutscene
don't want this out on the case file
all right plenty of time for that what
am i I'm sure on time for something Oh
Kent ah that makes everything horrible I
could do it I can do it
I'm opening those doors out so they
don't get caught on them because they
always get caught on the fucking doors

Oh
beginner's luck that's all what's
happened one more just one more contest
Frank be here tomorrow at noon we'll
settle this
yeah a pathetic one if I play this game
well it's because this is amongst my
favourite games of all time I fucking
adore Dead Rising so I've got experience
Oh
cabbage in there or something fucked up

go to the Waypoint sit around like an
idiot
who's gonna eat no Ronald ha ha ha don't

rescue before another source I could do
it if you all cooperate with me whoo boy
all right
yeah school like that
behold the end of the world is upon us
how many days when are we worth about
halfway through day two
to the salvation of the soul
is the purging of the cake and also I
have been saving this time I've been
saving at the beginning of new pcs
mostly I'm gonna have a run timing is
tight I can't afford to go run off to
save constantly I make much out will
sing yes these guys these guys here
these cultists they can hit you with
knockout gas and kidnap you what should
that happens that's gonna fuck my entire
run these guys and the back my head I'm
terrified of these guys well let me get
into Mega Man stuff but I'm probably not
gonna bother actually I'm playing for me
fresh profile I don't think I even have
me the costume online so yes I know
Frank is an ass but really that's what
makes it interesting
oh shit all dead before they can use
knockout gas so good
always hold hands
fucking wall of zombies I could not get
the most awful that was just awful
earn for rich if the zombie apocalypse
breaks up just hold your fiance's hands
as Casper you know what I do that anyway
I'm sent out for you yes sir
what
all right stocked up always good loved
that stock one of my skills looking like
that's a lot double-berry it
Oh roundhouse kick hand the lift up all
right those are all good things
hang that judo throw almost a chainsaw
I'm going to go make some quick step
before another source comes up I'm
definitely not going to try and rescue
anybody from wonderland Plaza right now
is that not enough time not enough time
well cut and run there activate the next
story thing first also because of Ronald
I got to remember from this night
forward to always carry a food item with
me because his his little side quest
thing his little request from the office
if I don't give him food I'm gonna lose
a whole bunch of survivors so when I get
that call I'm gonna want food on him so
there are chips in my inventory and
there they will stay
yeah I know the middle make that quick
stuff I think I'm just gonna feel around
for there
yeah
oh shit the famine all right playtime's
over
I could try and kill them now but
honestly they'll just respond I I may as
well wait until after midnight
meantime I have a site
why are you immune
sources not to start pretty soon I'm
gonna fuck alone
let's go straight there
have I gotten every dead rising
achievement I think just by naturally
playing it I'm I'm close but I don't I
don't go out of my way to get
achievements I really don't care that
much about them

[C] now the fat man only demands food once
well technically twice he demands it
before you can recruit him but after you
get into the security room there's a
special thing that pops up later working
will demand food yes
this is the one one one item of food to
recruit him and then one to placate him
after he's already already been in your
safe house safe room I guess it's not
really a house and safe sea seaweed we
are saved
yeah the neutral in Wolfenstein is good
I'm gonna have to try the new
Wolfenstein
that
I have to hope my chainsaw last me
through isabella ha that could be bad
now now I've got to get through one of
the most difficult AUSA's in the game
and my magical chainsaw might break all
I could do I got time I'm gonna do a
bubble off first that'll solve that
problem I'm not gonna risk it as much as
I want to get the story quest out of the
way first just to be safe I can't risk
it
I should have kept that Queen man well
you don't want to get them we'll be fine
or I wanted to do things in is gonna be
slightly different but perfect run is
still doable I'll just work what is this
and you guys got Queen give me a queen
my queen zombies over here nope nope
nope nope how long we'll do this the
hard way

got upgraded why not great yeah
yeah
yeah if I have one actual complaint with
the game it's it's that stoop ki they

I would have zero problems with the game
what I get what I get
what was my goody lift-up knee drop all
right all right
suplex and me drop good
Oh
we go hey
how far am I I'd say the halfway point
fair
it's basically just
I'll stop for one second
whole a way to talk to you why don't I
have a gun I have time to grab one I
just changed over about all this anyway
are you a reporter I can skip cutscenes
but I'm not going to
it's my quirk and I like it so let go
you're hurting me
besides these cutscenes are like the
only fucking break I'm getting how much
do you already know
have you called for help hold your
horses babe I'm the one asking the
questions here
what is Santa cabeza and how is it
connected to all this
the zombies were created by you not us
that's what Carlito wants you all to
know who if you want to interview
someone talk to Carlito he has all the
answers
you're talking about that guy that took
potshots at us with a sniper rifle
aren't you
take me to him no not now he's injured
and then no mood to talk to anyone
I'll bring him to you once he's
recovered
I can persuade him I'm his little sister
after all
why should I trust you to bring him to
me
the zombies are a message from Carlito
he wanted people to know
fine
go
when will he be back
tonight at midnight
wait for us in the store next to the
camera shop in the North Plaza
I'm Isabella by the way and I promise
I'll come back
all right very áfourá you think the
story and this is awful I respectfully
disagree actually quite like the story
in this game someone else I think it was
the Cobra ISM thinks that Isabella
doesn't look human
you think she looks like a werewolf I
think Isabella is one of the hottest
women in all of the gaming
I'm a strange dude because I'm attracted
to dark-haired women one there
wonder me to blunder
yeah
all right now that the start of this
great earlier on this way I was talking
about the the unappreciated benefits of
the large chainsaw I am going to show
you one of them in a minute all right I
got my ronald foods that's okay I hope
to god I don't forget to eat them now I
get back that would be bad yeah Otis I
get it I get it oh this
I can't say how long I've been playing I
don't remember what time I started looks
like
72 yards I can blow his head off clothed
from here could I take a shot dad
getting a head shot from here's no big
deal jack think you can pull it off
Thomas but daddy he ain't no zombie he's
just a man Thomas
we're doing this to survive you know
that
yeah we're worse they expect me to mind
this is all this is all given widest
arrogance Thomas come on Thomas shoot
shoot him shoot him Thomas

[D] now
what are you waiting for
do it
let's just chainsaw magic all right
maybe not when this works it works great
all right I know this works once you're
chasing them back but they're running
away
you just keep using them
I did this once I didn't get shot quite
so many times
watch her alright wasn't as smooth as I
wanted that to be but it worked it can
you save Thomas nope
you cannot save Thomas there is a boss
you can save no which is fun
come on well how's that student so I can
hold your hand
can you ignore Thomas no because then
you're not gonna be able to save this
guy in here he won't he won't join you
until the other snipers are dead
so Thomas is just he's fucked it's a
shame these kind of a somewhat
sympathetic Thomas but is what it is oh
no I didn't mean to do Jolie I'm sorry I
was going for the sake
follow me
come on
okay there's many song he's up here come
on swing caught on something go right
there
oh if he hasn't joined yet
follow me
can ice three my stolen grand theft auto
some more oh yeah
not right now wait for me over there
actually I need you to come in Joey come
on
Oh fuck's sake come on
are you flirting on me fantastic watch
perfect
you're so kind I'm really sorry
come on
over there you guys wait outside oh my
tea that's stuck in this door I'm gonna
talk to Floyd for an hour and a half
join fortunately we're doing really good
on time
Grand Theft Auto five no debt no
spooky Dookie to answer your question no
survivors lost we are currently on a
perfect run and I am going to remind
myself again don't forget to feed Ronald
I know that's a strange thing to just
say but it's it's kind of important
just join Floyd fuck got a sword and go
outside
wait I've got good news you're getting a
fat loss come on follow me
what know what that's a plus one home
right here I'm using this Thanks follow
me
I just know you idiots are gonna go down
the up escalator I just I just know it
in my heart my heart
over there
over there
don't forget to feed Ronnie also don't
forget to feed Ronald was it there we go
there we go
follow me almost forgot about Ronald and
I keep reminding myself to feed Ronald
cuz that would be bad that would be
almost be enough to make me want to quit
Wayne that's good but don't don't hit
our allies because it sucks when your
allies hit you doesn't it Rachel where
the fuck are you going and why are you
going
what happens to Ronald if he doesn't
meet the wrong reason
every survivor in that room is going to
leave with him to find room and then
they're all going to die because they
get eaten by zombies when they go out to
find food
Ronald basically in the middle of
starting I'm doing right now and the
only way he'll stop mutiny is if I feed
him he's a pig
Americans are over there feed Ronald
don't forget to feed Ronald the most
important thing here is to remember to
feed love
I had my bag of chips out and ready to
go I can't forget this follow me my way
got away got away
I really owe you one
you learn anything new on this end santa
cabeza is a stronghold of the central
american drug trade
the professor here seems to think that
the zombies are a byproduct of these
drugs oh my god yeah you're right I
might eat those chips by accident oh my
god me first thing I'm doing but he's
having this cutscene on be drugs
switching items thank you thank you for
what
what would making the Dead come to life
accomplish their terrorists don't try to
explain their actions with logic I've
analyzed the drug in question and I've
reported my findings for the government
that must be what set him off they
didn't want to be exposed
I've I've told you everything I know now
get me out of there call for help and
kill those creeps transect you say oh
god this game is actually about the war
on terror no actually this game is
actually about how fat Americans are
you'll see as we get there but this the
real plot is about how fat we are in
America well I'm say Williams assuming
that everybody in the chat is from the
United States of America
alright I didn't switch it up just leave
it to me
it says well I I've got time to kill
alright gonna feed Ronald rattle pick
fuckface
I understand
No
yes he just pushed me I haven't
tolerated I don't really have much
choice
uh-huh I'm sure no parallels between
this game in the war on terror
I'm just saying you'll see it's it's an
odd one it's about what we eat it's
about how help gluttonous in general the
United States is selfish and and and the
selfish gluttons because this game is
Japanese and that's that's how they feel
about us Americans are so fat and stupid
let's make a game about it they won't
even know this yeah
well since I use the katana
we're good on top I'm gonna say two
quick steps is acceptable and make more
later if I have to what am i doing what
do I need to do what should I be doing
we're gonna kill time to the food court
I'm gonna keep some wine in my inventory
because there's another know it's not a
side quest where you're in danger of
losing people eyes you are with Ronald
because I didn't feed of everyone in
that room with Ronald would have
disappeared and they'd all be dead
500 siege points right one of those guys
who kill but I'm not risking getting
knocked out inopportune time oh you know
what I would place my chainsaw yes yeah
this game thinks all Americans are
either fat or memo zombies yes that's
the central theme
wall kick Alice so so situational comic
result
alright I'm just running around earning
some spirit points while killing time I
don't want killed too much time
you
did you get something from using ever
wonder close to that now because I
rescued Floyd the old guy I was carrying
around I'm gonna start carrying a bottle
of wine to fulfill one of his requests
later on though nowhere near is urgent
as the one for Ronald Ronald
all right few minutes spare
whoo
so there's everyone doing
yes I'm going to kill the car guy
sometime after midnight but it's not
after midnight just yet or even even if
it is I got to be here for Isabella
which is right now
how many people were in this town again
53 odd thousand maybe 54 there is an
achievement for killing over that many
zombies
well you bidden no it was Carlito I
tried to talk him into coming but it was
no good he does look just anyone he shot
you he didn't mean to he was upset
I don't know is that better Chiva is how
you get the Mega Buster I've gotten it
before it's boring
you basically have to drive around in
the tunnels with the car for like six
hours
who
does the Mega Buster fun it's it's
amusing it's extremely powerful it kills
the bosses in like one shot

[E - 02h00m to 02h10m]


[E - 02h10m to 02h20m]


[E - 02h20m to 02h30m]
guys better be on that student time
Oh
go get up here climb up climb up
classroom climb up the Stu
Oh
uh-huh
what is your name
Isabella Isabella keys
well Isabella this is an emergency so
we'll skip the formalities and cut to
the chase
consider this an official interrogation
tell me everything that you know have
not forgotten the line thank you for
reminding them fine I'll explain why all
of this is your fault there was no drug
trade in Santa cabeza just an American
research facility they were doing Dignan
rules man what did you send me like a
wasp a wasp that turns living war jack
jack jack looks like he's back hi jack
if you don't believe me just ask the man
who was in charge of that research the
head of the Santa Caracas dog really not
only did I say lay this time so far I
have saved everybody this is a Dead
Rising god run
it started it's turning
helicopter the only achievement on going
for is my own personal sense of
achievement and satisfaction I'm going
to have a fucking Dead Rising perfect
run starting from fucking scratch tell
me the truth dog were you conducting
experiments with zombies
some please
where you were conducting experiments to
reduce the cost of breeding we
accidentally made zombie livestock so
the government's now in the zombie
making business the whole story about
the drug trade was a cover-up
what do you know we were trying to kill
you any idea how much meat Americans
research was absolutely
I
one day in my village the people turned
into zombies
those damn wasps they escaped from the
lab it wasn't long before they got to
work some spray the army was golden and
the money shot I love this game
so the terrorism is a retaliation for a
cruel government cover-up sounds
plausible or it could be some serious
bullshit in either case we have to get
out of here alive if we want to find out
for sure we have to check if she's been
bitten let me take a look I'm a medical
technician I could be useful if you let
me do my job I know I have no right to
ask but please let me help
if you don't get out of here the truth
dies with you
all right
if allowing you to atone for you and
your brothers scheme makes things go
more smoothly for us I'm all for it
all right back in the cell if wine - man
thanks I appreciate whoa I got a neck
twist you're so kind thanks thanks
Thanks

gonna trust you with my with my side
this comedy routine
come on
this is why you don't want to escort two
cripples all right guilt
oh come on
okay why don't you people use your
shotguns fucking right you're giving me
that chainsaw back right now
let me don't get too close and shit
deadly a deadly deadly weapon a Debbie
killing it strange that so many times
now you're a moment help see how this
works
alright that's the worst of it Susan
so close so close so amazingly close oh
holy fuck balls
holy fuck balls
come on go
you guys want to dance you know what Oh
dance
yeah that's fine
follow me
thank you
oh wow holy fuck I have never done this
well before Oh
ah
chap you may have just saved my ass by
reminding me about Kendall now I
appreciate you no option to talk to him
I think it's good thank you very much I
hope it's good
all right well I had to kill time we
need a chainsaw so we're gonna chainsaw
the Kendall problem is Kendall starts a
mutiny and takes away a quarter of my
survivors at some point he's gonna do it
apparently he hasn't done yet
I'm sure that's what ODIs was trying to
grab me about but it wasn't giving me
the option to talk to him so
hopefully that wasn't just a glitch
why no I didn't answer the phone but
still I still think that mission would
come up even if I didn't answer the
phone it would be internal I don't know
a lot of things
but I did try to talk to Kendall
it wasn't letting me I'm a little bit
worried it's some kind of weird glitchy
thing and when I get back quarter of my
survivors are gonna be gone I'm a lot
and I'm not actually I'm I'm a lot
worried about that
because now I have no idea what call me
maybe it's just for me is that we're
never getting a call for Leroy why I
saved so maybe everything's good maybe
hopefully I'm not sure entirely
everything's good
make some quick step I I have no healing
items yes it's the third day and I
actually have a lot of the
pain-in-the-ass type of stuff taking
care of this is going too well it's
frightening
right off to the security room
it's a lot of real estate publish should
want a quick step better safe than sorry
yes yes check this game again saw like I
didn't say I was going to try another no
just run on a non normal streaming night
I do want to make sure I beat Kent
exactly what is this last resort talk
all the balance
Carlitos it yeah I plan on checking
Kendall gun even though I didn't get a
call damn who's got a regular suicide
bomber on our hands then what you're
thinking the explosion would send
parasitic larvae into their atmosphere
he plans to spread zombies outside of
the city is he insane
that bomb goes off there'll be nowhere
to run the zombies will be everywhere
he's planning to flood the area
underneath the mall with flammable gas
then set it off if you could take care
of the bombs while the gas concentration
is still low one sabotage Kendall Sonora
way I'm gonna double-check anyway let's
do it
I'm so close to rescuing everybody I'm
not gonna risk losing a quarter of them
