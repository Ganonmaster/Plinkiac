have control over what gets upgraded or
if it's random its semi random like
you're you're never gonna get like the
the the move that rips your Dom bees
guts out you're never gonna get that
early so there's there's kind of like
ones you're a lot more likely to get
early and and things you're not going to
get until later on but there's it is
randomized like you don't know if you're
gonna get attack upgrade or help upgrade
or a speed upgrade or a new move you're
not sure what you're gonna get

follow me
someone in the chat is asking is this a
no death run or a no one dies run it's
the same I'm I appreciate trying for
both if somebody dies I'm still gonna do
a a no death run where I don't die but
my goal is not to lose anybody I don't
know that I'm gonna pull that off I've
never pulled that off he's stabilized
you should be fine for me and over the
best ending a couple people died I'm not
I'm not killing them their storyline
deaths so I'm you whatever you whatever
you whatever you whatever

[B] yeah
must be from that girl I saved girl was
she hurt I offered to help her but she
took off can't really blame her for
running from a guy with your looks
anyway she was saying something about
Santa cabeza Santa cabeza I think I owe
dr. Barnaby you're awake Santa cabeza I
should have known I thought Santa cabeza
was over and done with
you plan to dispense justice now calm
down doctor Barnaby we're only following
orders we have to protect that you texts
more like imprison professor if we're
going to protect you we need to know the
truth all of it I think I think no
matter what you can't say talk to us
everybody in any of the the other
endings I think the best you can do is
53 people rescued out of 50 great
because somebody survives one ending
that doesn't survive the other and
whatnot fine I'll just get my
information somewhere else thank you
very much
maybe if I can track down that woman
again
back into the breach
yeah
I did remember to take a photo of the
air duct I don't let me make sure I
remember to save it I did say yes
it's time
I'm fed up with a photo challenge
enough I can do it
it was such a pain in the ass

but whatever whatever

mostly because I am I'm seriously going
for this note depth on hopefully perfect
run and you Philip it would be
distracting I know why it's because

how many days when are we worth about
halfway through day two
to the salvation of the soul
is the purging of the cake and also I
have been saving this time I've been
saving at the beginning of new pcs
mostly I'm gonna have a run timing is
tight I can't afford to go run off to
save constantly I make much out will
sing yes these guys these guys here
these cultists they can hit you with
knockout gas and kidnap you what should
that happens that's gonna fuck my entire
run these guys and the back my head I'm
terrified of these guys well let me get
into Mega Man stuff but I'm probably not
gonna bother actually I'm playing for me
fresh profile I don't think I even have
me the costume online so yes I know
Frank is an ass but really that's what
makes it interesting
oh shit all dead before they can use
knockout gas so good
always hold hands
fucking wall of zombies I could not get
the most awful that was just awful
earn for rich if the zombie apocalypse
breaks up just hold your fiance's hands

hang that judo throw almost a chainsaw
I'm going to go make some quick step
before another source comes up I'm
definitely not going to try and rescue
anybody from wonderland Plaza right now
is that not enough time not enough time
well cut and run there activate the next
story thing first also because of Ronald
I got to remember from this night
forward to always carry a food item with
me because his his little side quest
thing his little request from the office
if I don't give him food I'm gonna lose
a whole bunch of survivors so when I get
that call I'm gonna want food on him so
there are chips in my inventory and
there they will stay
yeah I know the middle make that quick
stuff I think I'm just gonna feel around
for there
yeah
oh shit the famine all right playtime's
over
I could try and kill them now but
honestly they'll just respond I I may as
well wait until after midnight
meantime I have a site
why are you immune
sources not to start pretty soon I'm
gonna fuck alone
let's go straight there
have I gotten every dead rising
achievement I think just by naturally
playing it I'm I'm close but I don't I
don't go out of my way to get
achievements I really don't care that
much about them
