have control over what gets upgraded or
if it's random its semi random like
you're you're never gonna get like the
the the move that rips your Dom bees
guts out you're never gonna get that
early so there's there's kind of like
ones you're a lot more likely to get
early and and things you're not going to
get until later on but there's it is
randomized like you don't know if you're
gonna get attack upgrade or help upgrade
or a speed upgrade or a new move you're
not sure what you're gonna get

lost anybody yet we are currently
perfect little bit behind Spa I'm not
super happy follow me
but I'm scheme of things not bad not bad
follow me
someone in the chat is asking is this a
no death run or a no one dies run it's
the same I'm I appreciate trying for
both if somebody dies I'm still gonna do
a a no death run where I don't die but
my goal is not to lose anybody I don't
know that I'm gonna pull that off I've
never pulled that off he's stabilized
you should be fine for me and over the
best ending a couple people died I'm not
I'm not killing them their storyline
deaths so I'm you whatever you whatever
you whatever you whatever

[B] yeah
must be from that girl I saved girl was
she hurt I offered to help her but she
took off can't really blame her for
running from a guy with your looks
anyway she was saying something about
Santa cabeza Santa cabeza I think I owe
dr. Barnaby you're awake Santa cabeza I
should have known I thought Santa cabeza
was over and done with
you plan to dispense justice now calm
down doctor Barnaby we're only following
orders we have to protect that you texts
more like imprison professor if we're
going to protect you we need to know the
truth all of it I think I think no
matter what you can't say talk to us
everybody in any of the the other
endings I think the best you can do is
53 people rescued out of 50 great
because somebody survives one ending
that doesn't survive the other and
whatnot fine I'll just get my
information somewhere else thank you
very much
maybe if I can track down that woman
again
back into the breach
yeah
I did remember to take a photo of the
air duct I don't let me make sure I
remember to save it I did say yes
it's time
I'm fed up with a photo challenge
enough I can do it
it was such a pain in the ass
Oh
fuck it
I'm superstar so close to leveling up
but whatever whatever
yes I am I am solo tonight
mostly because I am I'm seriously going
for this note depth on hopefully perfect
run and you Philip it would be
distracting I know why it's because

the time I'm done beating information
out of you

all right plenty of time for that what
am i I'm sure on time for something Oh
Kent ah that makes everything horrible I
could do it I can do it

Oh
beginner's luck that's all what's
happened one more just one more contest

favourite games of all time I fucking
adore Dead Rising so I've got experience
Oh

idiot

rescue before another source I could do
it if you all cooperate with me whoo boy
all right
yeah school like that
behold the end of the world is upon us
how many days when are we worth about
halfway through day two
to the salvation of the soul
is the purging of the cake and also I
have been saving this time I've been
saving at the beginning of new pcs
mostly I'm gonna have a run timing is
tight I can't afford to go run off to
save constantly I make much out will
sing yes these guys these guys here
these cultists they can hit you with
knockout gas and kidnap you what should
that happens that's gonna fuck my entire
run these guys and the back my head I'm
terrified of these guys well let me get
into Mega Man stuff but I'm probably not
gonna bother actually I'm playing for me
fresh profile I don't think I even have
me the costume online so yes I know
Frank is an ass but really that's what
makes it interesting
oh shit all dead before they can use
knockout gas so good
always hold hands
fucking wall of zombies I could not get
the most awful that was just awful
earn for rich if the zombie apocalypse
breaks up just hold your fiance's hands
as Casper you know what I do that anyway
I'm sent out for you yes sir
what
all right stocked up always good loved
that stock one of my skills looking like
that's a lot double-berry it
Oh roundhouse kick hand the lift up all
right those are all good things
hang that judo throw almost a chainsaw
I'm going to go make some quick step
before another source comes up I'm
definitely not going to try and rescue
anybody from wonderland Plaza right now
is that not enough time not enough time
well cut and run there activate the next
story thing first also because of Ronald
I got to remember from this night
forward to always carry a food item with
me because his his little side quest
thing his little request from the office
if I don't give him food I'm gonna lose
a whole bunch of survivors so when I get
that call I'm gonna want food on him so
there are chips in my inventory and
there they will stay
yeah I know the middle make that quick
stuff I think I'm just gonna feel around
for there
yeah
oh shit the famine all right playtime's
over
I could try and kill them now but
honestly they'll just respond I I may as
well wait until after midnight
meantime I have a site
why are you immune
sources not to start pretty soon I'm
gonna fuck alone
let's go straight there
have I gotten every dead rising
achievement I think just by naturally
playing it I'm I'm close but I don't I
don't go out of my way to get
achievements I really don't care that
much about them

[C] now the fat man only demands food once
well technically twice he demands it
before you can recruit him but after you
get into the security room there's a
special thing that pops up later working
will demand food yes
this is the one one one item of food to
recruit him and then one to placate him
after he's already already been in your
safe house safe room I guess it's not
really a house and safe sea seaweed we
are saved
yeah the neutral in Wolfenstein is good
I'm gonna have to try the new
Wolfenstein
that
I have to hope my chainsaw last me
through isabella ha that could be bad
now now I've got to get through one of
the most difficult AUSA's in the game
and my magical chainsaw might break all
I could do I got time I'm gonna do a
bubble off first that'll solve that
problem I'm not gonna risk it as much as
I want to get the story quest out of the
way first just to be safe I can't risk
it
I should have kept that Queen man well
you don't want to get them we'll be fine
or I wanted to do things in is gonna be
slightly different but perfect run is
still doable I'll just work what is this
and you guys got Queen give me a queen

hard way

what was my goody lift-up knee drop all
right all right
suplex and me drop good
Oh

how far am I I'd say the halfway point
fair
it's basically just
I'll stop for one second
whole a way to talk to you why don't I
have a gun I have time to grab one I
just changed over about all this anyway
are you a reporter I can skip cutscenes
but I'm not going to
it's my quirk and I like it so let go
you're hurting me
besides these cutscenes are like the
only fucking break I'm getting how much
do you already know
have you called for help hold your
horses babe I'm the one asking the
questions here
what is Santa cabeza and how is it
connected to all this
the zombies were created by you not us
that's what Carlito wants you all to
know who if you want to interview
someone talk to Carlito he has all the
answers
you're talking about that guy that took
potshots at us with a sniper rifle
aren't you
take me to him no not now he's injured
and then no mood to talk to anyone
I'll bring him to you once he's
recovered
I can persuade him I'm his little sister
after all
why should I trust you to bring him to
me
the zombies are a message from Carlito
he wanted people to know
fine
go
when will he be back
tonight at midnight
wait for us in the store next to the
camera shop in the North Plaza
I'm Isabella by the way and I promise
I'll come back
all right very áfourá you think the
story and this is awful I respectfully
disagree actually quite like the story
in this game someone else I think it was
the Cobra ISM thinks that Isabella
doesn't look human
you think she looks like a werewolf I
think Isabella is one of the hottest
women in all of the gaming
I'm a strange dude because I'm attracted
to dark-haired women one there
wonder me to blunder
yeah
all right now that the start of this
great earlier on this way I was talking
about the the unappreciated benefits of
the large chainsaw I am going to show
you one of them in a minute all right I
got my ronald foods that's okay I hope
to god I don't forget to eat them now I
get back that would be bad yeah Otis I
get it I get it oh this
I can't say how long I've been playing I
don't remember what time I started looks
like
72 yards I can blow his head off clothed
from here could I take a shot dad
getting a head shot from here's no big
deal jack think you can pull it off
Thomas but daddy he ain't no zombie he's
just a man Thomas
we're doing this to survive you know
that
yeah we're worse they expect me to mind
this is all this is all given widest
arrogance Thomas come on Thomas shoot
shoot him shoot him Thomas
