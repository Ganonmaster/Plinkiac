sorry everyone's gonna miss out in the
shoutouts all right who were the people
they were Dillon you said after after
all this I forgot to put Dillon in here
Dillon gruff gruff miss military and
beefcake of the leftover variety all
right for the sake of chopping this up
later because is gonna have to go up
separate from everything that went
before it I was going to be an FTL no
pause run I'm here doing a solo stream
because Jack couldn't make it in Lisa
had to go do something work-related I'm
not sure what and he had to stay home
and watch the kids and so I just came in
and I'm streaming alone I'm gonna play
some FTL no we're gonna go for a no
pause run so no pausing on this run
start I'm playing on normal
and I want to go get a mousepad a proper
mousepad because it's gonna be
impossible on this board I have right
back right
all right we're beginning again we start
Oh for crying out loud all right jump
maybe why I hate nebulous
Oh everyone's mic in my face
blue events taking the blue
it's gonna be difficult with a stealth
ship actually it's gonna be this really
dump ship to do this with yep as this is
not gonna work now with this ship I
think we have to get a different ship
for this
yeah well time
all right what are you oh wait now still
Jim I definitely don't want asteroids
oh that's good
now No
this is insane why did I try this
good this is not gonna last long I would
have tried this if this fells early I
won't try another run don't worry about
that and is gonna fill very early oh oh
no I I accidentally put back to the I
don't know how that happened like how
did that happen I never have good luck
with the Mantis show and I don't want to
do boarding
I wanted to boarding or beams we're
gonna drool ship yeah that's a smart
call we're going with back with ruff and
and everyone
who was it was a done
Grif and beefcake
are you a barber beefcake is that
reference is that reference right nice
in this day and age or is that like a
what what's that old man talking about
talking about things that I don't know
because we're old
could check their offer
oh really come on come on hurry up no
drums chefs are just Opie alright no
pause runs
then again I am gonna have to constantly
worry about ammo
come on I'm gonna weapon sit him in the
weapons useless drone fuck oh good
I shouldn't has power good water oxygen
to have power
all right
doing
Russia
kind of boring kind of boring I wanted
to avoid the the Osprey or the was at
the castle I think because I guess
trolled because I used those all the
time but no pause and roam I don't feel
like there's that much different from a
regular pause run
and fucking drone keeps hitting that one
empty room doesn't do me any favours oh
he hit the other empty room while I'm
taking damage
this stream suddenly got really boring I
thought you people loved FTL as FC l no
longer beloved or is it only fun when
I'm blowing up okay people only gonna
deal and Devine defend the outpost
always always
I never really used the dreamchip much
before god it's at least early on this
things Opie
whatever got the storm
give rich a hat
Jack Jack is not here
this is going really really well so far
comically so
yes rich solo stream we were doing a
rich solo stream tonight Jack Jack could
not make it
jaga's Jack is babysitting his own
children

presume we will not hand over the
crewmembers of slavers come on like
that's never gonna happen
Oh deep our detour yeah you stop hitting
my weapons you fuckers did I remember to
when I had to restart the computer to
turn down the oh my god volume I'll fix
that in a second I'll fix that in a
second I am in a middle of a no pause
battle for life and death here people
people want to see me defeat the evils
so-and-so's right what we all want
I was a human okay alright there's
something fix problem and we'll continue
yep there we go
the Oh My gods have been decreased
that's it I have to nag jak2 to get that
where I don't know why Jack hasn't done
a jack is known there's been a problem
for like a month and a half and nothing

vieille ve ve oh and I think right
things for you on is there any in there
my brains telling there's an A in there
my heart's telling me there's not an A
in there I'm conflicted I'm conflicted
as it is fine it's fine it's just gonna
show up is the real anyway
it's it there's no way I didn't think
there was I thought there might have
gotten actually I can't yell if I didn't
think there was I wouldn't have had that
debate with myself so I guess I did kind
of think there was whatever we're going
on we're gonna shoot things and that's
that's fun it's fun to shoot things
that's what life has taught me I am
blast their asses
Oh barely I got an achievement yeah yay
beat the guy up
No Surrender haha this is FTL where I am
a bloodthirsty monster
well that's man that's not my pilot all
right we're doing okay we're doing okay
yeah
yeah I've got a path and everything
we're good we're good
no audio I knew I knew bringing the OBS
down what mute the game I'm so used to
Jack being here I almost turned to say
that to Jack which would have been
really weird considering Jack isn't here
fuck it does that work there's something
that works yes it's gonna have to do all
right
baby Slayer one five six says this has
been the most fun solo rich stream there
has ever been way to turn it up to 11
please tell Jack the next time you see
him they should stay away more often
wink wink the real van says I may not I
may not live to see our glory but I will
gladly join the fight and when our
children tell our story they'll tell the
story of tonight let's have another
round tonight is the thing solidarity my
brother man shoot my oxygen waive my
oxygen I need that
oh that's right I have magical healing
all right let's fine everyone
everything's fine
thank God I didn't sell that energy bed
box ship that would have been that would
have been a mistake the real van says
raise a glass to freedom something they
can never take away no matter what they
tell you where is a glass to the four of
us tomorrow there'll be more of us
telling the story of tonight solidarity
brother or something
oh just right now this instance I should
stick to the nebula I stretched my arms
tonight
yet if Jack was here he would remind me
to didn't he'd probably wouldn't under
distress matter
colors refreshing
it's got Mike
all right drones just doing all the damn
work quiz on ik one are you a fan of
happy clowns or sad clowns I'm a fan of
no clowns hate them clowns death -
clones down with the clown and I'm not
clowning around clown clown clown clown
I don't know I just say thanks it's my
job not even smart things anymore I just
gave up
yeah I don't suppose you can actually
shoot him anywhere important drone
I don't need missiles I need scrabble I
take fuel and as well Oh he's offering a
couple drones but I have the I think I
bought the drone yeah no no we're not
accepting you can die mister man even
the ICP rich especially the ICP fuck
those clowns
dude 26 three fuel I'm happy with that
our clowns worse than the bagpipes yes
there we go you know I'm gonna get a
shot off you motherfucker
yours dead dead in the water bitch bitch
yes this is a no pause run lots of scrap
I like that ooh
goddamnit not worth it
totally not worth it hey I got a store
anyway nothing I need though cloned by a
mind control hmm no no no no shields or
engines their own shields mind control
rod I would go mind control route if
this weren't a no pause run and this
weren't an NG ship I would I would I
would I would like to pair up mind
control with like boarding parties that
would be need damn get chills
you people are you you people in the
chat you're always a fan of shields I'm
getting shields this time I think it's
almost always better to go with engines
though shields don't block missiles
that's what kills you
missiles is what kills you
why was he time to find a store
start hitting those fucking weapons
something something hit weapons before I
get killed by the missiles that this
thing is firing at me that I have no
defense against oh no rape by missiles
rape by fucking missiles that's what
happened right there at least I got
something I could sell
a lot of fuel I'll take it
Jesus Christ what have I walked into
says inspector Google you've you've run
into a ain't no pause run like beats
says hope rich reads this so he gets the
detracted and blows up it says detracted
so he blows up and it has to say to play
FTL next stream like he promised even
though he already broke his promise when
he dies with the cloak ship and reset I
didn't break my promise with that many
the vert King the Vera King no pause run
P AWS a hashtag rich Evans hates furries
confirmed hates strong word I'm not a
furry but I don't I don't hate furries
if you want to get off looking at Bugs
Bunny and drag that is none of my
business and I know I know that was
horribly insulting and probably not an
accurate description of furry culture
it's a fucking joke it's a fucking joke
oh stop missing you fuck
I don't feel like this is much of a no
pause run god these is combat drones
make no pause runs fairly trivial
relatively trivial
all right take out those fucking shields
and never go back on keep them down
forever
yeah continue the song it's not a prick
all right kill this thing before those
weapons fire oh my god
that is why I didn't target the shields
initially because I knew a shot was
gonna get through because that thing was
armed to the fucking teeth but fair -
crap store there's always a store
whenever I upgrade like always unless I
check first
upgrade those engines like I did I did
that thing
all right all right I'm happy with that
but yeah I'm happy with my hook
why don't I use hotkeys cuz an FTL the
only real hotkey I need is pause I don't
mind clicking on things with the mouse
it's fine it's all fine maybe a maybe
maybe I'm maybe that doesn't make me a
hardcore enough gamer for you but that's
why I play deal
all three three sucks charge kind of
sucks good teleporter and right now
cloaking can't afford a bit expensive
anyway really hacking hacking
do I want hacking
do I want hacking you get that goddamn
laser the burst laser is a piece of the
the burst laser three is a piece of shit
for power for five shots ridiculous
ridiculous
half of them still miss not to flex for
that for power you get six shots and you
get a much shorter charge time because
that that fucking that puny five shots
four for power
yeah it's one three nineteen seconds
you're better off with two two power
weapons you get faster fire rate and you
fire it off more rounds burst three is
shit complete shit
whole laser - not super exciting
what I'm looking at is that hacking was
rich really complaining about burst
accuracy and then recommending flack
here's the thing with the verse 3 when
you're charged up time is 19 fucking
seconds every missed shot really fucking
hurts those those dual flax do you're
shooting those well yeah I got like like
10 second cooldown or something that is
it's it's much faster
now that were a burst laser - I'd be all
over that shit and I have to make a
hacking decision ah fuck it I don't
usually use it and why not where we'll
do different things occasionally it's
boring if I do the same shit and FTL
over and over
sorry lagging
there is a nun not exciting event in
heaven
right
that's a lot fuel and I don't want to
face those flak guns going off again
yeah I'll take the pride
yes sometimes the AI is dumb enough to
hack the camera I can't help that
it's good
oh they've got they've got some nasty
shit here alright
this will be a slow one
slow indeed alright fuck as long as I
can keep their weapons locked down
that'll be fine but a pain in the ass
you can't keep missing though you stupid
drum ship you can't miss all the time
that's not good that's bad keep shooting
them in the drone damn it
oh good no I'm not
why so heartless with that TL I'm not
heartless in other games and other games
I'm mr. good guy I save everybody I can
goodness is the only way FTL
die motherfucker why is that I'll take a
chance
if I I'll fight you I don't care I'll
fight anything fucker fuck you fucker
who the fuck do you think you are kill
everything I said I say kill everything
all the time I got a bunch of scrap I
can spend friendly and I firmly hold on
to it just to find a store or a good
weapon like what if I find another ion
blast too
we'll put some fuckers on lockdown
hey free free repair oh right that
worked out just great
attack him I get to the cash yes always
be attacking always always never stop
never stop attacking
you have no idea what's going on I am
doing a FTL no death run or not no death
run well they're all FTL no death runs
but no pause room though no crew have
died
that's not happen
de-stress gotta go to the distress nope
fuck you giant aliens fires not gonna
cool beverage to turn on you stupid
thing
many the Vera King says no Paul oh wait
no that's nothing

up right away for some reason I don't
get it I think I've been staring at the
screen too long my visions start to get
blurry

impossible

I looked at jump earlier but I was all
out of engine and it didn't work out

was frantically clicking on things Lutz

tried to get out of there I wanted to
get out of there
