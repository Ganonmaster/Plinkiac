I'm not super happy with how I'm doing
where's the power appeal
they want to hurt you Jason
don't let them
[Music]
[Music]

that's my special special boy
mommy but it's time to come home
like last year we had all the items they
knew they needed to fuck around with me
and Alyssa like they buff the
firecrackers used to be able to shift
through those this game our manhunt
manhunts pretty fucking good
[Music]
if you like manhunt you'd like the
Punisher game for the PlayStation 2 how
what are those two games have in common
come on come on you know damn well that
manhunt is is a stealth game a stealth
survival game and the Punisher is a
gamer you brutalize criminals I know the
Punisher game has a super ton of violent
kills if there's a PC version available
where I can aim with a goddamn mouse I
would be delighted to give the Punisher
game a shot as it is
I hate 99.5% of all games that our
shooters you have to play with the
controller the only reason that's 99.5
and not 100 is because of vanquish
yes third person with a mouse is fine I
don't know why people think that's a bad
thing why are they only Jason this is so
weird
make them remember Jason make them
suffer so weird I don't want to be Jason
[Music]
[Music]
can I can I choose not to purchase I
guess there's a priority
[Music]
all right that's right I'm not even
gonna find anyone
[Music]
[Music]
they want to hurt you Jason some bitch
[Music]
has a fucking pocket life no matter what
they do you cannot die
you can never die
that's my Jason that's my special
special they want to hurt you Jason
don't let them
[Music]

[Music]
now there's some people out there fuck
[Music]
[Music]
what I helped if I have my kills
selected to be quick
rather than fun but I stand by my choice
they want to hurt you Jason get up Jason
but it's time to come home
[Laughter]
well you got lucky but he made a choice
he kind of had to make
can people find their way in here

people Reilly say I accepted some friend

[Music]
five six total all right me see if I can
clear out what do I need two more people
to clear out cuz this is this is the
climax we might do one or one or two
more rounds forty-nine days I mean this
that's long enough I need I need to make
room in here I'm sorry I'm sorry person
I'm about to unfriend butBut we needs
that we needs the room we needs the room
all right
who'd I just accept
all right
there should be one more coming
like I said they're firing up the game
so we're since we're waiting on one more
we could worst comes to worst we could
play with seven that's that's good
enough
[Music]
first-timers huh all right all right
well that's fine you know what it's fine
that's just that's just more corpses
all right random map yeah random map and
here we go
no no random map Oh for fuck's sake
oh the mouse thing again
why won't you oh my god just start the
start the fucking game
why aren't you starting game well and
I'm trying to figure out why this isn't
starting cuz I'm an idiot
invite next map settings close lobby
I guess close lobby no no cancel what I
wanna close the lobby that's not a lot
at all ready there we go turn close the
lobby like we're all done we're all
ready the lobbyists closed and no one
else can join I completely
misinterpreted that all right for all
the for all the hassle of getting this
together we'll go we'll go two more
rounds to our rounds rich hit the ready
button on the right is trained I hit the
ready button I wasn't doing anything
kill Jason no no we have any
inexperience Jason I'm not going for a
frickin Jason kill that's just that's
just wholly unsatisfying unsatisfying or
you know blank screen that's fine
I'm fine with the blank screen is
anybody saying anything or is this some
glitch that's unique to be here I'm
getting nothing
that is everybody who joined are you
getting a blank screen in your game oh
game
alright restart the game I think we're
we're fucked
oh no my gonna have to go into freakin
all right I'm gonna have to go into task
manager to kill the game all right did
what I had to do all right everybody
close the game and restart the game
we're gonna do this again
and unless relentless doesn't want it
I'm gonna set it so that released
relentless gets their chance to be Jason
because that's that's just fair man no
it's not even now it's not even starting
there goes there goes you don't care
about being Jason okay I know some
people don't like the pressure that
comes with being Jason if I'm playing
with a lot of people who have not played
this game before I definitely do not
want to play as Jason
technical difficulties live look that's
the game crashing that's that's not like
our fault as done I did
[Music]
all right waiting for uh there we go all
right why won't you let me ready up game
what let me rip why are you being such a
persnickety game today why I don't want
to go to my profile there we go what the
fuck what the fuck
yeah Mike my game is not letting me
ready up easily
oh no is it me
this is gonna be me I don't want it to
be me oh no I can't get a match for him
not Jason
it's not gonna happen all right then I
play with first-timers I am I am not
going to use trap strats no trap strats
maybe no traps no traps traps and no
shift
[Music]
[Music]
look if I wanted just a slaughterhouse
I'd play against the bots they're
probably listening I want you anyway
probably I think if your streaming is
Jason it's a huge huge distant well no
way
Jason's less of a disadvantage and
somebody playing as Jason's stream
sniping you as a counselor all right
nope no trap strats no shift there's our
one
there's your free one enjoy it
[Music]
[Music]
we all lost connection I think all right
damn you Friday the 13th the game why
are you buggy I can't even I can't even
I can't even close this stupid game okay
we we are going to try this one more
time we're gonna try this one more time
and that I apologize but we're done
Richard sure our patient bastard I am I
really am don't invite mr. glitch why
because he's glitching the game I don't
I don't think that's how usernames work
all right invite him
all right people that seem to be finding
your way in on your own
yeah not cause that it's my own ed
all right this game never had the most
stable netcode already in could be
number of things
okay mostly regular my ping is just
excellent
so I need to send out one more invite
all right
I'm just happy to be here Sam
there we go
okay good luck if it glitches this time
it's been fun everybody it's been fun
so far so good don't hold your breath
inge my life
part three could see the positive crash
I'm in a game I'm not Jason and we're
not crashing yet and I have a bridge
all right and I might I'm gonna
respectfully ask whoever is a generic
white male to mute the stream say you
don't get an unfair advantage I don't
know if you will or not but I can only
ask nicely
shit ain't now nah call for a kill
I'll settle for the stun damage
all right well I found nothing yet but
you're watching the stream you can you
can see that yeah I've got jack shit
some mapping here if you need one the
gas
all right
we find the propeller we can go for the
boat I'm down
should I gas it up now or way
wait because somebody gets the car
battery and that's probably our best way
out
basically if we find the propeller we go
for the boat if we find a battery we go
for the car
[Music]
all right you know probably gonna end up
getting out with the cops
you know I got the propeller we can fix
the boat go for it I'll back you up
how many people can go on the boat -
just - I'll hang back it's fine
these parts we've got horrible water
speed that's a fun thing like part
sevens good at waters heat part three
and four have a physical water speed so
we should be fine if we get the boats
well you're good at wet bikini speed
that hot wet ass is smooth as butter
[Laughter]
he's here
[Music]
[Music]
good second where somebody forgotten
rich
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
what would Cameron Mitchell say whoever
did that what would Cameron Mitchell say
move Jarvis house
[Music]
oh shit this is a dead end that's not
good
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
run for heads
[Music]
[Music]
good game good game good game thanks
rich no property no problem well well
providing there's no more glitching
we'll do one more if you want
yeah I think the reason the cop is so
trigger-happy is they've all watched
surviving edged weapons and they see
that guy with a edged weapon and better
see if I'm sorry
now if they'd seen Friday the 13th they
wouldn't bother
I think the only time like the police or
the military were able to kill him was
in part 9 I just wanted that go to hell
1 yeah missile on him or whatever Jason
joins the army to be fair he survived
that how do I dance like Crispin Glover
the emotes Nemo is it really yeah
there's a dance dance party pack
whatever DLC and a part 7 kill pack for
some reason apart 7
that's that's not part two you're
thinking of where the medical examiner
ate Jason's I think it was his heart and
then became the new Jason that was part
nine I think Jason goes to hell or as
it's also known the horrible one
[Music]
I gotta get out of here now archery
range
shotgun spawn holding a shotgun spawn is
there Jason
all right I don't know if they're a noob
or not it might be a noob car-boat see
see if we can find anything interesting
in here that gasps get a Salinas had
just cars the fun way out right I mean I
could go for the boat in theory
I wish the car cars all the way over
there shit I'll gladly take that
pocketknife ax
[Music]
well I got gas the boats right here do
we want to walk this over to the car or
do we want to look for the compeller all
right I'm gonna take this over to the
car I'll watch your six
[Music]
[Music]
well someone happened over here
I heard you take a quick peek around
it's diluted I think Jason's over by the
car
[Music]
okay I have a wrench
take that I'll take that
[Music]
[Music]
Dora
[Music]
[Music]
mr. glitch is not fucking around not
fucking around
[Music]
this is new music I like it I was that
part for Jason
[Music]
shit
[Music]
[Music]
got it actually
[Music]
run shit sure it's what it's fine it's
fine run run run
[Music]
well Tommy Jarvis what we need is a
battery and a key I just picked up a key
I bet it just picked up a radio I'm
sorry does anybody have the keys or a
battery what I meant to do
[Music]
batteries got me sore about a funny car
love that music
[Music]
the reason is great
like that
[Music]
[Music]
battery battery battery battery battery
battery no battery
[Music]
[Music]
it's time to get out of here I am
starting to feel like Plan B is an order
I got a spray
I'm right behind you with some spray
all right desperately needing color
[Music]
[Music]
to check here right sometimes it spawns
right in here yeah fuck this up search
this way and we're gonna find that
goddamn propeller and we're gonna get
out as we're a selfish motherfucker
[Music]
[Music]
rich there's chat are the bus chad is
already fucked alright
they're completely and utterly fucked my
only hope is that somebody blatantly
missed the propeller and it's nearby
shit alright that is not my only home I
have no home I am kind of fucked I might
be able to time it out I'm gonna go on
record as saying that the boat Escape is
hopeless
[Music]
Cameron Mitchell
[Music]
oh shit oh you got me behind you just
got screwed nice work nice work
[Music]
screwdriver to your head huh good boy
mommy has a reward for you come home
Robocop in the same way well it wasn't
the screwdriver I think it was that
interface thing oh that's right
and then to him shooting dick Jones
after he gets fired I'll tell you what
if you want I'll go one more and exactly
one more one more
I like this game too much alright hey no
problem no problem all right I'm gonna
quick and check and see if I can find a
replacement real quick all right I'm
gonna take a bio break as we used to say
in or craft yeah can you give me just a
couple minutes get a that's fine that's
fine
Karin is not gonna have a lonely night
Karen is visiting her mother right now
so I'm fine I'm absolutely fine
Jason it's it's that I gotta kill rich
Evans adrenaline
Clem is already inherent
Oh what's already here mr. glitches
already in if your esteemed friend I
just so you know I am currently looking
for more people to invite let's see if
there's anyone else in Hull from the old
friends list yeah I didn't even say when
guess I'll be this preppy bastard now
well five hundred and six days ago
that's that's a get rid of them
many people do we need to all right I
have I have room for exactly two people
if you've sent me a friend request which
there's room now I have room for two so
I'm not gonna be able to take everybody
but start up your game if you've got a
request pending here all right
invites and I wasn't able the other one
yes a weapon of a more civilized age hey
you can tell what that was
yeah I know it's kind of sad it's very
sad yeah I know it's only one of the
most famous sound effects in the world
different over the speaker that's how
that just seemed to like no humming
sound that was one of them Star Wars
you're right about that lately
well most iconic sound effects of Star
Wars someone gave a gave me one for
Christmas cool friend of mine gave me
the grow over the rogue one blu-ray for
Christmas that's better than a kick in
the teeth I got a blue lightsaber so low
kind of the best things come on Star
Wars and recent memories is the cartoon
rebels
they can do some interesting stuff with
the floors why blind Jedi guy he's
basically what's that movie Satya
something's a th e or is that what to
change that OED that's it
played by Freddie Prinze jr. and he's
great yeah so Disney XD which means if
you live in the state's you probably get
it and you have to resort to third
parties like us Canadians well at least
this lightsaber serve his purpose and
started a conversation silly bill war
which Disney introduced turns out
there's the Mandalorians you like the
Boba Fett's the whole defense those guys
Jango Fett's they have they have their
own special lightsaber called the dark
saber well now here's how it gets silly
the dark saber
it's a black light saber oh it's got
katana shaped blade silly in Star Wars
yeah missus stars rebels the Darksaber
because one of the characters in Star
Wars rebels is based in the Mandalorian
version of King Arthur using the dark
saber
digitally their holy sacred sword from
the only everything for the same time
does some cool stuff with like which the
force and the Jedi and there's just like
other third party called the Ben do
which is neither light nor dark touches
on it better than last Jedi did I think
yeah I'm getting a little sick
[Laughter]
double-a batteries all right I think the
last couple of people I I accepted a
friend request from didn't actually have
the games we're just we're just gonna
start a man down it'll be fine go start
the game
why is it doing that we're just mismatch
equality on the other hand you have the
episodes with I think the character's
name is Cain in the lime Jedi guy which
are really cool like insights into the
force and stuff then you got stuff like
the Mandalore episodes which feel like
Star Trek the Klingons if they're
written by an idiot oh boy there's a
loaded comment there one villain has a
weapon designed to specifically target
Mandalorian armor to stop the Star Wars
by starting the game and it's not
letting me start all right
start the game i think i'm diarrhea now
I keep trying to start the game but
every time I hit a - ready up it just
goes me into the mute or unmute little
menu it's driving me crazy I think it's
because your focus has changed from
Mouse to controller to Mouse it seems to
happen when you move the mouse I don't
know it's just whatever there's been
some weird changes in the interface
level
tried not to move the mouse when you're
using the controller I'm definitely not
moving the mouse is real it's literally
you know let me try unplugging it
[Music]
just one more thing I did it I did it
everyone I did it
that's just
and this first taste break in the
shotgun
I think the gas can spawn up here
[Music]
might be dead excuse me ma'am just one
more thing get the fuck out here
if I can
this is the lead small version of this
map I think it is yes it's fine
I think I'm okay with that
hello hello oh god help us
Jason's real please help us oh yeah this
is totally not the normal version of
this map
[Music]
two-seaters battery
since Jason's been tunneling vid known
on to me like a motherfucker really
wants my ass I guess
no there's no honor than that all
yeah
[Music]
[Music]
do pigs again sakes let me come in not
by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin
dunno hop home shit
[Music]
all right gasps and keys
anybody know where the gasser keys are
chop them up by the two-seater by the
lodge
if you drop them off
so I don't have to get in from your
corpse
jedd are you worried about the last Jedi
spoilers it was it was mediocre there
you go
spoiled
for cedar has the battery mediocre
and so who died with the gas anybody
nobody shows up on the map now if you
drop it I believe
what's wrong with a four-seater
everyone works swells house if they both
have batteries so you don't want oh I
just got some shots of gas head up to
the forest either
drop the gas nice
tell each rafter
I'm all the way in the southwest with
the keys
watch out he's right there by the
four-seater but so is Jason
[Music]
my bikini
[Music]
who's got the keys who's got the keys oh
[Music]
shit he's
need help a four-seater
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Oh
well I'm going to the earth cops
[Music]
[Music]
alright I'd suggest a kill but I don't
think Columbo has much experience with
this game that would be kind of cruel
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now do you know how to escape let's hope
you know how to escape make a left at
the road follow the main road left or
right at the cross section here
