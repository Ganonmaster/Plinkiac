[A]
yeah oh yeah I mean or else I'll just
buy them all which I you know like I
just need to pace myself I'm gonna run
out of stories and then I'm gonna have
to start buying individual comics and
that's that's when you're addicted just
you know I don't want to be addicted to
comics again maybe I won't read that
issue you loaned me then no you should
it's great fuck am I supposed to go
there saying that's why you need the
dots now I like comics I like comics and
I've been really enjoying the storyline
so looking forward to it I'm trying to
get up there it's not what I'm inclined
oh you know what it was what I was
waiting for the prompt I'm so used to it
I'm so used to it I was waiting for it
haha it's weird they have prompts for
everything in this game except the
platforming yeah it's so weird right
isn't that an awful place to be in worry
we're like you're so you get so it's
Stockholm Syndrome you're so used to the
prompts that when they're not there you
miss them
the game is dark yeah
gritty Irene Hellboy I like I like
someone help like I don't like Oh Albert
I like some help we're gonna get late no
mother it's right here Oh
Richard Scott plug don't worry guys
Richard's got the plug Jebus I got blood
blood blood blood blood I got that blue
oh god this one's comically shortly
comically short I'll deal for now but
when you play oh shit
why do they even call you a knight in
this game do you have a code of honor do
sir you're technically a knight of the
round table yes like a king Arthur
Knight of the round table yes you taking
away feeling power from the Holy Grail
from the Holy Grail and it is very much
Arthurian legend yes only with machine
guns and no armor and laser guns also a
lazy lightning lightning guns and so you
are not you are better respect Tesla in
fact you are Sir Galahad yeah you are
I mean not the sore go ahead you might
be they implied you can live centuries
sure you might be sir go ahead and so
but also of the Knights retake their
master oh that's true so you in any case
you are a knight of the round table you
serve
mother England but you know you're kind
of the superb reinforcers oh yes your
your English night and you're fighting
the stop of revolution yeah this is the
most unamerican game I've ever played
yes because if you beat this game you
are helping the British defeat the
revolution
yes they have gray Lexus and so they are
although they are immortal but they can
still die if they get stuck like if they
just live to their lives that's gonna
one stab you then they would live
forever
they cannot dive through aging some of
them look old they may age slow yes if
someone is calling this a Gears of War
clone they do and war is far too much
going on yeah that's the thing they do a
disservice to Gears of War like just
because something has chest high walls
and the cover system does not make it a
gear of war clock I don't care enough
about what happens to me let's get
through this come on
oh really not more like gears of bore am
i right guys
yes that was good that's a great one
burger oh he said shotgun
yeah shotgun specialist you can do a
rich I believe yeah I believe in you
did you not shoot again right away that
time you can do a rich I believe in you
I believe in rich yeah punch him in the
deck got what he deserves yes
whenever you melee someone I refer to it
as punching someone in the dick because
early on fuck up I got ya
punch him in the deck we be punching
people's dicks in here dick punch
specialist right now I have I'm 100%
sober as we discussed at the beginning
in the stream there is no beer here
which is very upsetting to me as someone
who is hoping to have a gear need to be
here
there is no beer and we're gonna just
gonna have to be okay with that we're
just gonna roll with the punches roll
with it which and I have been playing
this game one o'clock this afternoon
because we you know like everyone we had
heard that it was phenomenally short we
did take a pretty long and break I want
to say we have the seven eight hours and
so far a little bit of fucking around
going on early yeah there's a little bit
of fucking around and we took a break
like we took it's not dinner break and a
chat break home jump in the dick it is
Villa hecka it is and usually there's
beer here but there's
how's the game alphanumeric or
chronological or chronologic this game
is Crohn's disease
it's pooping oh shit punch him in the
dead dick punch
punch him right in the dick this game
looks good really is that a thing that
was sent that's what they're saying and
I agree I agree this game looks good by
mr. Schine smile thanks for coming out
steam page review this game is Crohn's
disease ax is this coming out for steam
is this out on steam I'm looking at dick
punching always saves the day take a
mental note in a tight spot punch a
different ultrafire
this is Laxmi Bai the leader of the
rebellion she is your Confederate have
you taken leave of your senses man I
might ask the same question important
stories that means we do not have time
for this we needed help and she's the
only one I could turn to this is madness
you're putting the very core of our
order in jeopardy I just I said the
order have to trust me you asked that we
find proof she was with me in black war
she witnessed what I found there you
mean to tell me that she helped you
destroy the United India Company Doc's
my father was right that was an act of
pure terrorism
she used you she brought this conspiracy
to my attention this is a news story
the vampire what Spira seeing jack yeah
don't forget about that oh my god there
are vampires in this game she had you
remember when that happened that was
kind of fun we've just been shooting
winces people in standard boring cover
based shooters that's right we shot more
feet we've been shooting more people
oh god no so far I think we've been
playing this game for like seven hours
total something about dick punching
they're all reversed vampires cover my
ass you people just nobody nobody help
me out over there no no no my people
help me out there
did you try punching anyone in the dick
oh here we go
I should have let men die down oh we
gotta get you a better job
you're me I like how your machine and
gun is more effective than your
high-power
you can do it back come back to the
musket we've punched each other in the
genital for hours I would rather play I
would have to play with their name for
that kind of showdown no this is just
the showdown I'd rather play a game
called showdown in whiskey you and
another person shoot each other in the
general for seven hours and whoever gets
shot the most times in the genitals
loses but a game it take turn shoot
another in the genitals that's Ryan
I bought a game what like this with
really realistic graphics I need to see
like blood and intestines coring out of
a general genital wounds no don't call
it western or musical game just felt
showdown that's what I was gonna look up
is this game on Steam no this is only on
PlayStation 4 this is a PlayStation 4
exclusive
let's see if they're going to it's going
anywhere else now play ps4 exclusive so
I don't even know where I can write a
bad review of this game balcony all I
can do is make a make an Internet video
and hope that people don't buy this game
Oh absolute mommy use the grin launcher
so on Wednesday headlines are shocking
get to press a button to press our was
that true and Sniper Elite you can
obliterate a dude's balls with a sniper
bullet and it zooms in on an atom

the fucking shooting gallery there's no
no there's no game your perks and
shooting things ah senior person shooted
things and if you ever are low in house
that found it'll be fine right should we
consider destroying this game all of us
the doors um possibly ha the answer is
possibly everybody
it's a chat love in the game
are we going - we're done as long as it
takes I mean listen no we usually stream
until all the night I know we'll have to
wait and see what chapter we're on I
don't know what chapter room is just
ahead
there's sixteen right there are sixteen
chapters to this game and I don't know
which one we're on some of them are
short cutscene chapters yes
then there's long cutscene chapters it
took 12 years to make 12 years to play
what what is more fun the order or an
AOL trial CD Oh AOL trial CDs you can
like throw those around like frisbees
and those make fun noises you can like
pretend you're Tron and just like throw
those at people shipments uh and AOL
trial CDs you get for free this you have
to pay 60 bucks for I'm gonna search the
archives oh you get to look at more
things let's search the archives nothing
there nothing there keep searching the
archives look for another button to
press good dammit no searching the
archives searching what are we gonna
find in the archives oh oh nope wait
Russell those papers yeah oh yeah absol
oh you folk peanut butter it looks like
peanut butter
there's nothing here he says after he
stole the peanut butter see he just
stole the peanut butter he's getting
that peanut butter search it look at I'm
doing jack I'm searching the drawers
there are exciting things you can do in
a video game you can open a drawer check
how much would you pay for this game now
that you've played it for a while if
this this game feels like a tech demo as
we discussed like the in-game model
viewer right where it's like if this
game was like free to install
to like try out a graphics card I think
I would be fine with that
look look I'm like oh oh I'll say Gusti
the Strad devant something French great
great this is important because but look
by the way shading will go it around
we're going around look at that shading
oh this is important because this is a
thing you can pick up because because
because rich Evans murders homos his
best drawer search simulator effort no I
wouldn't I would not pay any money for
it I cannot be more clear about that I
see you guys throwing down money zero
dollars and by the way I would download
it pay zero dollars but then I would
quickly uninstall it because it would
take up too much space
yeah oh yeah way too much space in the
back of the box 50 gigabytes 50
gigabytes this requires 50 gigabytes
these are shipments that was sent to my
homeland Jesus fuck this leg is to be
believed the company now has a foothold
in every Indian state yeah no skipping
no skipping nose are you trying to skip
the cutscene yeah I just tried okay how
do I get back ah you're pressing buttons
right it made sure I wasn't right back
to where I was yep it says seven six
right great this is written you hear
pressing pressing buttons you cannot
skip the cutscenes and I don't get what
season game that's still smaller than
titanfall they say Jesus Christ how much
space is that take yeah I have no idea
well but that had actual gameplay in it
yeah but it's not multiplayer for a game
with no mo fees exactly this it's so
fucked up
Oh
Oh a vampire Oh a vampire dick punch
them in the vampire dick
do you believe me now monkey is the one
behind all this I would pay zero Zorka
mist for this game yes breed scotch
United India oh you Jacob van neck or as
the Fleet Street pamphleteers have so
fondly named me Jack the Ripper that's
your service
oh I fuckin Carlin I thank you
so Lucan I fucking called the brothers
the brother was the traitor them do not
fail us yeah quite fortuitous I've seen
fucking call their rebel leader capture
this game was written by a shriek a
two-year-old written by a goddamn 15
year old the big business guy is the bad
guy the guy we bit this brother
character this guy that guy right there
look we barely see him the entire game
jack said this what happened hours ago
yes hours ago brother
Oh how did you miss it dragon
don't worry thank you alright alright
it's fine it's fine yeah you know they
wanted some consequences they didn't
make you watch the cutscene again from
the start right that's right you haven't
heard all these creatures
why the fuck are werewolves and vampires
even relevant to the story you're right
because they're not like we barely have
been dealing 90% of this game is dealing
with the rebels who and by the way
shocker of all shockers the rebels are
the good guys
nope not that way this was written by
the writer that wrote that John Adams
miniseries well then he I don't know if
that was any good if it was then he
fucked up this time or was cashing a
paycheck or something this sucks or
there are werewolves it could be at you
they're just our werewolf now
not fast enough
rebels are the bad guys in FTL which
makes FTL fun and interesting
I mean if that doesn't make it a fun of
interesting game but that I really like
that I thought that was a unique thing
because all you ever see is the rebels
are actually the good guys the John
Adams mini series was fucking bastard
well then then this then he was cashing
a paycheck here he might have done good
work once this is not it or it got so
mangled by the development and I gotta
run up a final you earned a trophy
congratulations rich you did that thing
in the game that you were already
supposed to be doing and you're a trophy
for it fucking did it oh don't worry
there's another wearable
yeah trophies that you naturally get
just by doing all trophies are stupid
all trophy once it you get naturally
just by playing the story mode yeah I'm
a dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
the werewolf's are helping the vampires
yes they are working together the
werewolves and the vampires are working
together not very efficiently I'll say
that
oh yeah you got a dick punchin isolate
mutate why are werewolves always in
warehouses warehouses that's really
funny yeah but it's kind of true in this
game in this game by the way that has
been our we took this game very
seriously
yeah very seriously yeah like even like
underworld I see a lot of people
comparing this underworld werewolves and
vampires underworld at least understood
the schlock it was you know women in
skin tight outfits like action sequences
this is trying very desperately to be
stab the dick stab the dick Wolf's Dick
Wolf is that a thing
underworld did have Kate Beckinsale in a
skin-tight outfits second dragon don't
worry just try it yeah doors you try
again she's trying it's fucking try
again it doesn't matter we have a friend
request yeah whatever we're not
answering friend requests right now
please Toulouse offered to make them
immortal wheelchair husband is the Holy
Grail
right
our our our

[B]
no or he just was a werewolf Galahad
stay where you are I said don't move
ladies back and French knight you
arrived in good time we received report
of a disturbance yes I Galahad stormed
in here with a filthy band of rebels
intent on killing me mr. life see the
results of that incursion sir gallant
heads accomplice was a woman there the
leader of the rebellion in fact she
eluded our grasp order you're right
we'll see to the capture of the rebel
leader is he listen to me you're making
a grave mistake possible take this
intruder into custody oh man guys this
is where we could arrest him now we're
at the start of James oh it's very brave
here on out there are consequences to
these characters we saw in the opening
yeah there was is so far we've been
playing has been a flashback there was
an opening sequence in which we escaped
from prison I thank you lady a great
your intervention was truly fortuitous
we are only carrying out our sworn duty
Lord Hastings they're all the same my
lady
you would do well to keep a close eye on
that traitor
one of my dishonor now before the courts
your testimony will be required we're
fun with steampunk fantasy games yeah so
far this has all been flashback by the
way because the first sequence we're
escaping from prison this sucks this
game just sucks
chapter 12 four more four more chapters
we do we can do four more chapters this
this might be a whole chapter right here
sure the person is nine hundred percent
consumed the most heinous crime Sir
Galahad has betrayed our ancient routes
Sir Galahad was a reference not his
enemies he has conspired with godless
rebels they call the characters no this
character is his name is sir gallant to
take the life but they mentioned
something about namesakes they mentioned
something about when a night passes the
night that takes their place also takes
their name but then again the Holy Grail
was also involved so that could be yes
sir go ahead we don't really know yes
that could be the twist there's one of
the Knights of guidance six hundred
years old right perhaps aw now remember
guys say he's the bad guy and once more
put on to the righteous path the knight
commander shows too much leniency
the proof against the traitors what
happens I don't know whacked out like in
the company came back in the same room
okay I was too far away to hear them
clearly but they seemed on their
mustache twirler right the time that
might as well be his name they were
leaving an establishment known to harbor
rebels Galahad sold an audience with the
Lord Chancellor and me yes
six hundred year old they are destroying
every slot trophy ever into this but
they're doing it seriously they're not
having any fun instance that's the
shining this is serious business
is it Lord Hastings you have identified
the prisoner as your assailant what are
they gonna reveal that Lord Hastings
when are they gonna reveal his real name
no I'm done being dead serious
okay I think he's gonna end up being
Dracula and Jesus cry mean I mean yes
they're gonna play it straight yes 100
percent hundred ten percent people hide
out as his commander I tried to dissuade
him from pursuing his allegations
it is now clear he did not heed my
advice oh sorry capacitated sip-n-go is
there an echo in here
yeah we know what happened to begin to
tell me these things we've seen oh he
gets we don't we ends up in prison we
know he's convicted but they're showing
this is trial so they can explain the
things we've already seen
fuck you that's the thing that's the
thing guys we already know he's good
goes to jail we already know this guilty
god fucking damn it tell don't show here
right hometown marker this is a modern
game lots of Technicolor says bring in
sir exposition we know he ended up in
jail if the game started with him in
jail we know they're all going to say
guilty we know this diet well but see
dialogue that says things you already
know is the hallmark of great writing
just let me shoot the vampire the
vampire you know what rich this game
looks when I fight another werewolf a
boring to fight werewolf he knocks you
down and runs away munch town runs away
just keep shooting at him until he dies
because he's back he's out or under way
he's not gonna kill you because he's run
away after dodging that just gives you
get the worm all merchants get die
actually revco says something very funny
do you think that you will win with an
actual Excalibur yes wait well there
hasn't been any sword so far but I've
been predicting Excalibur will show up
at some point yeah I'm pretty sure
Excalibur is going to stab directly oh
sure
in this going Bend with Excalibur
stabbing Dracula and they will play it
straight and for those who don't know
this is a recap of the first thing we
played on the first 45 minutes of the
game this is a quick recap which is one
extended cutscene with the occasional
button prop yes do you think there's a
machine gun called Excalibur barrels
sticking on a rock if by the way if it
was that if that happened a 10 out of 10
a plus game but managed to make it
boring I'll play it so straight it'll be
boring it's okay by the way yeah that
was a whole chapter that entire one
cutscene was a chapter chapter 13 here
we are already great
oh there's there's Tesla that's Nikola
Tesla
he's your weapons guy younger-looking
one we have survived that is for him to
decide I don't know who that other guys
John kilo says no he gets to stab the
Dracula with Excalibur but the Dracula
is eaten by the Loch Ness monster don't
make it boring and do you see guys you
see how we're writing a better game than
this is because like we take it so over
the top that it's funny like good that
it's fun and they're playing it very
seriously this is very serious business
hold on let's see what Tesla's gonna
tell us what's my breath stink nah gives
us the juice the black goo the black goo
that gives us the black holy groan cool
because for some reason the holy grail
creates black goo yeah no no we have
three more chapters left guys three more
chapters we can do this did you want me
to find out do you want to I mean if we
feel like it being my turn Nikola Tesla
wasn't the US and didn't design
conventional weapons what is he doing in
this yeah the first thing Nikola Tesla
does when they introduce him he doesn't
give you some weird electrical device he
had you an i - with a scope on it
because he built he built the scope he
built this go a normal scope he's like
made Nikola Tesla the mad scientist
genius yes who did weird fucking things
with electricity and physics built a
sniper rifle scope yeah for you
an ordinary-looking sniper rifle scope
for you and you said yeah it's pretty
good no it's this is the dumbest guys
that's what I was giving this game a
chance it's my kid good yeah I gave it a
chance I did in my brain you provided
the light it was game cuz I love you
know I love some of the art designs and
the costumes and everything looks
beautiful and I think this kind of
modern semi
modernized steampunk knights of the
round table that's a cool idea if they
just let themselves have fun with it
yes which fun they did not I've heard
that about games that sometimes they can
be fun
this needs some shock yeah this needs
some schlump full-on schlock well let's
cut scene II stuff more schlock more
sock 20% more schlock bump it up to 40%
more slacking you got yourself the
makings that would this is a whole
bottle and this has been habit we have
not touched the controller from like
that we have not touched the controller
in quite some time the whole trial I
wasn't in control of anything yep this
is a game people this is eggs game I
think I don't think I touched the
controller for all of chapter 12 yep
you've been in and out of consciousness
for almost a fortnight a fortnight is
like a week two weeks is it yeah
people what you hear and so my health
well you can play go on oh I'm gonna go
to I mean I guess I don't think I'll
have to I'm just I'll just sit here I'll
just sit here and watch the boring thing
happen I thought you would appreciate
them fortnight equals two weeks thank
you for for confirming
things are happening now it's true
this is the newest genre of gaming
background games and says the hell fast
Domus I'm really sorry for torturing you
guys but let's go oh wait I think I get
to move now I might get to move now oh
we're in the mix that was a whole nother
traffi that was two full chapters of
nothing but cutscenes congratulations
the order
you suck harder you suck the hardest oh
wait I have to
I play inverted still with like a
controller and Rich's move - okay here
we go this way slay we're going where we
got our gun this way that was a chapter
right you guys saw that right that was
an actual goddamn chapter
this game is meant for having out in the
background and setting the mood
okay I'm playing now Oh to the face next
time I'm gonna shoot you in the dick
oh shut you in a dick we went through
another chapter of nothing but cutscene
I have a gun again and I don't really
know what I'm doing I really like this
guy neck I'm gonna hold on to this sauce
more guards are coming down the left
tunnel how many chapters are actually
being played about five oh if that boom
we're just doing something much more fun
he's playing don't shit your pants
these guns I don't want that gun I like
my revolver I like my revolver so you
can't believe rejection right it was a
shock to us all you sit around and drink
wine with your goth friends in every
twenty minutes you play the game for two
minutes yeah he was coming this like a
mood enhancer and I like that
I can't apparently I can't be in cover
anymore they don't like me I'm covered
did I do that on accident Greg oh shit
why can't I get in cover that's really
annoying why not you can't I had a lamp
section earlier no but I'm saying that
doesn't make any sense no I couldn't get
into cover or use anything other than
pistol yeah all right he can't he's
incapable of putting the line to dog to
take cover
yeah used to had a weapon briefly sure
entities are capable we're doing it okay
calling a cutscene a chapter is fucking
cheap doing it twice in a row is
unforgivable uh yeah yeah I'm with you
I'm absolutely with you chapter 11
creative bankruptcy oh here we go I'm
not taking credit for any of these
things I've been saying I am reading the
chat yeah all right guys we're good
we're getting on we're getting on with
the game we're doing it getting on
getting on we are beating this game
tonight not like it's hard it's just
time consuming yeah no no I was Mike we
we had to pay for this game yeah we
don't have any weird deal with anybody
for reviews no me we had to go to the
store today and we paid for this yep
thanks in part to all of our wonderful
subscribers thank you all this is where
your money went
we very much appreciate it what no this
would make my kids play this game when
they know you didn't do your homework
that's huge
you have to play two chapters man I hope
it's a cutscene chapter no but you hold
the controller like you wanna play my
witness is she good I thought she was
such a shirt please don't lump it ah
jeez for blood she's out for blood of
interest yeah she feels scorned this is
the horror house we saw boobies here
early it was great
it's super great like there's a little
bit little shooting section and
obviously anyone who's ever played a
shooting game saw that it was not a
challenge and you know now we don't need
to worry about touching a controller
again from this is we are in another
cutscene I shot six guys in a hallway
this was made by a frustrated film well
then he was frustrated for a reason cuz
he sucks at it of course he's got to do
it alone if I live to see why I bring
the lady who has an army of helpers with
you when you can just do it alone trope
that's what let's put a trope on top of
our fine
flowers are you a turncoat or a patriot
what would you have me be Maki Oh
believe you have a reason for what you
do this is our friend two revolutions
have taught Lafayette that there are
dangers on both sides huh forget this
monkey see that you do not Monsieur
should you threaten the cause of Liberty
you can count on Lafayette to be your
sworn enemy this is the French night
bitch considering the history of England
was in France that is will my friend
weird you know there are werewolves and
vampires in here apparently so I'm not
gonna worry too much about like the fact
that there's a French knight of the
round table horrible that's fine that's
fine you should you shoot a lightning
gun this is a weird world the third day
of December 1886 leaving us so soon
almost all mrs. turncoat or Patriot
neither I am dick and puncher explain to
you
puncher what do i what do I smell here I
smell some dicks about to get launched
what does catchphrase
yeah and then he also says what right
before okay great I got all my guns back
now great get to Teslas lab oh maybe we
can get another weapon 15 is that was a
new chapter I don't know if somebody
said 15 almost there
oh my god oh my god I I did not take out
my weapon right there guys did you see
me take out my weapon cuz I did not
press a button the game took out my
weapon for me thank you game cuz I
didn't want to decide when to do that
probably supposed to shoot this guy
other 15 or 16 chapters there are 16
chapters according to game facts we
looked it up to see how far we were
before we screamed Nikola come in I mean
the catacombs on my way to you stay put
I'll be there shortly
you shut up Nikola I'm coming good thing
I walked down that hallway so we can get
to this other cutscene
which happens burgers hobo sews there's
actually one hundred and sixteen
chapters chef
shut the damn face oh I shot him in the
hand and people in the hand know killing
people earlier by shooting them in the
hand it was pretty great yeah it was
pretty great okay guns do you have no I
don't want that shit gun what kind of
goods do I have I got my badass revolver
I'm a badass okay yeah I don't need any
oh and by the way like you know how we
were talking about earlier how we were
choosing not to Crouch the game Crouch
for us I am not pressing down the Run
button the game says you have to run now
really really I'm sure even you're not
even clicking down on the the stick no
but I'm just pushing forward as I
normally do you kidding me
the game says no you should run now this
is this is a fast-paced section you
should probably run now your fucking kid
not even joking
the exciting conclusion they have to
make sure yeah because nothing else is
better right
shit shit another guy is talking with
the game developers on tree read these
game developers I would love to talk to
these game developers I want to know
what house I want to know how I would
love to talk to these guys absolutely
that's a fucking lutely
so far we look at it like look at this
just more fish in a barrel
what's the game here guys cuz cuz you
know what I do I just sit here I guess I
you know what I guess at one point I
might run out of bullets so we got that
going for us just sit here wait for them
to stick your heads up my guess is this
is precisely the game that Sony wanted
and at this I'm gonna say this was them
following orders Sony wanted an
exclusive well somebody did somebody
start off trying to make like a shorter
telltale type game I don't know Mike you
know the people who made the Walking
Dead game sure kind of thing that's just
an interactive story that was shorter
and then Sony saw some potential in the
art designs and then gave them money
sitting on my shirt all those yeah
exactly
I mean you've gotta be it's gotta be
longer yeah I make sure driver does that
what happened I can't I want my gun I
don't want these stupid guns sir Lucan
the Lincoln
damnit I gonna die
I'm gonna run away - no more so I'm
gonna pick up a different gun I didn't I
was hoping that like there'd be ammo
over here oh wait you know what though
I remember the III hype yeah and I don't
think we were wrong about anything
what is the hype for this game what's
the big deal I don't get it
yeah and I still oh okay great
I got some ammo for my nice big gun now
Oh rich I wasn't talking about the devs
of this thing we're talking about the
devs do stuff like binding of issac yes
sure we'd love to
oh gee mr. right absolutely
abso-fucking-lutely we had such a great
time talking with the dev of strafe well
your Tom yeah when we apply when we were
playing strafe and talking with with Tom
I had a I I just wanted to listen to him
talk so if I get to like if I if we had
time to prepare and actually like ask
people insightful questions instead of
just farting around with them I would
fucking love that completely
ill-prepared yeah but you know what I
still I still thought it was a great
time yeah and whether it be a game that
we don't much care for like this or a
game that I love like Binding of Isaac
uh I would love that
mate yeah anyone who into who knows how
to make that happen you go ahead and
make that happen
vegetal Jack it's James
ID Oh James yeah he'll know I can hook
you guys up fucking yeah you want to
talk to Ed for me you do it
because he's the guy that made the
videos for binding of issac so he knows
oh I already have all the ammo for that
he knows Edmund McMillen great
so I already have all of these ammos
just a better gun you tell me that's
what I'm trying to figure that out
this seems to have
it looks bigger than one you have now oh
this one there's more power this one I
think is called a dragon oh do I want
the Lightning gun might want a lightning
cuz you're cold
right this is this is the right they're
arming you for the final bit here so you
pick your weapon I think yeah it's like
I want this stock machine gun cuz it's
usually the best plenty of bombs I
should just take this one because it has
more bullets it's fine it's my thought
no this one is the most bullets okay
great
your jack cry about is lost save for
that poor developer oh my god
if you can get me if you can get me on
the phone with Tyrone to be like what
the fuck man I lost my golden God save
on my Vita no that's fine
I got I'm getting over it shit you know
what uh what's we're running out of time
unless we end up fighting right
just opportunity if they don't do that
all the way into trophy


[C - 01h00m to 01h10m]
oh shit oh shit sneak him back look at
that guy
firing at me yeah and hitting a goddamn
thing make my thing
chip Excalibur will be the DLC maybe
maybe the game will be the dlc dlc the
gameplay dlc ah I can't damn it they are
saving Excalibur for the sequel there
will not be a sequel this right down
there it holds six bullets 12 bullets
well that can't be worth it sorry sorry
man you should be this holds 40 I'm
gonna say this is better all right
this is gonna talk to Edwin and Tyrone
this week and he'll they'll ping us if
you can we you know we're just a couple
of jackasses how's my ex does throw a
grenade jack don't waste your time with
these jokes you're right you're right as
Mike you're absolutely right how do I
throw a grenade again I only have 100 it
might be the smoke one now it might be
the explosive moment that's a smoke
grenade down is down is the real grade
okay you have to kill an Excalibur
wielding the hit murder the sequel oh my
god that'll be great
Neville didn't have the spear of destiny
right
it was the spear that's supposedly stand
Jesus on the cross
oh right
look at that look at that I'm gonna
shoot him in the elbow such a family you
probably couldn't shoot into those right
remember when I was I was taking like
fancy gatekeeping
giant holes yeah and it was protecting
me from the machine gunfire I do
remember that that was great that was
great I have super slo-mo mode and I'm
not using it not good cover
I saw that here James says would you
guys still be interested in talking to
Edmund or Tyrone if I was drunk on the
call that might be my only condition I
mean I just want to talk to you about
video stuff too so I get you know I
guess the answer is absolutely whatever
man
you come on we'll talk to any whatever
gets done whatever gets it done we'll
talk to people we don't we don't give a
fuck man you think we give a fuck and I
am not killing it I am not killing it
okay okay here we go
throw a grenade this is a grenade trying
again
kids see no you're shooting in the
special mode that's fine I'm just doing
using the odd I know it's auto targeting
but at least put the camera somewhere
where you can see what you're shooting
at the fuck's safe every night for
fuck's sake
survivin yeah how the fuck did you
survive that watch me have as long as
you do so we can get this shit over with
right
let me says fifty bucks says there is no
boss fight after this shitty gauntlet
the game will just end with twenty
minutes of cutscenes what les says
saying don't think see the common I like
it I write really read the comment first
because that helps oh sure
oh that's right this has like easy in
and out of cover oh you can use roll
over the next one your big blank to your
left
oh there's almost armored fucks brave
got it okay
where is it
they say oh this is the yeah this is the
n boss fight by the way this is like all
the weapons that we've been all the
weapons that we've been using throughout
the game are being used on us now
Gaddis me shooting flame it
look at this
that fuck call that flight huh they call
flanked yeah
hey you have a special visual oh great
oh I might have done it look at all
those guns on the ground
that wasn't that was that you know what
that was like that was a challenge
obviously still very boring because
there was not a lot I could do besides
just wait and cover for cover but you
know fuck it I'll take it I'll take it
if that's what I get I'll fucking take
it
I would love some more ammo for the guns
that I like now but I'm probably not
gonna get that em I know mr. glitch once
we are finished we are not going to go
back and play the chapters we played
before you guys got here
just the electric alright
does this recharge I don't know probably
not so this is the electro gun oh yeah
this is like infinitely recharging this
is the gun to have no use six of one
oh yeah yeah look at your mo this is six
of one
oh I was just looking at the bars in the
bottom well fuck it whatever take this
I'm sure they're gonna drop more guns
one presumes there's been a save there's
been at what yeah a save your red leader
than anyone I know you're trying to tell
us what the final boss of the game is
but we'll find out yeah no need to spoil
that for us
seems like a pretty shitty gun on the
whole does it automatically at least
target people yeah it does last shot
with it
just porn it sure did sure did rich okay
I got this one who red leader 91 just
think this is thinking for subscribing
we haven't been able do we haven't been
saying who subscribed but I'm gonna say
it now for you
red later wait yeah he's got a feature
okay red leader 91 thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
it's true we very much do we very very
much appreciate it
sorry well fuck you
we are streaming from a ps4 right now so
we don't have a pee


[C - 01h10m to 01h20m]
of our subscriber notification red
leader 91 says but it's the most
disappointing in reference I think to
the boss battle the whole fucking games
one giant disappointment what does it
matter how awful the last boss is right
have you not been listening to our
overall disappointment indeed with the
entire game there's no handguns over
here I guess I don't really eat pizza
train I'll take your word for pizza try
an 11 thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it
oh no sir losses kidnappings Nikola
Tesla oh not love interest no love
interest is trying to fight us okay do
you think we're gonna we're gonna we're
gonna happen
and it's gonna be the heart-wrenching
thing this game wants to be art really
so we're gonna have to murder her so we
can stab Dracula with Excalibur damn I
am laughing because I know you're right
look at this gameplay Oh mad civil
opening action Bunga ugh
bong Oh Doug Banga Doug Banga Banga Doug
like a bond like a bonbon
yeah like bump on my months and then
then God like the thing that doesn't
exist huh and followed by unlike a
caveman would say no Banga Banga dog
bond good
did you say if Nikola Tesla I saved
Nikola Tesla oh hey hey look at this
chapter 16 huh chapter 16 this is it
guys I have a gun I've never ever seen
before
I don't think we're gonna fight Dracula
I knew you would return brother
come out of the shadows it's getting so
real guys prepare for the realness we
are not that different I do what I must
to protect my kind that's a lie
God exists rich this game is proof that
he has forsaken us says my turns are
green whose name also ironically the
sword fight oh my god is this gonna hand
over the crease an event of course the
course unless
I swear
nope I'm not super familiar
that's a wearable oh yeah this is just
like earlier oh yeah this happened
before so they couldn't be bothered to
come up with something new
it's like insult on top
second try again this exact same boss
might happen like ten chapters ago revco
77 I think you're right he expects your
resolution to Dracula I think he's right
they're gonna leave us in a fucking same
everyone's gonna want to buy the sequel
to this game jesus fucking christ if
they do that they deserve
special no special load on this guy
before I did
I'm pressing I'm stamina haha yes
Vaughn ganda oh my hand why we want to
bet face her face I said oh I should
have punched another dick what was I
thinking big puncher very
this exact same fucking fight happy yeah
I know there's a thing on the ground
that you hit him with
it's kind of neat though not really very
interactive no oh I didn't do it that's
fake faker active no it's it's it's this
is awful
QuickTime event the game I did it
excellent Dabba
steppum in the dick I'm gonna punch you
in the dick so fucking I should have
punched into the dick right I'm so upset
that I didn't punch a good thing this
fight would have been over yeah I'm
gonna call that his dick this is
Wolfgang wolf yeah oh and now his lady
lady's gonna see this she's gonna see
this aftermath I've seen things I am
condemned to remember civilizations born
and destroyed
humanity's incessant greed pride
altering each other apparently yes
coming out everybody right your father
was it all a lie I love them as my own
blood love interest Dracula
no no here it is my son
forgive me


[C - 01h20m to 01h30m]


[D - 01h30m to 01h35m]
all right
we're leaving the credits play so we all
know who to blame for this game oh I'm
waiting for the additional cutscene we
love interest is I'm going to get my
revenge I'm going team up with the wolf
men to get revenge on Sir Galahad you
you didn't know it but all this time
I've been she she takes off her clothes
and you see like we must recruit like
mommy yes say the Creature from the
Black Lagoon
we must recruit The Creature from the
Black Lagoon
I want you to meet my biological father
the Bigfoots
Thank You Sony
it will dictate your size me it will end
on a slow slow zoom in on the brother
and its allies it okay no we're not
gonna worry we're not gonna play
anything else tonight just cuz it's late
and I just know there's no I can't I
can't
you think we could actually enjoy
ourselves right now no no we're done
we're done with this game
with all games weird I'm done playing
games this is this for anyone who has
ever confused as to why rich and I'm
like in a game so I I may have broken
our copy of FIFA no mind that might have
happened
not not deliberately mind you know I
just I just we will here is what I
promise you viewers of the stream the
end of our previously recorded the order
will feature a spectacular destruction
of the best destruction I possibly can
our original idea was to buy it at 1:00
in the afternoon try to play it and
finish it before being
yeah so we can return at the same day
that was going to be I thought by the
way that would be a pretty good thing
yeah but this game is so bad that
and we are gonna find a way to do that
just for you
exactly it becames cut $20 and give me a
thousand hours of gameplay this cost six
for six hours and what are you gonna do
replay this what was that
who's that name was no Bob no body right
oh no body it's a clever spelling nobody
nobody
yeah you guys should do it soon while
the game is silver relevant yes we will
we will expedite this production
six minutes not six hours no no I
suppose technically speaking I want to
say we got maybe eight hours worth of
gameplay eight nine I mean you're
including cutscenes nine eight nine
hours that's how long it took us to be
the game eight nine hours I don't know
how we're gonna do well find a way we
will find a really fun way
liquid nitrogen plus hammer right liquid
nitrogen might numb the pain I don't
know that that a DVD can feel pain but
just in case there will be no numbing
agents you know we could take it to the
gun range again yeah now and use a lot
bigger guns
cuz that gun range was really fun in
this direction
- I want a gooey puppet
I don't know James like


[D - 01h35m to 01h43m42s]
you know
so I just talk shop with you know what
you use your like especially like your
rebirth trailer was just so fucked up he
was beautiful
yeah gun range plus button prompt
homemade flames or we might do that
oh you're right it doesn't need to have
something to do with electricity because
Tesla's in the game so is Dracula in the
Wolfman
you guys you guys know Jay and I have
not gone to his ooby's lately I did go
to a really great place I went to Toki
which is a restaurant on the north side
of Milwaukee and they do ramen they do
like fan-fucking-tastic ramen it was a
great night
ah okay we're leaving no I was thinking
I'm gonna wait for the fucking credit
wait for the credit register stuff
fucking rolling credits um Jack the
Ripper was Dracula right he never called
himself Dracula well yes we should of
course we should do prereq reviews more
often they take time we're working on
we're trying to find her flow still
times we get busy with other stuff space
cop other work yeah happens there was
there was too long of a break I'll tell
you yeah this is not worth your time
even if someone gave you this game for
free you just trade it in see if you can
get a co since somebody else might buy
it I'm saying like let's say I'm taking
a grandma grandmas around she doesn't
know grandma doesn't yeah one trying to
get grandma's money back and if you
can't get grandma's money back then see
if you can I don't know maybe you can
make like a bird feeder out of the out
of the box
I don't know this is unforgivable yeah
you
you know I don't want to miss is someone
saying I should pick someone in the
credits too big punch but you know some
of these people might have been like
artists on the game and we all agree
that the game looks very good yeah yeah
if I see if I write her if I saw the
writer right I think I saw the writers
name but it was a long name so I do
I don't know whoever wrote this game
dick punch deserves upon multiple well
no no no we shouldn't wish harm on
anyone else right let's let's be clear
about that I do not want you to punch
this writer in the dick other thing is
if this writer got punched in the dick
I wouldn't necessarily feel bad but I
don't want it to happen the writer
deserves it just for the ending no the
lead developers I know deserves it for
deciding that a game that is 70%
cutscenes is a fine thing
there's a fine acceptable thing to sit
there and hit X occasionally when
prompted to write he also deserves
multiple dick punches you know I don't
want to I don't want to say we should
physically harm someone from making
something I'm just saying if it were to
happen if you know who made this game
and they live in your area I urge you to
go punch them in the dick to take it
upon yourself maybe oh this may be don't
punch a minute exceed you take justice
for the world and punch these people in
the dick see if you can distract them
while they are walking towards something
that's dick height so they accidentally
run into it therefore you're not
assaulting someone but they still get
hit in the dick can we do that
yeah shotgun specialist everything is
art every game is art this is art
absolutely no that's alright you can let
them call me a pussy you don't need to
delete that comment I'm trying to be
real here
Thank You mods for for deleting it for
deleting that comment but now you know
it's fine if he wants to call me a pussy
for saying you shouldn't punch someone
in the big rich Evans encourages
insulting game developers yes yes I do
can't can't I just can't what I would
like to encourage is public shaming of
the people who made this game and dick
punching shame and dick punch to bits
dick punch specialist:what bored looks
fun somebody's asking if we're gonna
play but one more and blood-borne was
the one that was made by the yeah by the
Dark Souls Dark Souls guy that looks fun
Oh
Jesus Christ I can't believe these
credits are this long
thanos 388 says quote from lead designer
I think story and visuals are very high
gameplay is something that it's a game
we make big games we can't get around it
were you trying to get around
sounds like they may have been they were
trying to get around the game what the
fuck is this what are we crediting now
these credits are still happening I know
they are oh we've heard the trophy guys
we did it
we did it
they make CGI movies do they what if
they made do they suck sure they suck
this sucked alright here it is it's over
no I'm God good god you're good God

pop up on the screen once again what
says would you like to end scream we
just ring to encourage we don't want to
encourage anyone punching anyone in the
dick but you know see what you can do I
