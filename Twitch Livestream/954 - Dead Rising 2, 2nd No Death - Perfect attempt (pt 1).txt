[A] I don't know I don't know man
how's everyone doing how's how's
everybody doing today I'm tired I'm
doing this anyway what I'm tired I was
originally my original plan was to do
this at about 12:30 meeting more risk
than realistically one today but nature
decided to dump a fuckload of snow on my
head last night so uh yeah it sucked
sorry new game
what's wrong with the camp Oh
yeah there we go there's a cam random
random red stream oh I can't wait Clyde
perk up fuckin fuckin snow it won't stop
it won't stop sighs snowed what five
times this week snow day today it's I'm
gonna be focused on the game because I'm
I'm trying to do this absolutely
perfectly like I want to get Katy I
definitely intend to get like if I fail
to get the best ending if I fail a main
story quests I'm gonna consider this
done so that's that's first priority and
to all the main story shit second
priority save all of the people all of
the people that I can save there's some
you can third I don't I don't I don't I
don't know about this one though
complete all of the like survivor
request like after you save somebody
evil they'll come to you later
I need this to that and then you got to
go get them Lister that
the fuck Stuart I was kind of a freak
thing last time Stuart dying all right
nobody's gonna care or remember this
last last my last no death run attempt
Stuart one of the survivors died and I
claimed that I put a little stay here
marker down on the ground so he would
stay in a safe spot while I went to get
him a health item instead he followed me
I went back I looked at the footage and
I do look down at the ground because I
remember doing it I looked down to the
ground and I hit the button to put the
stay there marker down but just I think
coincidentally at the same time I hit
that button a different character joined
join my little group join my party and
that message popped up and I think that
cancelled out my little my little stay
there marker as I see where I look down
I remember doing it I wasn't an idiot
like Stuart Stuart slow inhale stay here
where it's safe Stuart I remember going
to do that
how's the volume on everything is the
volume on everything good is that rising
to about family very much so actually
voice volume good what about what about
game volume I kind of want the game
volume to be well I'm a little bit mom
what am i not love a game volume to be a
bit higher because it's so low stream we
don't always talk about much would you
ever tried Dead Rising 3 on here
yeah maybe I tried Dead Rising 3 and I
got about halfway through it and I just
don't care to finish it feels nothing
like a dead rising Dave the people who
made Dead Rising 3 obviously hated Dead
Rising 1 & 2 and they just started
throwing out things I liked about the
first two
right time to almost literally mow down
zombies screw you Leon
you see me play this before you know
what's going on I'm getting points for
killing the zombies with the balloons
attached to them it's not really
competitive in this little early
single-player sequence but originally
this is a whole multiplayer component of
the game but I don't think anybody plays
this anymore online multiplayer and I
never really did anyway because I'm not
a multiplayer game like I played dead
rising for the single-player experience
so I don't I don't think you can enjoy
any of the multiplayer games anymore
that rising three just became a bit too
simple for me Dead Rising 3 they thought
the focus of the series was killing
zombies like obviously you kill a lot of
zombies but they focused on the
shallowest thing
goofy weapons got the weapons just kill
zombies forever that's nice for time
waster in these games it's fun but
there's so much more to Dead Rising 1 &
2
Capcom laid off about 50 people from the
studio responsible for Dead Rising 2 3 &
4
well yeah there Capcom's probably done
with them now since dead rising 4 tanked
that's that's not shocking at all you
you can expect to hear about them
closing soon after well they'll probably
have them make like some kind of cheap
game like Mega Man Kinect though they'll
shit out something stupid and that won't
sell well either and that'll be the last
thing they do and they will be quietly
closed down
Capcom Vancouver
they actually rained in the scope for
the next Dead Rising game what are you
talking about and what do you mean by
rained in the scope there was some kind
of leak though the there was a kid there
was some gonna leak for what they were
going to do with Dead Rising 5 it
actually all sounds very promising but
here's the thing the league was an
anonymous source on 4chan it means that
that's that's nothing you can't you
can't say well they're doing it they're
definitely doing it it's that's some
sketchy evidence to go on it could be a
legit leak or it could be just some
asshole
how did I die the first time umm I
fucked up on slappy slappy kicked my ass
and he really shouldn't I expect to
dominate slappy this time absolutely
dominate
God Chuck you you you move so slow
compared to level 50 Frank West and Dead
Rising 1 I talked to all the people I
mean I don't really need to talk to
these people this is doing nothing for
me to have this conversation with this
this attractive yet evil woman but in
the racing jacket hurts your eyes well
get used to it I'm not putting on a
silly outfit
goodnight
this game is way easier than the first
but I feel like it's more polished
gameplay-wise
was a lot of Polish in the first game
Dead Rising one has so many details not
saying - doesn't - they they did improve
the path finding of the survivors but
it's like the zombies almost never grab
them and it doesn't it doesn't feel like
they have personalities at least not the
way they behave in game Dead Rising one
you would get you against survivors who
were terrified and because they were
terrified they were much harder to
escort
and I want to note that the reason I
don't mind the difficult survivor
escorts in Dead Rising 1 is because
unlike a lot of escort missions in video
games the Dead Rising at least no one
and two well the ones that still had
escort missions they were 100% optional
and you did not get a game over if the
person you're escorting got away
sure waste of my time and I do it any
differently like normally in a game when
you're escorting somebody and they die
and you get a game over that sucks
but Dead Rising 1 they just die and you
keep playing
I have not beat the third-level
in slave the spire I haven't gotten past
the second is this for real
like for real for real no you're
daydreaming Dead Rising rewarded you for
a successful escort most games punishing
for an unsuccessful escort that is very
true that is that is very that is an
excellent way to put that now who said
that who said that who said that
yonder yonder yonder Your Honor that is
fine point
now check out the server
which is pleased with you younger
younger yeah that you under you under
put it very they phrase it perfectly
that's exactly that's exactly what Dead
Rising one did and to but just to a
lesser degree because I know I know
Stuart died last time I tried playing
this was a flu for the most part the
escorts in this are all easier
these are zombies these are infected
look if if you don't bleed to death
after your arm got ripped off because
your heart's not beating and you're not
even really bleeding yeah you're zombie
I don't care if you became a zombie
because of an infection or not but these
are zombies
it's my foot twitching because I'm on
too much I think my foot is twitching
because it's related to my constant need
to fidget and I can
I can't fidget right now so my foots
fidgeting this is what I think is going
on
thought they were mutant wasps that's
what causes the the zombie-ism you
become a zombie because of a parasitic
wasp yes though the third game still
thinks there's a virus I third games
just so dumb
by the way how fucking ridiculous is
case West case west for anybody does
know is the DLC that followed up Dead
Rising 2 and I've never played it for
when it came out on the the xbox360
and I had Dead Rising 2 on the
PlayStation 3 because by that point I
had realized the xbox360 Hardware was
utter garbage and case West the big
gimmick was we're bringing back Frank
West but you can't play as some single
player yeah you can only play as Frank
West co-op and that that killed it for
me right there because I had no
interesting co-op
I had five red rings of death no shit
you are right about the 360 I had three
or maybe it was four and when I had
repaired and then a red ringed again I
no luck with the fucking 360 hardware
and the other reason I kept one you know
I had to have a working one just for
Dead Rising really Dead Rising and the
xbox 360 version of Ninja Gaiden 2 which
had the blood which is what you want out
of Ninja Gaiden 2
just take care of your 360 you moron oh
fuck off now that the hardware was bad
you could take care of a 360 and would
still fuck out you'd still tell you to
fire God it's still red ring it wasn't a
matter of taking care of it it was in a
well ventilated area I bought like a fan
to put underneath it No
Krauss platformers ran on three spinner
on 360 and ps3 usually yeah unless the
360 was red ringed it wasn't working
it was it was better to get the
cross-platform games on the ps3
but should you ever play state of decay
yes I have I liked it though I have
something's missing state of decay feels
like I or yes state of decay
feels like a prototype for a game that
they that they that they intend to flesh
out more but what's there is good
rikta every time I stream this game I
get 50 comments about Dead Rising 2
off-the-record which I'm familiar with I
it's okay I'll say this once I'm gonna
say this is the stream so I don't know
get a hack bot ready for it or something
Dead Rising 2 off the record is fine
it's the beginning of the degradation of
Frank West character though that's when
Capcom thought the character was just
some kind of meme spouting joke so it's
it's nice to get JT rotolo back to voice
Frank West but the character is turning
into a self parody by the time you get
to off-the-record but otherwise it's
fine
what's going on
all right for the for anybody who asked
in the future about Dead Rising off the
record I'm gonna pretend I've never
heard of it okay I'm just gonna I'm just
gonna completely lie and say what what
is that never heard of it in fact I'm
gonna pretend they're making it up just
for fun
trying to roll those seven for the bonus
points
on the one there we go
those up modding modding Frank West's
into dead rising 2 off the record yo
there is four dead rising off the record
there's a mod actually heaven that
imports the Dead Rising 1 Frank West
character model into Dead Rising 2 off
the record that's gonna need how long is
this run take typically a while more
than four a lot more than four probably
looking in look if I don't fuck
something up I'm looking at 10 hours or
more
it's my opinion on time gated games like
Dead Rising I love this series so
obviously I have no issue with it
one hell will sit through I better order
more food well say if I die look this is
a no death run if I die or fuck up the
main story I'm gonna put that on me too
I need I need to finish the main story
then I'm then I'm just done
then it streams over is this the pc
version yes so I am getting what I
assumed was a much better framerate I
know I played I haven't played the the
console version of Dead Rising 2 in a
real long time but I played a few months
ago really couple months Dead Rising 2
case 0 on stream and that was the only
place that's available is on the 360 and
it stood out to me how choppy that is
nice tramp Denise you're getting it
you're gonna crowbar stop take this take
a crowbar alright let's go let's go
Denise you got this
I got orange juice
do a few bad apples make the rlm fanbase
look bad that's that's every fanbase
isn't it oh I don't have a jump kick yet
all right well if you watched my other
attempt at this you know you know where
I'm going and what I'm doing right now
Denise can you just can you just go go
to the places I need you to go there you
go
I may need to pick up another weapon
pickaxe out and doing a pit pinch
wiill cherry I probably could have
grabbed a wheelchair for you can put the
survivor in a wheelchair and then you
can both move faster that way
it's nothing really good if you only got
like one survivor with you maybe I'll
try that with the niece next time live
in Chicago burbs and was repeating your
snow rent in my head the whole time I
was digging myself out of my ting myself
out of my ting myself out of my ting
myself

[B] a driveway today yes yes anybody who
thinks that Oh a hot summer or a hundred
degrees in humid Oh
thinks that's worse you've never had to
dig your car out of a foot of snow and
then chisel ice off of the windshield
all all when it's like 12 degrees
outside and your fingers are numb even
though you're wearing gloves because
it's that fucking cold when it's a
hundred degrees and muggy I can just
walk into the car and turn the air
conditioner on it takes the air
conditioner while the cool the car down
but it also takes the heater a while to
keep the car up in the winter so I still
say if you if you're if you're living in
and the fucking ice and cold that's
worst man it's worse
I think the the high the high
temperature last week was 1616 it's
inhuman if I played Dead Island
I've I think I've played a little bit of
it once first-person melee is just weird
what's my thoughts in state of decay uh
watch the stream 15 minutes ago it's
fine I can't I can't keep repeating
myself no one wants to hear me just
repeat myself constant Denise nope don't
fight the tiger Denise you stay over
there
oh it's head I'm so glad you're easy
Denis is a pretty ballsy chick she's
terrified of hoodie wearing looters but
she'll take on a fucking tiger
I don't have failed my first attempt uh
I done slappy I don't know why I don't
know how boss shouldn't be that hard I
made a much harder than he should have
been
all right snowball
let's do this yep let's take one down
say okay for anybody who did not watch
the last attempt at this and there's no
idea what the fuck I'm doing you can
save the tiger if I feed the tiger
stakes and get his health up he will
become my friend
and I'm trying to save everyone and gosh
darn it I think the tiger counts
died
eat the steak snowflake eat the steak
zip this is a
there I moved too much it distracts her
from eating well I guess I got to keep
the zombies off my ass man snowflake is
the most competent party member you'll
have in this game that is 100% true
someday and now is now is not the time
but someday I need to try and bring
snowflake to a psychopath fight that
would be awesome
you don't need an apple you're fine
just didn't Oh
snowflake
bring snowflake with to the magicians
fight oh my god oh my god just like a
real-life Siegfried and Roy that would
that would just be tasteless I'll have
to do it someday if you if you don't
know who Siegfried and Roy were they
were famous famous magicians and
famously they worked with white tigers
rare white tigers were part of their act
and they they retired after one of the
tigers literally tore out one of their
throats they survived somehow but they
they very nearly died after getting
mauled by a tiger who tried to terrors
throw it out so someday I'm gonna need
to bring snowflake with during the
magician's fight
it's a long time to keep snowflake alive
I know I know it is but that would be
awesome and you know it
damn Denise you're getting you're gonna
caught up a lot
that's unusual Dead Rising 2 behavior I
don't I don't disapprove I'm just saying
it's unusual
why are you running on the the track
that moves the other way you people you
crazy people
I didn't realize so many people hated
Chuck Greene's Jaken I don't I don't
mind this jacket it's this jacket is the
closest this man has to a personality
never seen Denise get caught up so much
this is weird they did they did catch
this to make it more challenging
weird Denise is just having an off day
very much so
that's fine yeah we go I need to pick
something up drive another I got a
stupid Apple that's somethin
this marbles and I'll take a horsey
stick yeah we're set
stick to me
we've entered the quiet portion of the
stream I'm sorry
all right Lonnie were yet we got money
hurry up Lenny get into range Lenny move
too slow Lenny
you know what happens if you come back
without with the Zombrex but without any
survivors of the dialogues any different
like do I never get that cutscene if I
never save anyone
that's an interesting question can you
miss survivors yeah but dealing with the
timer that's part of what's fun about
this game today
survivors are at certain places at
certain times Dead Rising 3 they think
the survivors pop up like the four of
them pop up with the story missions and
so yeah I like this little clockwork
world
nothing like the stress of realizing you
might miss one of them yeah actually yes
look if if missing a survivor meant
failing this story it might be
irritating but it doesn't they're side
missions the game is meant to be
replayed until you perfected no I meant
that it's a good thing okay
it's because of those presents and the
survivors we're already up to level
seven so not bad not bad having to find
Zombrex all the time was kind of tedious
yeah once you know once you know where
to find it
it's not that bad also you're in a
casino finding money isn't that hard so
it's also pretty easy to buy it from the
pawn shops
yes phone I know it's time for Katie's
on books
Wow
Gordon can do better yeah possibly
it's kind of cowardly I don't know if
chicks dig that
so he's pushing the elephant through the
ventilation system yes yes
wish right I sang 14 says I wish they
actually made a cutscene that showed
Sullivan opening the vents and the tiger
coming out followed by the logical blind
panic that would ensue mouse Chuck
calmly tries to explain that he tamed it
with three snakes after killing its
mentally retarded handler you win with
that common
we've been framed for John P zombie
genocide we've been framed this is the
OJ Simpson game we're off to find the
real killer which is funny because the
real killer is kind of the OJ Simpson
has character
there's an O Jay Simpson game that big
that B if I'm using concept a game but
you play as OJ Simpson trying to find
the real killer
some nice sarcasm does anyone considered
the zombies or misunderstood has anyone
tried to talk to them so what's
bothering them there's a survivor later
in this game who brings up that point
what am i grabbing that axe I don't
really need that axe
Oh Jay Simpsons follows the clues and
they all lead back to him all right now
we're gonna make silly goofy combo
weapons that ended up ruining this
series in the long run so they're kind
of okay in this one because they're not
too over-the-top
there's my commentary on the combo
weapons of the series
Jeff it's it's an infection that makes
the Dead come back to life they're still
zombies and I don't know if you can
consider a parasitic as a parasitic wasp
is that still considered an infection if
you're a girl you know you're infested
with a parasite is that the same thing
can you be infected with a parasite I
don't know I don't know enough Bob
proper definition of infected we're
gonna we're gonna get technical
yeah
all right do something I didn't do last
time and I think this ultimately is
gonna help me level up faster which is
good cost me a little bit of time but I
think I'll be worth
oh no run wait wrong wait right into the
crowd tighten it right into the nope
nope nope nope nope nope nope fucking
this up so bad
where's he at you're not by the other
ones get the group I'm fucking well
takes what we get
no blow that was good
no the spike the spike bat honestly
again zombies should be less efficient
because the spikes are only gonna help
help it get caught into the zombies
flesh and you're gonna buy that when
you're when you're busy yanking the back
out of their flesh are gonna be bit by
other zombies so I think the spike bat
would actually make the weapon worse you
just want a normal baseball bat
shut my favorite animator my favorite
anime character is fuck you kids stop
bothering me

[C] are you serious
Goku is the one with a sword right don't
they all have swords
can't hear the game I need to turn the
audio up on the game
Goku is the one who could totally beat
up Superman well it's really easy to
have a character and you just say those
characters were powerful and it's really
easy to write that doesn't make him a
better character though I just invented
a character called jerk man
who's twice as strong as Goku so he
could totally beat up Goku at a fight
jerk man's better
all right straight let's turn some audio
up
like I like Superman as a character but
even though he could totally beat up
spider-man I like spider-man more so
like which character could beat up who I
don't I don't give a shit
DBC is well DBZ is one of the few animes
I watched start-to-finish
isn't Dragon Ball Z literally the same
thing over and over and over and over
again this character is stronger than
Goku Goku needs to get more powerful
they stare at each other for eight
episodes they have a fight Goku wins
here's this new character he's totally
more powerful than Goku Goku 'he's got
to get stronger goku gets stronger they
spent eight episodes literally just
staring at each other
goku wins there's this new character
there's go new characters totally
stronger than goku goku 'he's got to get
stronger they spent eight episodes
staring at each other
goku wins
when I first discovered Dragon Ball Z
they used to air that on the Cartoon
Network's I watched it for a while and
it was it wasn't like I'm enjoying this
it was more just
slack-jawed amazement like how many
episodes in a row are these characters
going to stare at each other I was
flabbergasted
don't beg away you're running right
through the middle of the Horde I demand
to know Rebecca Rebecca Chang of action
9 News
close the fucking doors I know this is a
shitty weapon but it's right here it's
right fucking here
don't bother
I like riches opinions on things but he
would make a terrible president well our
current president makes a terrible
president and just because he's
incompetent it's not because like I hey
right winger I just know just Trump just
seems like an idiot man
gotta grab the book I need that later
it's like that flashlight
did the story mission now we're gonna
now we're gonna go rescue some people
that should talk anime again I don't
care - should talk anime I don't care if
people like anime this this doesn't
bother me it's annoying when people
insist I should like it but I don't
really care what other people like and I
was I was shit talking Goku not really
anime in general really to be to be fair
alright she will only come with you if
you find her hubby I'm pretty sure he
spawns anyway if you don't talk to her
first but why risk it it's like she's
right out the door once I do the story
mission with Rebecca Chang
inventory space goes so quickly so
quickly yes NPCs get infinite ammo
though I've noticed if you give them
shotguns in this game not not in Dead
Rising 1 Dead Rising 1 you always want
to give them shotguns if they can take a
shotgun
I'm Dead Rising 2 it seems like they can
do damage to other survivors or at the
very least knock them down which is
aggravating
right come on jab let's go rescue your
wife let's drop this ATM machine first
though
fuckin zombies
that's it
what what vice does rich have cheese
you take this Doris oh yeah doors take
the chocolate first there you go
no no you don't go and put on a hat
anymore take it there you go there you
go
if you get caught by a zombie when he
was busy laughing that's that's actually
kind of funny
now Chad I am a teetotaler I don't not
I'm not preachy about it just just my
own personal choice but I don't drink I
don't smoke don't do drugs
Duras
yeah there you go Doris nobody's shotgun
on the zombies you stay there I'm gonna
take care of business 100% sure if we're
ahead or behind unscheduled but yeah
whatever it's fine got some things we
need to do climb in no I can't climb
that
oh no I don't want to throw that
now pick up the three
there we go there we go
Lord
look at that expert crowd maneuvering
alright a to my own fucking horn
fall down here I'm probably gonna lose
time well I will lose time that'll be
really annoying
I kind of hate this part oh god damn it
see that wasted like a minute
yeah one more I think two more two more
and this is the easy jump got it I
really care about that I care about this
free Zombrex anybody who worries about
Katy giving Katie zemerik's their free
ones hidden round that is one of them
are they there right now
hmm
no because I want her with me when I get
the kids I could get them now
I could save Stuart now but I kind of
need a female survivor with me when I go
to save the the Nerds
I should stay the course
move it stay right there
yeah they made straight to the Internet
movies for Dead Rising I don't I don't
know that they're any good they heard on
crackle which is some kind of thing that
does streaming I tried watching the one
of them once there were so many
advertisement ever ads it was just
infuriating every every minute you got
five minutes worth of ads it was on it
was unwatchable
okay I'll find I'll find time for tips
at some point but hard to do that while
I'm playing
see the zombies slip and fall on the
gumballs it's a cute touch
does she count as a female for the Nerds
I haven't tried possibly I don't think
they've spawned in yet so I can't I
can't test that god Esther your
conversation is long
just Richard tonight yeah just me this
is this is a non streaming night bonus
stream I just felt like doing Dead
Rising 2 it's what I were in the mood
for
stick with me
normally I would get my shotguns back
from my survivors before we get to the
safehouse but there the shotguns aren't
as useful in Dead Rising 2 as they are
in Dead Rising 1
sted rising three or four any good not
really
three isn't the worst thing ever made
but it does suck

[D] nice yes you leave your daughter in the
same room as a tiger it's silly but as I
said before that's that's kind of an
easter egg more than an accurate
representation of the tone of the story
in this game that's fine
always a little bit of time doing this
yeah
yes I did give the tiger to my daughter
as a present
careful never changes clothes and
60-plus hours yeah a lot of the outfits
are just silly it's a waste of time I
don't mind I don't mind the default
outfit
by the way the the occasional zombie
that actually starts running at you is
is really kind of freaky what none of
the other ones do it
I'm not sure other than our other than
killing a looter and getting one I'm not
sure of a great spot in this game to
find a flashlight which is kind of like
right now
I know one spawns in one of the
maintenance rooms I just I don't
remember which one and I'm not sure how
out of the way it is what are my
thoughts on Dead Rising 3 they stripped
almost everything that was unique about
the franchise out of it in order to
appeal to a larger audience and it's
stupid and it's easy and it gets boring
shortly it's not that bad I'm making it
sound worse than it probably really is
but it's so crap compared to the other
two Dead Rising Games
don't
Oh how about that how about that right
here
up
I'm sure you guys will love this
yes you tape some gems on to a
flashlight
and you get a lightsaber
changes color a little bit randomly when
you switch back and forth between it
oh is that the only choice baseball if
I'm gonna look at the poster for the
Lambo
it's something with it what I need to
hold on weapons have durability in this
for fuck's sake
I'm not sure what kind of damage the
lightsaber does on bosses I kind of
think the machete taped to a broom
handle does decent damage so I'm gonna
hold on to that basically I'm worried
about the upcoming Brandon fight cuz
that's gonna eat up a lot of my time
when do I read tips when Adam won't get
around to it
it's a solo stream this is a different
beast I'm glad you took for zooming
attempting alright I'll read them at
some point just not not consistently all
night this this stream would last
forever if I did that
Changez outfit already there's nothing
else like it worth it isn't just stupid
see that's the lightsabers dangerous I'm
gonna more damage on him than I am
anything else you have to admit it Dead
Rising 2 has a much better lightsaber
battles than Dead Rising 1 there's the
thing there is a lightsaber in Dead
Rising 1 if you get the 5 day survivor
you survive for five days in infinite
mode it unlocks a lightsaber that spawns
in the security room you can pick up a
new one whenever you go to the security
room
you're getting too aggressive grandpa
stay right there
all right all right they're not doing
Tibet doing stupid things
wait there
we're doing good now once moving at a
good clip
faster
you go there stay over there
still there follow me
next it might be the hardest escort in
the whole game
that's not that bad
that flashlight is not very durable
isn't that right so this way
judge did you really give up on
discovery yes
I don't know why that should be so
shocking if you're not particularly
enjoying something don't keep doing it
I don't think the magazines help with
the combo weapon durability z' though
right
we're doing okay
really
I know big stress done before game
oh that's a good experience that's for
that my laser source already broken I'm
not taking it I can use this though
let's bless 500 points yes
durability spot durability is crap
alright it's fine
let's say forgive that guy some food
so they're very unlucky him there you
sevenish
why are you following me here
well damn it all right I didn't work out
it's not gonna be a perfect run
you fucking kicked his ass rich no he
got hit by a zombie from behind you have
to beat up a little bit to get to talk
to uh to recruit him to ours that's
now that's a lot of backtracking
still there
stay right there I told them to stay
behind I don't know why the game ignored
that command that's irritating you know
I want to reach I want to restart but
it's too fucking late
it's it's too fucking late
come on stay close
hurry okay
fuck
you wait there sorry your husband's dead
the wine
hey you okay
this is boss fight I'm worried about
we're late enough I'm not restarting by
the way if I die this is it playing for
nearly two hours that's that's a lot
I've got to go back and do stuff again
so did he in effect himself
not quite he's got that girl tied up
down there for a reason though
to the reefer about his voice
no stop
he was not doing as much damage as I
would like
yeah this weapon don't suck balls that's
what I got I was thinking it would do
more damage there ended up doing ya know
and I'm briefly caught in a loop
oh okay it does do decent damage if I
use the heavier attack

[E] we're reading too much of the chat
probably I'm paying too much attention
to you assholes man you're slowing me
down
tasty ones not active yet ah fuck fuck
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck fuck fuck
I'm thinking
I'm thinking
I'm thinking I've got like 48 minutes in
the game in game before the next mission
starts and I'm wondering if I have time
to save anybody else just to catch up on
my time a bit or if I should wait around
so I don't miss the next story mission
ah maddening maddening I'll grab some
bears I think grabbing bears is the
smart thing to do
I can I can I can save the Nerds once I
do the branded mission so I don't only
I'm that far behind on time because it's
kind of on the way I think we're doing
good I think well I think we're doing ok
but no matter what I can't I can't miss
out on case two one I was like I said
I'm if I miss out on the main story I'm
I'm considering that that's as good as a
death for me I'll be restarting or well
I'll be ending the stream really
yeah I'm gonna be honest with you I
actually don't know where the skateboard
is in this and I've played this a lot
like at 7 p.m. zombies
all right
fucking do the hard way
nope nope nope alright I'm about to give
up on this bear a huge time investment
on this bear though or Bowl I guess
technically Teddy bull doesn't have the
same ring to it
wait why is the arrow pointing me that
way didn't fuck something up did I why
is the arrow telling me to go here I
don't know
oh there's somebody to go to brains over
brawn ok ok you know it's actually
really hard to see you around this bear
some bringing these bag is actually a
little bit challenging Mike I'm gonna
keep calling it a bear because this is
stuff Dan'l like a big teddy bear I
don't care I don't care this is a bull
all right I make it just in time for the
case
then I can steer this run back on track
king Vidya that's a pun
that's pun can I skip cutscenes to save
time not to save in-game time I don't
think that would actually work it could
save your time but yeah I don't skip
cutscenes that's jacks thing
what
be careful okay
what's the ratio of in-game time to real
time ie oh I used to know I don't
remember I think it's like well I'm Dead
Rising one I think it's was it 10
minutes to 15 minutes to 1 hour no no no
that's insane I don't I don't remember I
don't remember I remember an infinite
mode it took 20 minutes for your life to
deplete but I don't I think I was about
two hours ten minutes an hour but I
don't really remember
that's Dead Rising 1 not Dead Rising 2
two hours is one day in infinite mode
and that's that's Dead Rising 1 I don't
I don't know if it's if they could
jiggered with the time ratio for 2 or
not
all right
now we'll do brains over brawn diet
inventory space okay I've got a little
bit of inventory space I'm gonna make
myself another quick step that will be
useful oh wait that's mine
I shouldn't be wasting time with this I
am
I've already started wasting time on
building the ie D so I might as well
finish
escape there you heck I don't know where
the fucking skateboard is I know that's
bizarre I know
I memorized every weapon combo no just
ones that use a lot
I don't know if messing around that idea
that's getting me enough experience to
be to be worth the time it takes to do
that and there's huge number of points
what good are bear you give gifts to
your daughter and that gives you
experience point it's something else
that helps me up helps me level up
faster plus it's another one of the side
objectives I'd like to complete in order
to do a perfect run
what I do say these two people who are
trapped in the burning room then we're
gonna detour over get the Nerds come
back do Brandon then I'm gonna bring all
those people back do the Lian fight and
then we're going with the story mission
like a fucking gazelle gracefully
maneuvering through the zombies
fire extinguisher I know there's one
around here somewhere there should be
better fucking be shit
did I drop something important over here
yep I did I'm gonna whop that gonna want
my laser sword totally not a lightsaber
absolutely not a lightsaber
wait there shotgun and we're fuckin
around to get it
like a fucking baseball bat
alright you take that let's just go
let's go everybody come on you nerds
okay okay
everyone's here and ones here
ah
come on come on come on that way that
way Go Go
whoo so I'm not talking much this is
this is a concentration time
alright I'm gonna have them wait there
while I do the big obnoxious boss fight
health rich I know I got the I got the
quickstep in my hand I'm waiting to the
last possible second so I got as much
quick step as possible for the brand in
fight wish there was an option to talk
him down this there's some bosses in
these games you can save Paul and the
first one technically speaking snowflake
the tiger in this one there's another
boss in this one you could save - who's
a human being this is the first
psychopath he fought me kicked your ass
yeah Brandon is not meant to be tackled
your first time well I saved the boss
that savable is I'm trying to save
everyone I could save in this so yes
just after me nope
why so I already got me down that low
and help oh this guy sucks
oh this fight I hate this character
oh my Chris step we're off this bad
Oh
that is not easy for the further record
eating trash off the floor hey those
chips were in a bag
psychos and this one are much harder
tell Cletus man I know I'm low on health
I'm running straight to food so we'll be
good we should be good
let's go
Dadda my why you nerd nerd nerd
oh well
still there keep close

[F] the guide you read said to use the
painkiller mix to make the brand in
fight here look I didn't do it I was I
wasn't able to pull it off but if you're
fast
I can I can get him stuck in an infinite
loop where he does the spin attack and
he rest for a second after the spin
attack but I I just failed at dodging
the spin attack he dodged his spin
attack you can get a free hit on him
basically then I'll do the spin attack
again so you keep dodging the spin
attack and you know what he's gonna do
he just keep it going until he's dead
daddy do you need to go back up
oh no wait I want to do
that's a lot of leveling up
rich isn't worth your time to get the
bonus xp for mileage magazines fuck ya
so I got it I got it in my inventory
right now I'm gonna I'm gonna carry that
fucking thing around with me like all
fuckin game pretty much
yeah
how did this serie go wrong this series
go wrong the people who made this three
and four hated the series that's how it
went wrong and people who bitched about
who will do whatever I want even though
they already could do whatever they want
I'm Roarke an explorer but I can't
ignore the time or even though you can't
ignore the time or if I won't ignore the
time oh I don't know even though I want
to do so make the game dumber to appease
me it's something I'm bitter about I
know I'm bitter about a lot of things
that is definitely one of the things I'm
bitter about
all right see if I managed to fuck this
fight up
every dead bison feels the same if you
think that you're kind of a moron and
then you're probably just trolling me
with that coming
whatever buddy
I used to follow you when you did
motocross but look at you now you're a
broken man you just don't got it anymore
do you what's your problem you're such a
chump Chuck
that wasn't a zombie yeah no shit shucks
twice the points harder to hit cuz they
move around so much
all right really part of this fight is
very important I need to not fuck up
this is one of the easier bus look I'm
trying to kill him fast I know you can
choose him by trying to get him stuck in
a corner
I fucked it up fucked it up big time I
can take off a shitload of his health on
the way to where we're going but I
fucked it up
let's go
is he
and may have to go to chew stress
this is why I brought a machine gun
yeah the early portion of that fight you
see every time you knock into him you
take off health you just kind of ride a
little bit behind but alongside of them
and all the way when he rides down the
strip to that area
you just keep bumping into him and as
health goes down a lot but I fucked it
up I got too far forward and I got hit
by his chainsaw
all right health might be an issue
I would like more health time is also an
issue though now dear now dear oh me oh
my
there's still no looters
I'm going on my way to get food I don't
I don't want to die here you'll
recognize this as the spot where I died
in my last attempt right there I think
pretty much exactly right here
first now if I drink any more alcohol
I'm gonna start throwing up but I think
I'm good
Slappy's gonna end this run to slap he's
not gonna end this run
I would never call the prequels watch
both the prequels are the opposite of
watchable they have the glass shard
nearly ended this run he's honestly one
of the harder bosses in the game
especially if you you're still you know
if you're not very levelled yet
I would have used the dodge roll I don't
believe I have it yet
thanks for the ride
that I hate Buffy durability mechanics
mr. Nath's it makes the game what was
his plan there on the guy in the
motorbike I have no idea
hope for the best was his plan
No
like the machine guns are so shitty the
throwing palettes at me instead of
shooting at me
that's how shit these machine guns are
no no nope I got it now oh just barely
some people bitch about weapon
durability and Zelda breath of the wild
yet without it the game balance is
ruined
yes yes I will say I wouldn't mind
weapons having a touch more durability
and Zeldin breath of the wild like 20%
more but yeah the game is built around
it
Oh
gotta hurry up gotta hurry up
it's controller aiming OMG yeah I know
it's crap but that's that's controller
without auto aim for you no more I can't
you can't switch back and forth but yes
there is look for everything in this
game other than the shooting I'm
comfortable using a controller
now if I could have the mouse in one
hand and aim with the other that'll be
something but I don't believe I can do
that in this one you can do that in the
PC port of Dead Rising one this is lime
streaming at our off day why not
you get a Wesley Snipes vibe from the
bad guy in this yeah yeah it looks like
a buff Wesley Snipes
Oh plan Lea plan my route out here where
am I going next what are you what are
you
oh that's the that can wait that's
that's the pawn shop I have to go there
to unlock the pawn shops and I just
don't care enough right now all right I
need to get here I'm all the way over
there
ah should work
left
look at that old guy it's true I'm old
all right
don't need an objective marker I can
just fucking drive their fucking what
it's still quick
interesting
whether the person who just died
III can't save them so we're still
perfect
weapons for you I probably should have
held on to that gun
live and learn huh live and learn
I'm gonna try something new which
probably isn't a good idea but we're
gonna try something no guarantee this
will work not at all I want to put down
oh yeah I got the super motor on my hand
don't need that paddle Saw Massacre time
it's fine you can you can hold out in
your own fur bit right
this is a bad idea if it might be this
might be the worst idea ever
it's gonna be the best worst idea I have
ever had
alright alright Sven I'm gonna need you
to stay somewhere safe you're gonna
you're gonna hang out in there for a bit
I'm gonna take this murder machine over
here though
Oh oh no this is
