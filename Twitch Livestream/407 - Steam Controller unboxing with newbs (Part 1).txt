[Rich and Jack are playing video games]

Jack: These are the greatest games. "Portal" is a great game. 

Rich: It's fine.

Jack: Huh? 

Rich: It's fine. 

Jack: It's a great game. "Portal" is a great game. I, I, you know, there's a lot of hyperbole...

Rich: No, I like a lot of 'em.

Jack: ...a lot of exaggeration, and, and game criticism. But "Portal" is great games.

Rich: How, how quickly would "Portal" get without GLaDOS? 

Jack: It, it doesn't matter. It's, that's a moot point. She's in there. And, you know what, I, I'll tell ya I didn't...with, uh, Wheatley, I did not like Wheatley as much as GLaDOS.

Rich: Oh, Wheatley's great!

Jack: Eh, I didn't like him as much.

Rich: Or Watley? 

Jack: Or whatever. I also, uh, you know what, uh, though, uh, though I love J.K. Simmons, Cave Johnson just didn't do it for me. 

[Rich gives Jack a surprised look] 

Jack: Yeah. Yeah. I'm just straight up, putting that out there.

[Rich sets his controller down and walks out of the room]

Jack: I'm not saying he was bad. I'm not saying that, uh, I'm not saying that, like, he took away from the game, but...it just got old. His whole schtick just got old. Just, it, it got old, you know? Like, that's kind of the thing that J.K. Simmons does, or di,d and, uh...in a lot of stuff, you know, I just didn't...didn't, uh, didn't feel as fresh. GLaDOS...didn't feel as, GLaDOS was a nice enemy. I'm not saying it was bad. Just didn't...didn't like it as much as GLaDOS .
