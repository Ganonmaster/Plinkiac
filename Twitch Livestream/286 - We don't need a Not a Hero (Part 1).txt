[A] it totally looks like a jack game but I
wanted to play it and Jack's not here so
I'm gonna play called not a hero
and I've only played this game a little
bit I've since reset it so here we go
there's money anivia is mine alright so
that was bunny Lord it was a purple
bunny man if I had a song called purple
rabbit I would have played that instead
but I don't the Rising Sun thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
alright so obviously there are a bunch
of unlockable characters but the only
one we have right now I believe canvas
they emerge week whatever angle all
right the echo is is totally minor and
acceptable okay and we're gonna deal
with it for now
all right let's take a deep bag to move
easy enough and the a button does some
slighty stuff and this is a 2d
side-scrolling pixel art cover based
shooter as you can see he's in shadow
behind that that cabinet that's he's in
cover so this is a cover as the shooting
game with reloading and everything and
he says I'm using things as your shoot
people it's not terribly challenging so
far especially with the regenerating
health I'm assuming most of the
challenge is going to come in time doing
it quick and keep things down wrong
right

tutorial tutorial is done get it off the
window was taken thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
