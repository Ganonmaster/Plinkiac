[Jack spectates, as Rich plays MGS:V as Venom Snake]

Jack: But, anyway...

[Rich mounts a horse, and leans sideways off the saddle as the horse trots]

Rich: I...hate this thing, that would work...

Jack: Are you just gonna try to walk right past him like that? Is it gonna work?

Rich: We'll see. I could regret this.

[The horse trots past two unsuspecting mercenaries on a mountain trailhead]

Jack: Oh, get down! Get, what are you doing?

Rich: I went to hit "X", to gallop...

Jack: Don't gallop! 

Rich: ...when he got off.

Jack: Just, hey. Casual, casual.

[The sound of Venom Snake's horse alerts the mercenaries, but their line-of-sight misses the horse completely]

Rich: Just a casual horse. Casual horse! Casual horse! Don't mind me. 

Jack: I think they noticed you. Can you get on the other side now? Are they--

Rich: Casual horse! 

Jack: Wait, are they coming back for you?

Rich: Nope!

Jack: They're going away?! Fuck you, that worked...

Rich: Yeah.

Jack: Just, just a casual horse going for a casual midnight stroll. "Don't even worry about me, man!"

Rich: How about that stealth?

Jack: Whoo! That AI, Rich.

Rich: Gotta love it. 

Jack: That AI is something special, right there.
