you must be my contacts no one who fears
reprisal would make an entrance like
that let's get him on our team
he will okay once you beat this mission
he goes on your team nice he's a heavy
with decent aim it won't take long for
them to all's I'm missing especially
since I've got this thing we got a thing
if you take me with you
it's all yours that's our man
and it looks like Oh catch with them
we'll need to get him back to the
extraction point in one piece there's
former employers not to mention slow and
steady sitting overwatch and you have a
squad sight sniper I'm gonna hang back
that's right so the three things to keep
in mind that's right
large boy
Roger that
or men
we got this you gotta keep the chatter
of bridge alright somebody on that other
side I'm top two probably and that's
saying that's the guy you're escorting
I'm not sure so careful ahem what he was
taking office from a variety of bidis
regardless of their intentions you can
switch her to the pistol and do
overwatch remember it all right I
remember I remember all right all right
another thing to keep in mind
fuck-you medkits that's kind of how
we're playing this I use a med kit when
I have a good support and I have a good
medic to use because it's just the one
use it's one use some before you got
decent armor you die quick anyway I'm
not gonna kill somebody just so they can
beat him finish off the next term we
think dying in one shot yeah when you
die in one shot red kits are like hey
whatever
no this is something less base-catalyzed
Thanks
hot dogs ahead
you can't get a decent night's rest
isn't present but I've come the future
oh my god yep okay
oh all right hey tripper this fuck
behind us oh wait wait stop looking
consider because when they drop down
from the sky yeah they're on overwatch
so if you move right they're gonna get
he's gonna shoot at your ass right for
some reason I can't shoot at him cuz
you're down below you can't see him oh
you know once I had the wrong person
there we go this is the one I want
what's wait I'm just looking okay is
this what's 75% a five percenter that's
pretty good
it was everyone else got anybody else
got peed on you might be able to hit him
40 that's not good you might be able to
hit him just out of tree huh he's a
witness he with grenade within grenade
range I'm sure he is maybe with this
lady cuz I would destroy his cover at
least then take a step down pretty low
now um yeah after that
just because he is right next to know
now what's her chance to hit that that
one is in the back like oh cool all
right you're right you're right
I'm just if you can get your rookie
skills sure they break up okay that's I
mean you know that's something to keep
in mind you still got that that I said
last night yeah yeah
and when you're in close ranges so
another another thing to know about the
weapons yeah when you're actually close
range to the sniper rifles accuracy
decreases Oh
so since he's only got one hit point you
might have a better chance to hit with
the pistol okay that is good to know
yeah that is a good hint 100% chance
okay great
I hope that today oh well I built I
believe it's a trilby might be fedora
okay slow and steady slow and steady you
might um you might want to take a turn
just to there's no time limit if you
just want to reload sure
reload get everybody freshened up we
doing on everybody yeah oh yeah not
everyone can move this turn anyway yeah
exactly
okay alright slow things slow and steady
gonna be very exciting back in a mo a
job itself
okay slow and steady rich has gone away
and so it's just me now just me talking
to you guys I'm gonna do my best to get
up on a rooftop to see if I can just
piss rich off all of it because I think
that would be funny
once I saw this device I began to fear
the implications of our involvement
heading to that location
overwatching language this is the most
exciting okay here we go
I got a second check out the chat I know
I'm working on getting the entire team
killed before which gets back
oh no I got up on the roof there is no
ruff I'm a mystery
seriously though do we have any nasty
surprises nothing okay
just nothing we're just taking it slow
also if you're going over March with a
sniper don't forget to switch back to
the sniper rifle yes okay good good that
way move Zhang in here and then we take
just fine you move behind Zhang just
nice and easy
it's amazing and then our sniper can
just hang out because she's got a perch
right because she can see everything
everyone else sees ah yeah yeah if
you're gonna move everybody though
either move everybody over to the side
your snipers on remove your sniper to
the side everybody's on sure is that
squad sights useless if she doesn't have
a line of sight anybody your squad sees
alright so I pick a side to bring
everybody down on okay well they're here
for now then I move everyone to this
side okay okay okay let's overwatch
everyone will she'll see she's still in
the pistol yeah she got SWAT sight with
the pistol the sniper when you go
overwatch trying to use the sniper rifle
but you can't overwatch with the sniper
rifle can you get oh wow you can't move
and shoot you can overwatch with a
sniper rifle
oh okay that's another one
get ready enemy forces
okay he's on overwatch
and most um almost
all right okay Oh get get to it
oh we're going already was he he was a
nun over watch they Oh whenever they
drop their on overwash oh okay
Wow shit what's well check it always
check what everybody has sure so you
know what kind of odds you're dealing
with before us she's not got the sniper
rifle out though oh my goodness never
rifle off I'll see what happen on 39 so
close he is anyone oh I can definitely
kill him thanks got nothing
she's out in the open and we gotta get
me just gotta love her we can't miss the
overwatch all right renamed or shoot
Renee it won't move children well you go
kill hell yeah I am
yeah that's pretty good
fifty really tornado kill him
yep yeah
I try to no I don't want to blow up that
back wall cause I'll fry need that later
now the throwing animation is really
funny okay so that's his turn so now
let's see if the rookie here
I know mutation is not a rookie and that
a rookie dang
and see if we can chip away some help
careful if you my friend overwatch I
forgot for a second over watch and I
remember I remember
and I shouldn't run over flank they
would be
let's just see what we can do here okay
only one bullet left though I'll get
reload after this okay
really let's check it one bit oh yeah
that's the cool down on this
unhitch shot oh you probably don't need
it though for health sniper rifle those
high with damage than you so much uh
yeah let's give this a try I can always
have some third grenade if the sniper
rifle there we go you're still in
business I still have all my people take
tick turn everybody a drink reload
everybody oh yeah might take it two
turns but it's worth it absolutely
that's you reloaded I'd like to see Jett
playing FTO it's it's kind of like this
it's kind of boring but I really love
FTL good job asshole
boom yeah somebody said that for you or
for me
I don't know I'm suing for you since
you've got everybody dead I got
everybody dead yeah I'm so he said good
job jack they didn't say asshole okay
and you're still good alright
retreat now what's hectically that's
exactly what we're trying to do we're
heading towards an exit and there now I
can hear you well neither this nor FTL
are boring to watch for me at least oh
that's good XCOM is super exciting to me
great work rich that was all Jack my
coaching is on a minimum right now yeah
Rick who's just giving me some pointers
and telling me tell me what now when I
didn't have the right things okay yeah
we can all four watch your Snipes watch
hostile forces about a tower position
XCOM is the gaming equivalent of soccer
make it forever
oh oh oh my god well this is over
watching yeah Jesus Christ you fucked
that guy up well well shit guys
nope oh that's alright that's alright
just one guy what's your sleeper guy
that's one guy snipers got enough that I
can't imagine oh we gotta get well so
one site
I mean if she had a clear line of sight
Tim doesn't matter how far away he is if
somebody else could see it oh yeah yeah
I just just tryin to I already move you
yeah I already move doing so you are
gonna hunker they're gonna overwatch
probably gonna poison you poison me thin
mints spit poison I know this sure
Oh what sir what's her ability to hit
that guy oh yeah
oh but now now is my sniper now do I
have a line of sight
well it's this something's probably
blocking the snipers sure was the
problem sure what else one of those
headstones or something they might guess
the over Watchers cases he should decide
to move but right the saying I would
just keep yeah thanks Emily and hunkered
yeah and they're not movin I can't say
hunker down and have J get upset yeah
that's so sad
all right let's see what he is
please yep all right and so what does
that mean that for every he's gonna lose
like three points of health all said and
done one to each turn sure okay
and has also is aim and whatnot is
reduced okay well does that mean for you
was this it was that like a
philosophical question what does it mean
you're right does that mean for you guy
you can nade him uh you can grenade them
be careful you don't wanna hurt through
the smoke though oh yeah
see I like a missile you could I don't
know if I could Grenada I don't know if
I could hit him with a grenade no
probably not from them but I can missile
um maybe this is your cult shot is blind
no I can't even that's only I might move
around Marsh what happens I know there's
a lot of tombstones on the way usually
the shots blocked it just turns out
yellow like that and nearby like I
should be able to hit that and he's
going I think says 0% though okay move
off a bit not avoid up what is yeah see
here is like 90% I don't know you got to
just find a sweet spot where there's no
tombstones on the way I saw it go 91 so
I'll just fucking tombstones
should I try more of the right of him oh
no no no okay yeah yeah and I don't like
it I don't like using my lorac Oh what's
ninety percent you can miss with the
rocket launcher it pisses you off every
time it happens but it can happen
alright maybe if I move her if I just
move her like over here it's never yeah
I mean just why not
it won't hurt yes Oh all right we can't
move and shoot huh you can't move and
shoot that's all right all right no okay
that's not a bad suggestion
I'd get out of the smoke and all maybe
hunker down again yeah we can go over
here now the smoke over here
hunker overwatch is the clunker okay all
right
he's in half cover and that's a thin man
he's a sitting duck
all right give me a second here I think
I can figure this out take your time
it's your turn base okay yeah yeah I
know rich Evans is the man inside of me
here stream is falling off
listen I I know that 90% is not a
hundred percent but it's 90 fucking
percent yep
you know you know what you know what X
I'm advancing but I thought that's X
coming baby yeah that's ex-convict
that's probably a chance to say that
that's ex-con baby yeah
I'm just gonna wait he's gonna move up I
think everybody's bored that's fine you
getting bored okay so you can be one of
us
I'm sorry what we're very sorry but this
warplane Ricky's gonna Ritchie's gonna
try a tap dancing routine what the fuck
was that right seconds lessons just bang
your hands on the table
right absolutely okay all right
oh wait no no no no no there we go
60 offseason Stacia
thank you we'll give it a shot if not I
can great
I'm sorry that's my alright alright
that's fine then now that won't kill him
grade no he's got for help the grade
only takes up three that's alright we're
gonna grenade him you shoot him with
somebody else I think like my plan if we
grenade him that'll get rid of all of
his cover yeah and then and then this
guy should be able to do something
poison so his aim is low I suppose you
run up with her yeah yeah I've heard of
it but as a secondary but lemon green
okay right first I'll definitely grenade
first yeah we're gonna grenade him first
all right this little rocket mister the
rocket rich that's bullshit God odd
mutation taking it to him boom I've
mutation that occupation job thank you
now what can fearful sludge boy do
sludge boy yeah he might be able to see
all right everybody take five are you
you're fine that's uh oh you're good
it's hang here good
you can pull with uh someone high cover
on the other side of her that tombstone
on the left and left
oh yeah okay I'm with you I'm with you
I'm rolling I'm rolling out rolling all
right
you up ever so slightly really nice
feature okay great so thin man but we
got it we got it now we got a Jimmy Jam
guys that's a mutant a mutant yep want
the fizzy fuck where's my sniper hey how
are you doing you're doing fine that is
a new time all right you know we're
gonna do we're gonna hang we're gonna
reload yep we're just gonna we're just
gonna be over here you don't even need
to worry about us do you have good cover
so you're just gonna overwatch you
should reload they're gonna keep your
head oh tell me he's exposed he's on the
the flanking side of where that creature
might decide to come from
oh Jesus Christ rich you're right let's
get overwatch and you might get lucky if
I put her here I can overwatch her over
here well no because you want her to hit
him when he comes out I mean right
all right I put her closer to him and
all right area let's see what happens do
you have anyone else who I got
okay yeah we got one grenade over there
she doesn't have line of sight though
nope that's bad that's okay we can we
can fix it
we can try um we can try and move in
there you know see if you guys line of
sight here or here but we're not gonna
worry about that right now
yeah we're not gonna worry about that
right now we are going to what are we
gonna do okay I can figure this out
I can totally fine I won't let you
figure it out you let me figure this out
oh we got good cover over there but we
need to keep them we need to keep zhuang
alive this is somewhat accurate
statement rich plays Jack playing X come
and do event I'm sorry jack I hope I'm
not ruining this for you with big too
much of an armchair comes I'm not I'm
meant to lightly coach oh that worked 1%
but now I can't fire her
that's fine you know next time you'll be
able to that's a good thing
ya know riches you know he's telling me
a little bit what I need to know and and
more so he's moving the stream along
where if it was just me I would be
taking more time it takes me a couple
hours to play FTL and lose yeah yeah
that's what or twice in recent days I've
got with the end boss a diet
now if fucking keeps hacking my oxygen
tanks it's obnoxious
affirmative
okay
it's fine and that that gunner he's
willing yeah powerful no well I I assume
I mean I can't i'm right i don't have
one i already use it say i have one boat
with this yeah okay yes one of the one
of the upgrades later on is four more
okay what have we got going on in the
chat here
I've never played alan wick money Hawks
money hacks your oxygen tanks its
noxious obnoxious
look I said noxious I meant obnoxious I
don't know I know I miss Brown's words
all the time that's by my job
absolutely absolutely party is happening
armchair XCOM is the best it is it
really is all right here we go here we
go
come get some
all right wait on the rocket we can't
wait on the rocket we already use the
rock gotta use the rocket once Rockets
gone but it's but he's gonna move to our
Grenadier over here oh Jesus Christ
sweet fucking Jesus Christ
wait do you have a now grenades also
take out cover right right it's right
I know I know listen I'm just gonna
should be nice you should be right right
okay that's pretty nice I like that well
but I mean I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
use it now because we're gonna we're
gonna okay okay I'm just looking seeing
what we got here that's that's the way
to do it look Saint consider right so I
don't like my cover options over here oh
no here we go hey here's the full cover
so I can get over here and I should be
able to hit him with a grenade yeah
then ideally once we take down that
cover we want him to be dead this turn
right and everyone has a shot
everyone's got a shot all right let's do
this all right do this this drop it
right on his fucking head catchphrase
grenade out that's not a good
catchphrase that's all right
she did her best yeah just her Forte is
not catchphrases now 55 that's can you
get her closer before you fire maybe I
mean I can't her eyes might go up and
she'll do I don't know if that's enough
elevation there to get an elevation
bonus but there's just no cup I'm not
sure I'm in some shitty cover but like I
said ideally he's dead this charlie yeah
I'm with you I'm with it I'm like there
55 knots simcha but that's what we tried
yeah yeah
all right let's see if we can if we can
get our sniper oh no we got him
yeah well you wanna go see if we can no
targets my ass didn't move he didn't
move
fuck you XCOM alright what about the the
hit out we got him Janna hammy move her
yeah you know move her did that one
tombstone that's close I thought fuck no
target so the one that's even closer
we're not taking yeah honestly he'll be
dead
he'll be dead we got it we got it we got
it oh god we don't got it fuck someone's
gonna die why why what happened to our
fire uh overwatch with her don't move
her
overwatch sure he's gonna have to run to
cover she might see him and take a shot
as he's gonna luck
alright it's not over yet okay I can
sing behind good cut I need a good thing
all right come here thing
let's go work it's gonna work trust me
okay fine it's fine and we win the
lottery
all the tension jesus fucking christ so
now another one's gonna die yeah yeah
right there right right in the fuck no
one else did their fucking job that's
why wait plank ass ass first you do that
yeah she's got shit aim shit aim I just
can't fucking believe that all right
hold on
so if I go here I should be able to
expose and 55% oh god yeah I can hate
him fucking head off this is the joy and
pain that is XCOM right oh wait 10% is
about that that's nothing over not high
cover at least we to the right oh wait
the right mr. Thompson area fucking fuck
fucking fuck 15%
you know the wash it over watch he's
gonna shoot man I could shoot the other
guy Tim but he's gonna want to move
because he knows his flight
yeah all right you're gonna be my bait
that's the same huh
that's insane well where else I guess he
oh yeah he's got a line of sight so okay
let me move you over here sang is saying
is valuable because once once he's on
your team and said he's a decent a
decent fellow I have on your team hi
you're gonna dad dog don't wanna say no
line of sight okay over wife she's gonna
have to move again yeah so you might get
another chance oh come on come on come
on come on come on come on come on come
on come on come on come on you're gonna
take out another one no he's running ah
okay okay I'll take a run fucking fuck
now that's no good the joy and the pain
that is XCOM oh I mean it's a coin flip
but it's something yeah I'm I'm done
with that logic I don't see what we can
do is so this guy can't do anything but
she can move and take another shitty
shot yeah and so can she
boss no she can't move fuck what's their
natural chance to hit that guy just 15
now god yeah unless I want to try to no
want to risk triggering more crops here
oh shit I didn't even think about that
yeah Iowa let's try to snipe him then
see what happens
I'm not moving him I'm just yeah I know
I know seeing if he has a line of sight
and I doesn't okay all right do it for
the dead to it for the dead and we're
just to get that sauce doesn't matter
this Mary oh yeah it's done three okay
all right
you just have to hit yes finally
you know when it goes into the action
cam that it's a-okay oh fucking out
all right everybody reload Oh God reload
well two people who died they weren't
just rookies right yeah I think so all
right so this could have been far worse
zhuang keep your head down and you
reload oh that fucking lieutenant
lieutenant Newton it's not a cult ah
let's get the group back together we're
not done yet
Tsang it's nice cover for you I got one
in front one in back pad down
and what we should reload you fuck you
rich and then one of the guys who died
fearful sledge boy
fuck you rich I was a person hahaha and
and now you're a dead person you might
want to try bringing your sniper up sure
we're getting out of oh yeah there's
wolves everywhere she's not gonna have a
line on the side up light a site in
anything okay I'm with you I'm just
gonna - it used to be a crystal instead
of a mouton but they actually altered
this level slightly for the enemy within
updating so it's it's it's now a little
time mutant whatever I keep saying wrong
but I'm dumb
and down over watch so we playing this
to the end of this month beside our goal
right now sure what time is it uh good
night at night well I have to have to
pack it up eventually I know that's why
I'm wondering now when we should call it
oh yeah yeah we'll see I mean listen one
mission at a time right yeah
did you turn into a zombie it's like I
just I love seeing the drop point and
being like come on come on come on game
you know we're almost waiting for it to
drop some shit on me
overwatch head down overwatch and sniper
rifle overwatch okay okay great great
great great reactivity in that oh okay
okay okay oh nice nice I'll take that
I'll take that 65% oh wait you should
wait 37 percent I know I know I know
don't worry well you couldn't
yeah she can't get behind that car
though okay okay five percent nothing
and what do you got you got something do
you got something eighty-one percent
that's pretty nice anyone's a higher
number mm-hmm I've heard that about
anyone all right all right all right all
right
but this fuck it's fuck right over there
it's the only one that can see this
sectoid
right yeah okay so and we don't have
good numbers on the sectoid but you know
it's something let's worry about this
other fuck all those yeah they're more
dangerous okay so first thing we're
gonna try to do sniper
good good good
fuck that bastard yep okay that's great
that's great so now now we got a
secretary to deal with though and he's
an overwatch oh fuck he's an overwatch
yep
if I run away he will shoot you he will
shoot me so no matter what he shoots me
huh so when I'm trying to flank you
later huh
don't worry about flanking you later
yeah cuz like I mean I could go into
overwatch too and just the hope he
doesn't hit me and I have good health so
I'm not terribly worried where's this
line of sites you know I'm I'm just like
is that loud yeah it's fine that's what
it's like and I don't think she doesn't
and she has no targets so it's almost
just like just sitting wait which is
kind of what I'm well can you move her
up where she gets the line of sight you
can put her on the tombstone of the
other side saying yeah but then what do
you shoot me shoot at you you know what
rich sometimes you're alright alright
I'm just wondering what her chance to
hit one baby sure
Oh apparently oh yeah here go it's not
shooting at me I know he's not shooting
at me
well cuz that went to Mercer rooms were
looked like he might not have a good
line of sight on you the end teeth like
this is why I like and I know like it's
just math but the way the map is I know
the what yeah it looks like if I would
think that you like there's a lot of
times we're learning come on look at
that it's got a clear line of sight to
me but that's fine all right well yeah
let's try taking him out then let's try
taking him out let's see what happens
that's fine
try it again
oh my god even less of a chance
overwash yeah I wish you'll hold them in
place
quite possibly we'll see I can do hey
mister - a shot nice and now he's not
never watched anymore nope you can't
move so
see where can you go no no a where can
you go oh you got nothing you got
nothing lady she goes behind that I
probably won't be able to sing from
where I can't imagine but you need to
move up anyway so come on oh yeah you
gonna fit
hello target sale that's fine that's
fine you can move her up to that one two
stone there
she can't shoot anyway and the one of
the one in front of that even she might
be able to see him from there huh
oh yeah oh yeah okay great but let's
hope let's let's see if we can deal with
him that's fun it's like I almost wanted
this hop out here and bam bam bam it
won't work that aim that guy's a mash it
totally is by the way odd mutation you
know you're probably a fine person but
your aim is shit oh yeah look at that
ham oh yeah look at that like he's a
full cup
alright well then you know what we're
just gonna hold him here until our
sniper gets to reload and you too all
right
can't do it do daily oh you just gonna -
you know what good good fucking over
what right I don't think your son up
snipers and kills one of her office it's
all good
how much she misses which she is well
you know we seem to be doing okay with
just over watching him man yeah yeah so
uh that's that's that's a good shoot
with the other one we might be able to
get ahead
Shinzon I have a 45 I know I know it
she's a trombone I'm gonna start calling
she's a truant shinza
that's what's gonna happen or something
oh we hunkered down what is that you
don't know what hunkered down this no
that's like just increased defense yep
he's scared good this fucking should be
you're scaring him jack okay excellent
61% yeah hey saw your dumb behind half
cover which got double tap shutters 20
okay be the shot anyway this is why non
oh there we go there we go alright
alright guys and do this might want to
take time to reload or down you might be
all clear but I'm not sure there might
be another guy waiting to pop up but is
that it that was around yeah alright
let's see what happens
get over here yeah let's see if this
triggers anything all right
can you get him to within the dashing
distance of her okay now I can get him I
couldn't behind that middle wall section
man this one middle one middle yeah yeah
I'm on with you watch when there's three
high walls and you're in the middle one
they can't even see you nice oh okay all
right we got overwatch oh yeah nope nope
okay yeah okay so can the same oh yo one
you need to get the end the mission I
think is saying okay
oh did it jack did it oh and that was
almost all you yeah very minimal
coaching yep again it okay oh my god oh
my god
you did good for someone who almost had
a complete squad wife the one mission
that I was terrified of I don't know
that should've been the end of your game
jack but I know you stuck with it hmm
you kept going you did it for debriefing
Oh God
we did it thank you I'm not a complete
failure now someone tell my parents that
I don't think by the way like I know I
don't know that with men's briefs mine
door is like five hours later you're
finally getting it I think that's how
long it takes to understand the game is
to our to plan on a very hard difficulty
classic is no cakewalk
oh okay so disabling shot allows the
sniper to fire a shot that causes the
target's maining a weapon to malfunction
the target may use reload to fix the
weapon clock that's great battle
scanners game device when thrown creates
a new source of vision for two turns
it's like a throwable radar you can
throw into areas that are dark and see
what's in there scout out that's pretty
nice too but fucking take out their gun
it's useful for capturing or if you got
a big enemy that you'd like that mutant
yeah take it out if you can't kill him
with one shot you can disable this
weapon while everyone else regroups yeah
that's useful I know almost everyone
loves the the radar one yeah but I think
it's kind of stupid for a sniper because
you want your sniper to hang back yeah
and that's only really useful if you're
on the front damn line oh no I'm in
total agreement by the way like taking
out an enemy's main weapon is huge
out here smoke grenade I think smoke
grenade shins directions on you got
yourself a smoke grenade and the other
ones are dead sorry everybody else well
you did game sake yes you Tod 2n2
engineers we have anything here's now we
have armor remember yes what else we're
gonna build so much armor you have five
for everybody okay we can feel fine
there you go great great
go direction oh thanks I've you soldiers
sing bang
what are you fire rocket
okay well it's warm standard shots
primary open is no longer and the turn
have taken first act she's got good aim
yeah oh there goes this person he's also
pretty so we're saying a valley so yeah
I don't know me bolts one yeah I'm gonna
try not to tell you what to do no no
absolutely okay let's see what we got a
shredder rocket fire rocket that causes
all enemy hits to take 33% damage from
all sources for the next 10 turns the
rockets blast is weaker than the
standards bracket what it does do some
damage it's a weaker rocket yeah but the
rocket also makes everybody else to do
more damage on him that's nice for the
next however many terms I have Roger
pins down a target granting reaction
fire against it and imposing a 30%
palpated am oh yeah they had bad that
now that's nice too
oh that's a tough one let's see what
these are firs damage against robotic
enemies should have a seen any of yet
confers the same reaction shot if on
overwatch and the first reaction shot is
hit oh no no let me explain this okay
for one reaction shots they naturally
have a minus 20% chance a cuz yeah I'm
theory the enemy is moving so it so for
one very overshot it's already minus 22
him to begin with right second if these
have the worst aim out of a hole
so if you get that first hit you can get
a second one there so chances are you're
gonna miss the first one anyway I won't
get the second one sure and then if you
hit on the second one you'll probably
miss on the second one anyway and you're
just burning through ammo from no good
goddamn reason all right I hate I hate
it
this one I'll let you decide but the
shredder it's like it's basically like a
second rocket so it doesn't replace your
normal one either oh oh well then that's
it if I can get two rockets and that's
it
absolutely and then he did it okay all
right great
yeah now that I thought it was replacing
my normal rocket no well it's an
addition - I like that and then we want
their previous armor oh god yes I know
it's it's it's a blessing to finally get
it but it is the ugliest in the game it
really is you can change the color Rider
it might hold those same doesn't let you
customize most of the stats
oh he's considered a special character
sure well we'll keep you bright blue and
jackass all right well let's take all of
our people and put the nice Armour out
of them
oh look out
Oh
- oh where in the world is Carmen
Sandiego yes
there yeah where in the world is Carmen
Sandiego you up topped up do I join down
there that one well no that's alright I
apparently not the ducktales song
detective this will have like different
different color armor will help me keep
them straight in my head
see I'm a weirdo I like my military guys
to have uniform color so I can give them
all some shade of green herbage we re
what some people do is they color code
them by class so they'll get like all of
their assaults red and all of their
snipers blue yeah
oh we got to change his name oh yeah we
do
all right we got mommy gap oh look at
that ugly oh that's great oh um oh wait
our snipers are red use a sniper or is
that cool
Trude true no three one one
so last name first name oh you want you
to all lesson unit root no and then
three one let's do that these first name
okay there we go
I snipers all of those all those
dark-skinned people from Norway Jack oh
yeah but now both of our snipers are
really dark skin and have red armor
that's how you keep track of shit yeah
okay I'm gonna get you the new armor oh
great
and get you the new armor hey do you use
fathering oh you know yeah I gave it to
all the people who I care about social
hierarchy more I should hire a few more
yeah
hire soldiers hire workers and it's okay
for oh my god they start marching yes
okay we got a Jew be doop to give and
never panic as a result of allies
getting wounded or killed
still pretty who's still pretty noob a
lot of them a lot of them well how about
shins on why not you know we're gonna
give shins on the supports yeah you can
make a good medic out of a support okay
I gotta think lose later on there's an
ability where you can use like the med
kit three times oh oh so if you want to
train her as a support give her a med
kit and then we'll finally have a med
kit nothing we have the bigger armor I
think the bed gets more useful okay so
if I meant kit we have one already but
oh did I yep no we don't use it Tim's on
are you happy we got a fucking med kit
now all right
well if you're gonna be a medic now
we're gonna change your armored tent to
white oh my god you get really fancy
that's why I get then do it jack
I'm really getting into it I'm getting a
little into it all right there you go
now your medic now will loan out instead
of a frag you'll have a med kit all
right I'll make sure the other snipers
got a scope - you guys go para sure we
gave her one but the dude sniper new
sniper right right we should probably
get my hat - only I'm just doing this is
in reference to the med kit it only took
five hours in all caps all right when
you're when your guys can die in one hit
it doesn't make that much sense you're
better off with grenades it's true you
need to kill them before they can kill
you I totally agree with that that's
that's my my battle philosophy on med
kits okay once you got the better you
don't die in one hit then then I start
rolling out a med kit
I got a council report in ten days beam
weapons and seven new soldiers and three
scan Jim do this work you oh my god
right okay that's fine let's scramble
the interceptors Rajon we're having one
did good last time so let's go again
Draven one get them know at some point
we're gonna want to try and upgrade our
uh
our aircraft weapons cuz there's gonna
be great Flying Saucer said start
popping up Jesus Christ
the smaller meaning
I have no I got hurt
okay okay gonna move the other one huh I
can yeah baby - okay
which Evans art of war yeah yeah look
look I don't know I don't have 500 hours
into XCOM for nothing hey okay alright
we've got 3 1 1 shins on mutation
Louisa sang all right everybody's got
the jams let's do this I think this will
be our last mission this will be our
last mission of Apollo tonight I'd like
to get a terror mission yeah okay okay
but we can do this mission let's do this
get ready to deploy our AO is within the
continent as 1230
it looks like the aliens went down in
the sparsely populated areas fire
occurred millions all right let's do
this let's do this
finally got armor Jack how's it feel I
mean you feel safer already
I do I feel like everybody's gonna get
warm hugs that's kind of like whichever
one we're facing is probably the way we
should be going
usually
look like much as over there but I guess
that's the point that's a big-ass
annoying laptop all right well my person
staying back snipers gonna stand back
chins on your one sniper doesn't have
squad sight yet so he's gonna have to
move up or he's useless okay
now then guess what you're next
no not not shake that's once one side
that's the leveled up one oh yeah
there's the other one with the hat I was
looking for I was looking for my red hat
headed there now
seeing where everybody's at don't find
em I'm fine with five Japan got slow
going steady oh we get to the tree you
are ready to go
