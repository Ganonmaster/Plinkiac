that sounds great great great waiting
for player to join I had assumed there's
only five bucks by the way I had that
soon as this would be a like a same
screen multiplayer review why why would
you assume that in this day and age your
baby on the baby oh okay and there's the
dad and the dad has to protect you the
baby only good how do I get on air you
got jump out oh there you go alright

find a way to kill ourselves in the room
once sure it's probably a bunch of ways
to kill ourselves enter it
oh oh oh it just tell them we're good
nice the air vents or teleports you're
in the kiddo you're in the kitchen now
you how I just hit myself in the head
I probably didn't kill you though what's
that batteries nice eat battery
oh you see the whole batteries
nice there we go and I and now you're
talking
get in that oven get in that oven I have
to turn it on
by the middle one does not look down
does that turn it right yeah I guess
turn him off why not yay daddy was just
useless you killed yourself he wants a
rematch all right daddy wants a rematch
your daddy has abandoned you
Oh No I wonder if you dad because the
governor because of the batteries
batteries Yuri did you say me it was
green join I kind of this music is gonna
get tiresome really quickly but I kind
of love it
all right oh you're the dad now where's
the baby
the baby's probably in its crib so we
know it can teleport to the kitchen so
get to that kitchen Oh yep look I
already in the batteries okay
this baby knows what's up no grab the
baby put it back in this crib
can you grab the rivet hey I would grab
the baby I cannot grab the baby oh oh
you grabbed a knife nice put it down
oh you locked the oven oh he's eating
batteries
well how much we'll just hop him jack I
don't know
what's right play baby so baby got a
fork and electrocuted himself so you
can't grab the baby Oh your baby has
left to find a new daddy well be too
easy to grab the nephews grab the baby
and hold on to the baby I suppose and if
something the baby has a huge advantage
that kitchen is the key that kitchen is
the key to all this it's gotta be
something I can do and you grab him
batteries from under there cuz you know
that's easy that's number one how my
crouched and I knew pretty good by
region you can reach them from there
no I can't again there that's not
helping
this has got to be about I can jump you
can pick one up and you just have to
pick him up one at a time the baby's
gonna kill himself by then where's the
baby
I was tense that baby's probably still
upstairs I think you got a new baby that
baby's right upstairs just thinking
about how to kill himself it's gonna
fall down the stairs slack
check in the room just looking don't
open the door okay he's been here shit
he's in the kitchen
yep okay he's in the kitchen
run dead Oh got that hammer from the
baby you can't have that hammer you need
to figure out how to drop things hold on
let me uh look up how to uh controls how
do I drop things I'm looking that up
controls for look just follow that baby
pick pick up again are you duck soir oh
there's a swap well I need power I can't
do anything jack I can't even duck Jack
maybes gonna be there I got the key
great oh shit
I broke the I broke the thing oh he's
green
ruined I can't drop things I'm gonna
hammer my hand that I can't put down I
get up I'm getting there I'm getting
there rich I'm looking up the control or
just quit the menu let's look up the
controls run direct grabbin
grab drop so he or the left or left
Mouse clip is interacting he doesn't
drop anything you can only swap is there
there's got to be a duck so I can get
lower right you know use the left hand
item I don't think there is rich Hey all
right let's keep on keeping on those it
no I'm saying I'm gonna keep right on
keep on
developers didn't know how to code in a
duck that's probably true this game is
in alpha
there's another creaking button no
there's to create came poppers maybe uh
I'm just one crate game button is needed
look they go yeah baby
you can do this you can do this you can
do this you can do this you can do is it
procedurally generated I don't know that
makes sense
what
I want the vent oh yeah you need the
vent the vent is that clear I like
getting to that kitchen is the clear
answer unless you can oh oh daddy knows
what's up already it's in his hand don't
care you can lock the cabinet you fucker
go up and grab that dildo can you close
the door this is hurting me I would
assume it is yeah there's the video well
what's the green thing in there I'm
suing this health which doesn't appear
to be going down I just give it a second
I'd assume locking yourself in the
fridge is suffocation
I've seen that punky brewster episode
is that true
I don't think it's fridges working mm
probably not yep
open fridge go out and jump on glass is
what they say oh you ate the trash nice
have to figure out how to lock those
batteries up ooh everything's looking
funky oh let's just about jumping on
glass open up the fridge and just see if
it's like you can reach up or something
or jump up or how can you jump on that
glass up there yeah you might be able to
make it up to that second shelf
all right now what yeah can you like
jump on it again break it no jump up to
the next one
no that's not working Oh fresh one you
didn't because he's doing you're doing
okay great
oh the glass table no this is not the
only thing on the agenda our plan is to
play this until you're already bored you
guys are already bored of it I just it
seems like so far oh so how do we lock
the fucking things sure right look at
all the drawers and see if you can find
a so lock the oven isn't an option
yeah up on the top see the red lock oh
oh that you can save the baby I think
good that other locks the other dad had
a lock that he locked the cabinet with
gotta find that find our fucker baby
right with a dildo somewhere like babies
do checking the room but it's class
story glass windows is he in there no
he's not he's small it could be in the
corner let's wait we don't know that
that
being the baby is kind of fun yeah being
the dad is just frustrating
we got the hammer how do you where'd the
pills go
they're in your hand still right no
they're not in my hand can right click
the pills vanished from my hand after I
grabbed them oh oh oh yeah like he broke
through baby girl he broke through last
you can do this rich I don't think I can
okay great I think being the dad kind of
sucks I mean it's kind of what it you
know it's a lot of work it's a lot of
work and responsibility so in any case
we're gonna play this for a little bit
until we're bored of it and then we're
going to continue our undertale
playthrough until we get to did you say
that no oh it's gonna be under to lunch
at once they in turtleman's there too
come on doesn't have another channel
there's no I'm stuck in the drawer we
did someone someone last dream gave us a
tip open ice with the express purpose of
us buying powerball tickets with Oh
dad's in there already
okay okay
dad doesn't know what's going on it
doesn't know what's going on
and so when ten o'clock about 10 o'clock
rolls around we will be we're gonna take
a little pause and check our Powerball
numbers
why is everyone about Powerball because
the Powerball jackpot is 1.5 billion
with a B and so everyone is very excited
about that jackpot found yourself Oh Oh
dad I'm still gonna die from poison he's
schmuck oh he's trying to trap you in
there daddy your dad and we you have no
chance of winning it and I would not
have bought tickets if it wasn't for
someone literally like giving they gave
us a tip and and said you know buy
Powerball tickets with this and so we're
gonna do that because it'll kill some
time it's gonna die her that's all I'm
gonna do just gonna die up here that's
Jesus oh I'm sorry oh oh oh there you go
hey Dad I drank a bunch of boys and oh
he's got the pills Oh your daddy gives
you a pill
is it enough no oh yeah your your health
is not going down anymore if if I give a
tip explicitly to buy particular liquor
will you and Lord Belmont yeah sure
absolutely
that's kind of what the tips are
therefore I don't know if we can get it
here but I will try
you gotta find more events that's I get
nice locker rooms
I think it's doomed
I think it's doomed I think I'm doomed
to live
be sure to either garbage there you go
nice I got it does not mean he will
drink it I you know oh there you go nice
nice rich yeah you know what those are
nice back and forth tried to save you
you tried to die that was a great game
okay I will I will drink it on stream if
you also tip enough for a taxi ride home
because I will not drink and drive but
yeah yeah good night on the couch might
be able to get up there I don't know I
don't know we're safe from the baby is
probably not know where something got
checking that baby he's probably in that
be in the kitchen already
I'm gonna find the locks yeah where did
that guy have that bottle there's the
fork put that in the sink
oh well no you have it I guess oh wait
maybe you can swap it for the pill for
the pills and then then it'll be in the
drawer there you go there you go there
you go is that baby what's that baby
doing rich I don't have any idea what
the babies it's that baby doing
Lord Belmont hey you hack frauds didn't
print enough space cop blu-rays I was
ready and willing to give our alumni
money but none left that's true
we'll have more shortly we'll have more
shortly very sorry for any inconvenience
where's the baby I don't think I don't
think anyone was prepared I don't think
anyone was prepared for how much people
wanted this
the pills are knew he could price off
the knife for another pill oh there it
is
nice reach nice Fritch locking them up
Oh where's that baby was that a shadow
is I think the baby might still be in
your bedroom when the pills go they lost
her pills
what how did baby die I don't know I
don't know why my pills keep vanishing
how many have we sold so far I don't
know the exact number all of them we've
sold all of them there were many boxes
here before and now there are none where
did that baby find that fork you can run
yeah baby run baby run can you open the
door you can yeah that dad's gonna go
right to the kitchen because that's
where he thinks you're gonna be oh I get
it one's a health meter
yeah stamina okay I get it
you got this you got this you got this
rich get that bleach drink that bleach
what's that like a little hidey-hole oh
it's locked
secret hatch rich I know I have no idea
how many blu-rays they are oh there's

blu-rays they ordered however many was
they no longer have them eat glass nice
rich nice never wealthy always rich rich
but remand when I Jack knocked over the
wheel of doors
um have you been I was available I was
irritated because I built it and I know
it's probably not the most stable thing
and note existence yes so you were
irritated where's the smoke detector Oh
interesting
learn to power I heard a thing
you heard a peekaboo power Oh Crouch
gotta wait for the baby to grab it first
I guess cabinets
he's up oh I might be randomized
oh yeah and I could see that I could see
that it was a kid when I knocked it over
I and I I knew I was gonna knock it over
yeah you know I had that thought before
knocking it over like yeah do I really
want to knock it over people you know
you guys might get annoyed but I decided
it was worth it for entertainment
purposes and obviously if it would have
broken I would have helped repair it all
right but pills pills pills well right
now I gotta find that baby and given
pills where's the baby
why busy eating stuff already probably
yeah what would you do if you were the
baby

piece of this and I said that George
Miller will not direct another Mad Max
film George Miller said he does not want

know what he gave us plenty of them yeah
and if he doesn't want to do any more
all right said but can they top fury
road
can they you know it's fine it's fine
if here's the thing if George Miller
probably thought he had a Mad Max sequel
worth making he'd be making it he
wouldn't be saying I'm not going to do
it anymore
absolutely so the fact that he's not
doing it means he doesn't have any great
ideas for it and okay don't do it that's
that's that's the right hole that's very
um very big of you rich
that's very open open-minded of you Oh

could be a good move right here where's
the baby where's the baby hiding I've
checked all the spots of course he's not
in the tub I already took the stuff he
would be stupid to go in that's all we
found it or just gave you an apple

good it's not it's not keep you alive
forever it's just keep you alive for the
kid yeah yep
that's that's that's that's one plate
yeah we need to see if we can get that
dildo I agree what is it with you people
I mean seriously with that situation oh
here comes the baby there's a cabinet
block anyway yeah I can see that
interesting going for the poison oh no
going for the fork grab that for grab
that fork nice
you got the fork he doesn't know he
dropped it thank
nice okay what a baby easy drowning was
he drowning
nope I'm trying oh he's a drinker poison
yeah probably drinking poison wait no I
did it back there but he's in this
closet you took the vent you think now
he's under the eyes under the sink
that's what it quickest poison is yeah
there is
I can't talk how do you crowd fry
tonight oh yeah there is get him there
yeah well I'm sure he drank the bleach
after that nice yeah we played this game
before our baby
Oh
get more fruit more fruit
go bitch go bridge go oh he's a sneaky
little bastard they're saying control
okay might be a to crouch as the daddy
quite possibly control aah Chinese New
Year well Happy New Year for the year
what is it what is this year in Chinese
the year of the dragon the year of the
pig the year the rooster the year of the
Banksy's
right behind him right behind him you
snuck in there snuck in there it is the
year of the dildo year of the poison
baby it's more entertaining that should
be it really is like I could see if we
got a couple more like some different
levels some more randomization and some
more ways to kill yourself but it does
once you figure out all the ways to kill
yourself there's a nice balance to it
remember sometimes it's in the living
room
if there is more he fully forked it the
fork the fork was everywhere year of the
space cop fuck yes the year of the space
cop I can't wait until people see space
cop fridge
I've watched I've now watched space got
four times why mostly because I can and
genuinely I think it's funny it's the
movie event of the year it's the movie
event I can say that because the force
awakens came out last year fork anti
bleep boom quick for kill
if I tried cooking food with the frying
pan no this game makes me curious how
dangerous it really is to stick a fork
in an outlet most outlets now have
safety measures built in actually where
you need the two prongs of an outlet to
even open it up to electricity that's
okay okay so most modern outlets have
protection built-in if you can get a
fork in there it's still pretty
dangerous cuz it creates a metal contact
in that sense electricity to you yeah
you gotta go save that baby I'll try to
prevent the quick death Oh oh good
there's that and there's a pill right
there hey go find that baby now
baby banging okay where was it yeah how
what hmm
that might have been that weird death
thing or he might have been cheesy never
be on the other side of the wall behind
a counter something yeah yeah yeah I'm
not an electrician no I'm not an
electrician but you know we've had we've
we've recently done some remodeling as
you guys know and all the new outlets
are specialized outlets where they're
they're self closed off and you need
both prongs of your plug to be in there
in order to open it up it's a safety
measure
Oh interesting drinks and bleach
yep
he gave me a pill oh and it took the
bleach
and run run run run run run run ice you
couldn't get my hair the Crouch
animation is terrifying I agree
Oh Oh baby's going grab that hammer
right away boom my hammer my hammer baby
nice we're gonna we're never going down
rich you gotta find that baby get out of
the closet baby we love you for who you
are
where's that baby
yeah gotta buy some time so poison but
that'll buy you some time
where are the stupid locks I hate those
box check I'm sorry baby I might be
trying to drown himself Oh No
just drank more poison fine will not be
fine
what are you doing rich what's the plan
um find the baby and sure him behind the
couch is nice he's got a key I don't
know if he can stick the key in an
outlet
you got this rich you got this nice OOP
oh he's dead
you got to get more fruit in him you got
to get more fruit in him go fruit it up
rich fruit it up little fucker he's a
good evil baby nice that bought some
time that bought some time
Oh God pick it up and do it rich oh
shoot the baby with the gun hmm what's
his locks never spawn mode there might
you know awesome noxious I don't I'm not
sure this game was designed for
longevity and I can't even see you guys
working it nice
stealth mode he went in the bathroom
right yeah into the living room have II
didn't think to go upstairs
Oh fork outlet go I don't know if you
can pull the tv down on yourself I think
the baby tried to do that last run and
we just kind of saw it not kill the baby
so but do the do Badoon you pretty much
expected never find the locks that's
random yeah that Fork is overpowered
like the fork or that's why it like
riches riches main plan of outlet covers
right away is the correct plan because
that fork is an insta-kill
or what I would prefer is the cabinet
locked so I can keep him getting two oh
four cruisers usually on the cabinet
right then you eliminate a lot of the
poison yep yeah yep random
I know listen Elvis I know we're all
curious about the dildo we just want to
know what it does it's just a dildo
hiding behind the toilet behind the
toilet didn't answer you he didn't see
you that worked he didn't see rich
worked he didn't see you behind the
toilet no stay there what are you doing
behind the chemicals you check the
cabinet oh how did he find you you work
you gotta give you an apple he's buying
time yep nice even smooth motion all
right you got this rich you got this I
don't think he knows that you're still
poisoned yet but he'll figure it out and
he's coming for you soon oh yeah oh he's
coming he's coming he's coming oh I gave
you a pill get downstairs
welcome you can find the locks oh he got
ya you can still find a hammer probably
locked away drink some more bleach maybe
we trying to trap you with those yeah oh
he's just fucking around with it now he
got all the shit oh now he did I hate
you hate you dad
you know fun
uh I don't like you at all I believe
they're like a fork or knife and the
cabinet's upstairs could be wrong that's
what they're saying
cabinets upstairs there's drawers
upstairs button
he gave you a bell right energy drink
bleach again no yeah you're fine rich
hmm hey you want to take over no no
you're doing great you're doing great I
I can't or urban vermin I can't talk
about David Bowie it's sad it's it's
very sad I didn't I but here's how
little I knew about David Bowie I didn't
even know he was sick you know no walks
never a walk for me you know I'd never
much listened to his music I haven't
even I don't even know the last time
I've seen labyrinth
oh he's got nice he's got a knife you
sure yep
all right now else else pills pills
pills pills pills pills pills pills
pills pills pills I'm up there pills
where to go workout where to go
hiding behind couches probably yep yes
first strategy that's its preferred
strategy oh really
bullshit yeah he was in the prestige I
didn't haven't seen the prestige I I
there's just you know obviously it's
very sad when anyone dies but David
Bowie's life and death have affected me
in very little ways
if you grab the dildo you can smash the
window and break this cycle you're in a
cycle rich
people when your dildos I'll never
understand you people I can't even get
out that although it's because you're
not trying hard enough I really don't
want a dildo I think it's the honest
truth yeah
wisely I cannot pay them that was some
good design don't now the dad has had
time to childproof everything down here
don't let the baby pick up the deal
though Cheryl I guess you can stick it
to the bleach in the closet
oh nice oh is he's too busy
baby-proofing is he not gonna see ya
yeah boom boom double soap the soap
grounding wins the day rich I was
similarly jaded to near Nimoy's death
there there are celebrity deaths that
mean a lot to me and there are celebrity
deaths that don't mean anything to me
and I'm very I you know obviously David
Bowie was a very popular musician and I
mean even more than a musician and a lot
of people loved him and I get that I
really like golden years golden years
with that song is golden yeah whoo but
see the baby has a fork he doesn't
already fucked and so you know I
understand your pain sadness upset a
tude he's hiding in that cabinet
probably with bleach I guess yep in the
knife
some routine before he goes crazy finish
this though cuz he's got that knife sure
yep Oh same thing I did this is Jed
jinxed Ron this is this is rich Evans of

whoa who's your undertale select game
undertale okay and update whoa oh my god
settle down what time is it it is 9:30
what time is it boy that is a good
question what time was what times
Powerball do their shit we got a
Powerball Powerball I just googled
Powerball it's tonight
does that help nope that doesn't help
last stream we got tipped we got tipped
by just this guy you know he gave us
some money to buy Powerball tickets so
just this guy you know we did we bought
Powerball tickets with the money that
you tipped us for the Powerball
doo-doo-doo I don't know Dook Dook
bifida do ya when's the next drawing
when's the next drawing failed to start
app already running except it's not oh
well there you go
when do they draw the Powerball no it
says nine 59-year time so we have about
20 minutes hey current estimated jackpot
is 1.5 billion dollars with a be a
billion undertale with a 930 million
thinks under channels running values not
running it's amazing that's amazing
for some reason Jack wants to take the
lump sum you always take the lump sum
you'd never take a lump sum someone tell
Rick how wrong is why is it wrong to
take the lump sum no it's right to take
why is it wasn't right to take a lump
sum because in the end you will get more
if you take the lump sum and invest by
the time you can't because the way that
your your and your investments are
guaranteed to pay out rather than having
the guaranteed what sixty million
dollars a year for the next thirty years
always take the lump sum what does the
chance always take the lump sum I always
take the lump sum I think you're just
getting yeah I think you're blinded by
dollar signs you're blinded by dollar
signs now this is how I say people end
up miserable and broke after they win
the lottery this is why no no this is
why your palm take all those money and
then they do stupid things and money's
gone don't have any more oh you don't
need super thin but don't take all of
the money out of the spread out at once
don't write it out thirty years that
will and then you're dead and you've
still got thirty million dollar checks
coming your way every fucking year oh
it's you cannot you cannot will that you
can't will lottery winnings what do you
what do you care you're dead by that
point if you can't manage thirty million
a year the fuck is right of you you
don't you don't get thirty million a
year you get a lump sum a year or you
get you know so much here I don't how do
they do it jack is right for once
yeah yeah Oh jack is wrong rich is right
hmm also we obviously we won't win the
lottery
yeah even a simple even with simple like
even if you take the lump sum put half
of it in a basic savings account by the
time you get to by the time everywhere
your relatives has their little piece
you don't give it to any of your own Oh
your mother and your father and your
brothers and your sisters fuck all of
them your cold-hearted son of a bitch
see this is why Jack's wrong no this is
what Jack is a riches right
goddamn you can make two mil a year from
Treasury bonds right yeah simple secure
investments would yield a higher output
than the thing the lottery would give
you and then you would also have a
larger lump sum to do with what you will
and then you can do stuff like will it's
I I hope I hope we don't win so so we
don't have to have this argument later
this would be like a bitter violent
argument there's no argument when we
talk about what to do with this money
there's no argument cuz I bought the
tickets I wanted to do on the chance
donation on the numbers that that me
Mike James Jesse picked I bought them I
get the consent Oh
taking the lump sum and splitting it and
then you can do what you want
Wow yeah that's I'm making that go fine
it's fine everything's fine I always
take the lump sum that's the smart we
can google it right now
you do that I'm curious what Google has
it's a smart move no not what most
people do what's a smart move what does
an economist say what does what does a
the lump sum lottery do you take the
lump sum that's what I just Google first
first result says your Powerball winner
take our advice and take the annuity hmm
oh oh
best of all that's the very first result
on Google well there's no well that's no
no that's all because it's an article in
its news should you take the annuity or
the lump sum let's go to Business
Insider you do let's see here have you
found anyone have you found anyone
that's illegal working yet okay there's
curious if you take the let's see here
there's Eltham more after-tax dollars
then if you take the lumps out my page
here money management
Oh what
that actually just doesn't say anything
I was reading an article I just didn't
say anything
okay here's Business Insider we spoke
and I have not read and I had we spoke
to several financial advisers as to how
they would advise a client who came to
them after hitting the jackpot
the key question we want to know is
whether the winner should take all the
cash upfront or whether one should take
the annuity which consists of more money
spaced out over several years but first
before we ain't sewn no not put first
nice
come on
come and get to the get to the good
stuff here
this is their burying the lede here
we've to do to do to do to do to do to
do to do scroll on the bottom of the art
of grain
okay according to our research if you
invest it all and if you can obtain it
and that well and if you can obtain an
annual return of more than three and
four percent the lump sum makes more
makes sense over the annuity thirty
years down the line okay
so investing it and getting a three to
four percent return which is easily
doable and that's it that's only
investing at all so there are pros and
