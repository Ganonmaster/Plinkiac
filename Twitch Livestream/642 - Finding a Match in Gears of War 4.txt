Jack: So we want Social Quickplay? 
Rich: Go to, go to core.
Jack: Core modes.
Rich: Try and find a...guardian match.
Jack: Okay. 
Rich: I used to love, uh, guardian mode, on Gears II.
Jack: Oh, okay. Uh, has it been running well on the PC so far?
Rich: Yeah. No problems. Then again, we have a really nice PC...
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: ...for the gaming stuff.
Jack: Yes.
Rich: So...
Jack: But no problems.
Rich: But no problems.
Jack: Great. Oh, matchmaking timed out.
Rich: Oh, no. Try again. 
Jack: No, wait. Now it's sending Cancel Request. So now we have to wait for it to cancel the thing it told me it's canceling.
Rich: How new is this game? 
Jack: I mean, less than a week. Sending Cancel Request, Rich. 
Rich: Okay.
Jack: I am trying to go back...
Rich: Okay.
Jack: ...and it won't let me go back because it's sending the cancel request.
Rich: Ughh...
Jack: Just, can you let me back out of this menu now? 
Rich: I know, isn't it great? Isn't it great?
Jack: This is terrible, Rich.
Rich: Sending Cancel Request. Isn't this insane? 
Jack: It stopped looking for a game at five minutes.
Rich: I know. 
Jack: And so now it's been two and a half minutes... 
Rich: I know.
Jack: ...just to cancel the thing it told us it had to cancel, Rich.
Rich: Ughh. Let's just close the game. 
Jack: Just X the game? Great. So that was our experiment in multiplayer Gears of War. That's great. We're gonna try again?
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Okay. Social Quickplay? Great, let's do it. Identifying Potential Opponents. So this is the first option. This is the most generic...this is quickplay.
Rich: Yeah, yeah.
Jack: This is quickplay, let's see how long it takes. 
Rich: Why does this take so long? I have no idea. 
Jack: It takes long cuz there's not a lot of people playing. Rich, they're saying they like the beard.
Rich: Thank you.
Jack: The beard is back.
Rich: Thank you.
Jack: Now his beard's back. You look good with a beard.
Rich: I shaved it off. I kind of regretted it.
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: So...
Jack: You look good with a beard.
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Yeah. 
Rich: Oh. Matchmaking Error. Please Try Again Later. 
Jack: Okay. Sending Cancel Request. Son of a bitch. Sending Cancel Request. Okay. 
Rich: This is social mode. This is, like, the most generic one.
Jack: This is the first one.
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: The, like, oh, I want to try out the online. I'll just try social mode. Like. that's the first one. 
Rich: It's, it's terrible. 
Jack: I, I think, I think everything is gonna be fine. By the way, we've been officially sending our cancel request for longer than they searched for a game.
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Just putting that out there. It gave up searching for a game after five minutes. It has not given up sending that cancel request, though.
Rich: Ughh...
