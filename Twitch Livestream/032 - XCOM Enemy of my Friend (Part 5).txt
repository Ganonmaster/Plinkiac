about that jam in the building now hey
yeah rich why do you hate Bruce that's
because the aliens are always in the
fucking building and then you got your
best aim character on a roof where he
can't do jack shit what if the aliens
run out of the building then he's on the
roof and he can just shoot that's right
that's right J I don't know why I don't
know anything about what's going on in
this game that's fine I'm just gonna
make up my own uh that's funky is about
tap-in Rich's are strong and independent
black woman no one's making that noise
we saw them already why do I hate
foundations I don't eat foundations
they're just not as awesome as Roose
the fuck was that noise it's over rich
she has the high ground yeah that's
right that's a reference to Star Wars
Episode one The Phantom Menace roof cyst

Coke Zero no they need to just die I
don't know I don't know anything about
him outside of those movies so he could
sit down next to that window there yes
my exam what was the episode three I was
making a joke whatever
nobody knows jokes nobody knows jokes
come on man what are you some kind of
comedian what do you what do you know
what did you make comedy
I'm gonna laugh if while you're
positioning yourself to go into building
they go around on the outside and thank
you we might be fucked
let me that before I guess it what I
just know Jack this is a very important
mission is it oh yeah why is that
cuz that's my breath if you win you get
a free sniper oh you're totally oh god
oh my god what just happened
you got sleep I got flanked no okay you
move too much we can't shoot you that's
good
you fucking alien fuck oh you got flag
you're not flying we got fucking five
you don't you can do get it you can
flank the flanker yeah cuz she's got
enough movement to get right to the edge
oh my god right there oh that guy what
the random stats you got a guy with some
great distance yeah that's good okay
well let's do it uh fuck you flanker I'm
totally gonna fuck your shit up
now 90 percent oh that's pretty good
rookies should be honored oh I can't
I'll kill my own guys if you can get it
out far enough it might miss see what
you can do with the rocket can you get
get closer oh wow we're gonna see him
all right you can't hold on
what shots what shots can you get with
other people I'm fine no Chaves move
closer and see if you can take one
I can move move here and then you might
be able to get up with a grenade I'm
gonna lock in use him yeah let's try
that let's try that fucking rookie
flight fail no no no no that's okay we
we know we yeah II know we have the
rocket I just want to yeah okay
fucker kind of fucker misses is your
point-blank shot like that some asshole
oh alright well fucking rocket whatever
yeah I know the rocket canvas but it's
probably the best shot worth worth
killing this guy somebody's if we don't
do the rocket I mean somebody could have
died either way
that nothing going on over here
they're all about the little Jack I'm
getting that Jam I'll tell you what you
don't even know what it does yet no it's
part of the mission dog all right we got
to get someone else over it now you can
get a little bit closer we can get
behind that
that ATM machine yeah gotta get someone
we're gonna protect dumbass miss
point-blank shot ass fuck that fuck jack
that dumbasses subscriber okay I think
you should be careful Oh thinman yep
well they get things these big it gets
progressively oh god why do they both
activate oh that's not good that's not
at all you know what I do
retreat no no you can then you can
totally flank that then don't don't get
that canister don't get the other side
of the truck and take shot on that than
men
not that side yeah I think I can make
this think you can you're standing on
the other side that's where I move till
we loose
stupidly all right you got white yeah
wait I got a plank
it's working though since she's right
yeah yeah still up there
yep
if only I could get it to that roof that
roof would not be any help at all Jax I
think no I think if I got a fan I'm in
favor of the roof like you know get up
here BAM you go do that
I'm gonna go mercer what coffins are you
going around Oh cuz there's fire
yep oh that's smart I guess John keel
over
I'll see you God can you see them even
67 move of the yes and I can move too I
can move here you're saying yeah move
over there you might have does he flank
from there no he's not flight no way
yeah same you got but yeah I hope I'll
take it see if we get something Wow
all right we gotta get these fucks out
of the way
hi wait go next to the dorms you got
full cover line you can probably take a
shot at that other one yeah yeah yeah
all right
no over watch them probably chef Jesus
Christ and get him on the rope huh get
him on the rope
yeah fuck yeah oh it's you know it isn't
fucking roof time dog yeah roofs musical
the signs as close to the action
yeah I'm just seeing what's over there
whoa whoa what what B not over watch I
got over watch dog I'm sorry he's fine
he's fine
okay see oh you're fine yeah care for
that roof I'm gonna love it at the
thinman jump up on the roof cuz they can
do that they can do that yeah of course
they can Oh John kilo is not dead
John kilo is dead and we're so fucked
all right what's happening what's
happening
you took another shot you hit them but
you didn't kill him okay suppress yeah
oh that means the that's another ability
you know your soldiers haven't the ten
men do they can they can suppress your
soldiers once they're shooting at them
like that your aim is reduced and if you
try to move away they'll take it over
wash out sure I who's suppressive him
I hope I can't see because you're up on
the roof and I have a great vantage
point what are you saying we're gonna
get over here we're gonna flank we're
gonna do this junky Llosa's no that's
great you can't see anybody all right
you know you might not be able to see
anything but that means that they can't
see him oh we there you go
that's why roofs are great deal no I
don't want to I want to go over here I
want to go through this giant hole
that's a wall is that a wall yeah it's
transparent so you can see what's in the
room oh I thought they blew it up no
okay all right covering her this is a
hole though uh yes all the holes look
like hole you can move over the other
side of the door already might be able
to see somebody from bad spot oh not
that side of the door
oh that's print flanking position Oh No
well I'm here now don't worry I have a
15 percent chance to him all right
what's here they do oh he doesn't even
know that I'm right there I'm totally
gonna fucking get him
fucking rookies mist mist all right hi
all right
you know what to do like tonight you
should bring your rough guy yeah Oh way
to bring them down and behind okay
instead of shooting from the roof can I
shoot from the roof no I can't even
shoot from the earth you know where I
would go can you go down into that
corner or set dashing it's not dashing I
don't believe it's no it's done the blue
all right like his ass yeah so I could
go here and get a pretty decent shot out
yeah all right let's do it
oh wait slight change of plans
oh there's two over here grenade okay
the two of them will kill one outright
and you'll bring the other one down to
lower health yeah oh that's even better
and then the he'll be completely exposed
for one of your other guys
oh man going up to the roof was a great
idea once you got down off the roof
haha but I needed to go up into the roof
in order to get the Vantage okay take
the one that's exposed completely can
you move her up to a spot where she's
not exposed before you take that more to
the right next to the windows up up
further in the building like know by the
way below what not right I'm sorry
yeah like sure no no no not inside like
right outside the building okay yeah I
get confused cuz like the wall some
walls are known I have no cover oh wait
can I move over here yeah oh yeah okay
ah that's great what about the other one
5500 60% chance critical for both
fucking rookies I can prank your native
both thank know for maybe in Grenada one
of them okay yeah yeah yeah all right
let's do that
I owe ya one down and why do you have
that nothing lady you got nothing there
wall here no I got no shot I gotta put
it on the other side of a couch you
might have a shot on somebody aside I'm
on this on the couch well yeah there's
another little dippy alien right here I
know you can create him the dippy Eliana
good dippy alien yeah okay I can put her
here that's got a grenade
yeah let's created his let's create his
ass
suck on this oh he's running away
oh yeah he's probably gonna kill me yep
Oh God oh oh oh
someone panicked and they hunker down in
a panic again there's two panics okay
okay so you got one little bullet bonus
help a good man yeah he's got one health
left I just got to get to him but I
don't think I can
where is he he's over here can I get to
the roof here's the thing if I could
have gotten to the problem was your
soldier who's panicking you have a
grenade well we will find out next term
yeah I can't I can't get to her yeah I
got to get to some decent cover over
here is there a decent cover inside
anywhere I can go here a little bit
afraid that wall might burn down well
yeah I can do that yeah grenades my
throw you sell them collapse before oh
sure I can go here that's not bad if I
get a shot from here I don't think you
can other we cannot overwatch is your
friend overwatch is my friend
all right I'll Linda we did need eight
at once

I'm happy with that think that and odd
mutation gets promoted happy that's good

character to have bad aim on okay

buddy that's just how we only got three
you've gone crazy yeah it's fun okay

all right great no I'd give her a soul
101 mm okay nope yep
nope yep boom let's go scoped it now
we're gonna we gonna good or again we
gonna we gonna pick her up
we had our level ups go to the abilities
you can do that you you wouldn't win a
soldier on as a prize for like one of
the missions yeah they're higher ranking
oh I assumed they would already come
that's why I was so big on doing that
mission even though the panic was worse
than other countries sure all right
so snapshot removes the sniper rifles
restriction on firing an overwatch after
movement oh that's nice
doctor to this I want us firing at
targets and any allies say you can stay
far in the back as long as your allies
see somebody as long as you have a line
of sight on the person your ally sees
you can shoot somebody from across the
map fuck yeah
okay
confers to bonus damage of pistols
confers plus ten a m-- and plus ten
defense against enemies at lower
elevation oh so it's you to create a
room in mind when your you gunslinger
does make your sniper a bit more mobile
okay it is it's not a bad one I know you
love rough I know I know which one
you're going to take I'm just saying
that Ben slinger is not a bad one
especially when you get like some of the
higher missiles okay you I mean listen I
love rooms but they have not proven in
that 10 percent ain't using you you
already already has great yeah okay yeah
you're right
alright great shake lose to V from
Canada you look great
good fantastic alright great great great
what do we need to do now um no more
missions let's go go back I'm gonna oh
yeah yeah we're that's okay that's okay
that's okay go back to the engineering
section there's pant I can sell that
right I know sounds I ever go we can put
a sever outside right there if we want
to better ah gonna build facilities can
go to the one that's open and see if we
can build that officer training school
yet build immediately
okay okay all right so now we need the
mission of the satellite wait till the
end wait till the end of our mission
South Africa
come on Doc Kurt there's there's
something coming up or we might be able
to reduce the panic okay oh we got a
heart my god christ almighty all right
all right
within minutes yeah you know like a
walking beam weapon then we can get all
these other ones that you want okay let
me see the other ones I'm just curious
I've already put the new recruits to
work in the lab now the combin member
the experiments or is how long on the
theme weapons everything this
you got carapace there's a lot of other
priorities to thing okay Oh Oh any more
engineers Oh
now let's look for a mission Oh perfect
okay wait it's a UFO
sometimes they there they land oh okay
I was the problem is if they land yeah
there's more enemies oh no you're going
with the generic soldier didn't we name
well yeah but have them died Oh
true that well touching down bucket will
name him later sorry I had to move out
States UFOs set down in a sparsely
populated area we need to locate and
eliminate the invader let's fucking do
this
great hey that's great that's great
and great and great sure move a sniper
last right well cuz knife or canal yeah
actually gonna eat you should even hang
back right fuck is this fuck you're in
the woods weird okay we're game reasons
everything has to be at right angles
right already
Oh who'd you get bill good focus on
aliens there's somebody in your line of
sight you got three alien heads have
popped up at the top left oh you're just
out of there seeing you range you could
take a free shot Oh
30% that's crap alright that's oh that's
your salt yeah
what is your sniper grad she doesn't
have - I guess the trees on the way I
can move her don't move anybody up
further than that assault I mean I
couldn't like if I just move her right
here move her further away on the other
shooting there are no rooms I know
they're right okay like right here uh
well no no poor against those rocks to
the right guys I think okay
so now next term look yeah I got the I
got the jam yeah I put your other guys
in come on
but don't go further than that assault
okay okay over watching Paul over
watching them all jabber tapper no can't
just end the turn
I can pistol it no that's fine move it
now overwatch oh okay
get free shots on them and nobody okay
okay
oh yeah but now they know that we are I
know I know trees are not nature's roofs
what are you it in hit is so inaccurate
sure they are no they're not roofs
period they're trees is there a tree
blogging or site with falcon but you
didn't see anybody so this up is
critical it up is critical which isn't
important here because we can see we see
one person so just go for see what
happens oh yeah as well
oh that's fine all right we got a pair
never got there
we aren't they they're down there you're
you're in bad cover all around I noticed
that I won't tell you there either
should everything's a half wall I know I
know
wide move move up and hunker down yeah
visual on the goods I can you get there
yeah you can get there and then we'll
move you up here and sniper we already
already jammed okay so now we hunker
yeah oh so we're gonna hunker so hard
appreciate great in that wall
but wait oh I'll let them move a little
closer want them come in for it my god
oh yeah coming in for it we should also
have to get that sniper okay you've got
nothing nothing you've got nothing you
got nothing dog what's your sniper got
6161 all right six you on take one of
the two that are oh wait the one that's
doing am i merging in back that guy I'm
armed sure coaching again I shouldn't do
that it's so easy to do the scan I know
I know I'm trying to be helpful
I care about what happens yes I've just
renamed or running gun that other bitch
oh well listen there's no need for names
I think when the run goes a bit of a
risk you might run into it I don't run
of a tree and if nothing activates
running gun and killed 38 percent you
want to you missed you'll be flanked and
killed the next Chung it's like me but
you could probably create it with the
other one so it's probably safe to take
that 78 now I should I should mention
this shotguns man have like a bit to hit
bonus the closer you are to something Oh
a nice a lot that's good to know
all right let's move on all right I'm
gonna try shot I'm so sorry for armchair
I just I just do it I'm not even
thinking about and you're probably not
having any fun because I'm a joke
wants to play with your toys but this is
how much I love
XCOM uh-huh dick the birthday boy don't
risk me oh no reason
now race we're going take the birthday
boy you're out here point man all right
we got to move this knife just a lil bit
probably going to have to enter that UFO
sooner or later okay great
move the heavy last
like a second-to-last novice that's not
private gym Simon I ask you can't the
south oh yeah I wasn't even thinking
about it
it just happened rich Evans how much for
a blowjob well I'll let you give me one
for free
nice oh my god nice
okay you board dog yeah but I'm not I'm
also very tired
we're probably gonna head out soon talk
about movies I mean I could but I got
like three hours of sleep last night
get it doc
scanning
J how much for a blowjob no I can't top
riches joke reload on that sniper you
can't can you yeah oh the melting people
best of the worst I forgot about that
did we come up with a third idea
a third movie oh nice at street trash
incredible melting man and then we need
a third melting movie I don't know mmm
is that Chad Walter get your eyes Frosty
the Snowman
does anybody melt and Jack Frost is the
Michael Keaton movie yeah
what's your guys's relationship with doc
of the Dead well we shot some segments
for it very little all said and done
yeah in the final movie most of our
stuff got cut out but it's on Netflix
right now if you want to check it out
but you probably if you should if you're
just checking it out like it don't
bother well they cut all but like a 30
seconds they cut out a lot they cut out
95% of what we shot but it might be on
the eventual blu-ray DVD all the stuff
we shot it was a whole storyline but if
you're really craving a blanket fix you
can see one minute of blanket and doctor
the books right now I think I made it to
the final cut right yeah yeah very
little job there is it play Zombie
Jagger though not the zombie do that
when you're just jogging normally and
the zombies are behind you huh um oh no
for like one shot you see the zombie
jogger
I don't know they chopped it up there's
a little bits here and there they're
still in it but there's there's no
planket storyline anymore what are your
favorite movies from best and worst Oh
mm is that one night all three of them I
mean that was just the deadly bright one
yeah yeah yeah all three of those were
good was that Deadly Prey Miami
connection and her ticket to Hawaii
yeah it was probably the best night
altogether where every movie was
entertaining and three of the best
movies in general yeah probably
yeah I think so else was pretty good
else is pretty good best genuinely best
movie is probably extra for surprise it
was actually a good movie that genuinely
best was thunderpants oh yeah Thunder
pencils pretty good I liked extra more
just because that's an ocean terrific
movie but
now there might be a closed door on the
other side a closed door yeah what is
that
the Flying Saucer will have a closed
door somewhere that's an open exposed or
right so don't know I'm not telling you
will do don't I want just to go in there
I need to go into the UFO to get the gem
I never need to go in there to just kill
things
yes I'm just saying this should be
multiple points of entry I don't know if
you're like waiting to sneak up to go
slow I'm it's not bad yeah well I'm just
getting the dams together yeah yeah you
know what I didn't even think we can
check out what's over here
okay all right we're getting there jams
incredible melting man no that was one
of the ones we want to put on our
melting person episode I haven't seen it
I've seen a clip of it and it looks
horrible floaters why would we do John
Carpenter movies on best of the worst
yes Carpentier usually makes pretty good
movies towards the end of it is his run
not so great but no best of the worst
material I'm just gonna let you know
yeah I believe the floaters can throw
grenades oh it's good to know yeah ooh
Darkstar no I actually I I had never
seen Dark Star John Carpenter's first
movie but I was at Amoeba Records
recently and they had an imported
blu-ray of Dark Star so I picked that up
and I've not watched it yet
I'm curious that's his first movie and
I've never seen it how do you know when
the door is open you can see through it
or you would've been able to shoot the
aliens they're alerted now I don't big
deal sure okay what can these guys
I'm just gonna warn you all she's got
one shot left I'm on shotgun
thank you you are correct
well can I get on the roof yeah I can
get on the roof of the spaceship the
jungle oh my god you guys that's amazing
I mean it's really it's really practical
together it's a roof it's all you got
just get on that room need to get over
here white uh Y flank there inside
you're not gonna flank from over there
no cover everybody everywhere is dancing
I got no cover you know you could do
what could I do
gone through rough go on the roof go to
the other side of the saucer holy shit
no go down now you're talking my
language
we're in the roof yeah where the room
cuz trees don't cut it cuz trees are not
nature's roots that's right fucking
bullshit okay bullshit no I think one
you gotta shut up I don't but - I'm just
checking my options dawg - over here but
yeah well just over a watcher all right
let's do this
alien activity oh that's it is it
probably lying in wait well sure they're
evil I could go in here I wonder if I
could there's two of them in there
I don't involves roofs though oh it
develops ropes
it involves ropes yeah I don't see what
we can do over here no I don't hate
trees you know what they're not roofs
Jay hates all foilage oh oh oh it's
there's a whole rant and a desperate
living above nature and trees stealing
my oxygen I wish I could run as old
monologue it's great I'm fine
both of my jams are here got my sniper
with a good line of sight into the thing
so that's good so she can just hang back
there long is jams here let me take this
you know what I'm gonna do I'm listening
I'm gonna take it slow okay
and what the aliens make a move over
here is Jack and Jill still the worst
movie in the world no because it's not a
movie that I wouldn't even classify it
as a movie so it doesn't yell oh nice
that's all right it's long take it in
you know that's what I'm doing I'm just
taking it slow check and chose not a
movie see how great that sniper have you
have you just called like Jack and Jill
not like I remember there was some
debate as far as like what does it take
to not be a movie but you're just
calling it now I like Jack and Jill is
not a movie yeah yeah that's not a movie
you drop down right next one you can get
that Mel yeah not right next to orders I
just nearly next to it I don't know
looks like it's right it's right next to
it I'm doing it
yes got that Jam I got that Jam all
right it's so tough like I'm the great
belt it oh yeah I know it's so great but
like yeah thinking of no no I got a much
better view huh
you guys are in there and there's always
an overseer
in a UFO - so you have at least two
floaters - sectoid and then overseer in
there's five guys in their goddamn
flying saucer
fucking hell I need you to get in oh
whoa wait we'll see if we can we'll see
if we can snipe anyone else wait oh no
this is just it's just cause you're just
hanging it up okay overwatch okay let's
see what happens
one more one more before we
oh they're doing something in there Jack
I know I know I want to see what's going
on in there I can always run away you
know well okay this is my running Gunnar
okay I got this I got this
I've got battle plans contingencies yeah
I love this shit yeah you know what
I don't what I'm doing fucking camera
around nothing that's all right you go
well how many shots to share okay okay
no targets failure yeah I know we got we
got shots on the shotgun - I'm Bob on
the machine gun there's a question named
to me but it's more for you rich yeah
what's the story with Gamestation why
did it only run a few episodes because
of his experimental in the first place
we tried it and I didn't like doing it
it was kind of weird having nobody to
play off of nobody to converse with and
get feedback from cuz young doing Mike
and Jay were filming me with the camera
but they didn't know anything about
video games so I'm like does this sound
interesting and they're like sorry
there was it was a pilot I mean I was
never in wait I'm watching what happens
here this thing
Oh still life oh damn
Oh running away Oh running gun away and
maybe you could at least kill wow those
guys oh sure
oh my god okay okay be safe
yeah no I mean we it was meant as like a
test yeah there wasn't some people
because that was right around the same
time that we were putting the half of
the bag episodes on machinima so I think
some people polled thought that we were
doing Gamestation for Michelle no we
weren't we were just doing it for
ourselves as though you know just to try
something new
Shemp her name oh you did do you need a
rag on together um because she does she
have - what does this knife we have sha
twice I got some shots 70 100 % I could
take out a floater that's not bad
do the just in case do the headshot I
don't think you'll need it but don't
feel like take chances ah I know which
one which one well can anybody else
shoot anything
what about things like that Ricky by the
tree stump oh yeah 30 hey he's got one
oh you know what he's down on help all
right
somehow no that's that's the most you
could conceivably get oh and it flashes
like that yeah fuck that
okay so here's over deal and so we do
take out one of these jams take a 71 you
take 100 I know that's one of those
great XCOM decisions
will you guys do the 48 hour film thing
again probably not the last one we did
we realized that it just felt like we
were doing more work is at that point we
were probably to stuff all the time
anyway and it was like this is just more
work so probably not you took jets and I
did it and paid off all right all right
right that's the thing like making
Internet videos is basically doing the
48 hour film festival all the time yeah
yeah
so it's to then make another movie on
top of that all this kind of like a
complete waste of time I know I know
what's your what's your heavy guy can
you move your honey just somewhere work
she can get up shut the won it back no
no I just moved the heavy last time this
term yeah you've already moved her yeah
she can't see anything oh she's done
yeah she's got now so so like yeah the
48 hour film festival is is really fun
by the way it was fun the first couple
of years now the third year he just was
stressful I mean it was kind of fun um
but it was more stressful than anything
I know I used my running gun but I feel
more couple running gunning away yeah we
ever attend another convention probably
eventually when space cops done maybe
well we'll do some conventions but wait
because shot won't oh well shit I guess
I can't know
there you go
who's the third guy in the dude bros
that was damn he's a friend of mine he
moved out of out of Milwaukee though so
that's why he's not did anything anymore
hey nice nice okay all right
he moved where he's in karma no no okay
yeah so if I killed the one yeah good
one giving or the one getting the one
giving okay oh nice oh shit okay it's
okay
is it oh yeah totally is okay okay
why 67% floaters when they will heavy
some kind of bad aim to begin with and
floaters get like a defense just for
being flight sure so I get where this is
a 20 there can I get a better if I move
can I get a better you might be able to
grenade I don't like that at all well
yeah grenade I'd rather now you'd move
in grenade you know that would do it
yeah yes your sniper have a bead on
what's good thing to check yeah I'm
gonna return he right you are right
anything nope okay Oh get out here get
out of here okay all right I got this
get out of here yeah where is pork pork
in space it's on the red letter media
archive volume 1 DVD
don't pretend your soul don't microwave
let's go besides everyday I'm gonna
grenade a pork pork in space like for
parking space I'm happy with that movie
that was one of those things I had an
idea I did all came together very
quickly in my mind I knew exactly what I
wanted and then we made it
jealousy the one
but are you you're not anything
aalverson oh okay yeah you're not
anything um I can get the back one but
it's a 41% chance instead of a 51%
chance I either way I'm not happy but
you know what I could do is Grenada both
yep because these are the last two guys
for all we know
oh shit dog there could be somebody out
in the woods that's true any other XCOM
games you recommend classic and I like
the new one I'm not a fan at all of the
bureau or any of the other weird and
spin-offs they did with XCOM back in the
day like the what was it executioner
wearing there's third person shooter one
I don't know I haven't played the I
actually haven't played terror in the
deep which is the expansion pack for
XCOM one and I forget where the full
secret was called III I haven't played
