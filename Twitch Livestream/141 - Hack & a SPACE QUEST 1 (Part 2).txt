um I had gotten a couple suggest a full
first rich say hi hey what's up there is
what it sounds perfect
you guys okay rich they testing one two
three
it's true whenever whenever we do tests
I always tell rich to say I say rich
testing one two and rich goes Noah
testing one two three
but I I think the three is redundant
[Laughter]
[Music]
we've gotten some requests
[Laughter]
I tried we tried using mumble we we got
a couple suggestions to try out mumble
for us talking and they said that would
work a little bit better better quality
and it's true I heard rich much better
on mumble the only problem was somehow I
was hearing an echo for me and it wasn't
Rich's speakers like rich had headphones
on and so I heard a constant echo on
mumble so obviously we couldn't have me
echoing throughout the entire stream so
we just went back to Skype because we
were running late because we were trying
to get mumble to work teamspeak I hear
good things but do you have to pay for
teamspeak well what is it what do you
know about it whiplash games games Oh
whiplash games is that is a yeah I'm
looking at a review comp which says only
three people are in this room which is
wrong that's well I'm I'm sorry I'm
sorry I was distracted okay well where's
our where's our mods team speedo
teamspeak is free okay well then you
know what we will look into that we will
absolutely look into that also where's
our mods to tell us if no well 20 place
Pokemon mumble didn't work for us I was
getting a constant echo
yeah we tried we tried and and we got on
our server we gotta you know one of
their servers and it was just rich and I
on there but I always heard an echo and
I couldn't find a workaround in time so
but okay we'll try teamspeak yeah well
can you guys hear rich this is the
question
testing one two three one two three
testing one two three okay well they're
saying they can hear you now so that's
good and I have turned you up even more
rich okay sounds crystal clear now
there's a great great crystal clear okay
we need to go back to a save game here
okay so space quickly used face quest
six here we are we're right here so
don't go left okay so oh yeah how we
enhance your here we are in hints
because apparently there's something in
tea here right so let me let me try it
now that I know that there's something
here right there are two things oh my
god yeah the pod seems semi destroyed
look
Anton II struction that's I I don't I
think it's a glitch I don't know that
there's even a hint for it but I mean
there's no I mean there's no hint here
cuz I say look at pod and it says it's
semi destroyed right yeah oh wait look
around pod are you sure you want to look
at that look at look around it's not
compute look around is you seem to be
located in an incredibly remote area
there is a thrashed escape pod here and
then you look at pod and it's a semi
destroyed right so there's there's
nothing else here I tried looking at pod
I I know that but I know that's not
right right
look at Olin trade ground yeah Rock
instruction yeah I tried okay look at
ground it's quite sandy down there
there's no hint at all for I got that's
a terrible puzzle alright okay so what's
the puzzle here oh wait hold on wait
wait look I want to say look at damage I
don't understand damage nope okay so
there's glass on the ground there's
glass you need to pick up look at glass
just take get glass or take glass you
don't see that here Oh get him right in
front of the pod maybe that's behind it
in front where the window is what oh
because it was fate I can't oh I can
okay take glass glass is now in position
okay look at waiting no yeah that's a
terrible puzzle there's no way I would
have ever known there was glass here and
you say there's one there's one other
thing here there's one other thing okay
what's what is it cuz obviously there's
nothing else that I can do here like
there's no hints you can't solve the
puzzle if they don't give you any hints
rich oh I'm pretty sure I'm right about
there being a something under that seat
but we can we can go on if you want
after that
hold on sir trace search pod Wow l
decided I don't undercook a wait and go
and pod oh no what happened was that
what happened oh I think I was in the
same area for too long and that spider
drone was coming back I'm back inside
the pod
[Laughter]
if you sir no I did search and it didn't
show me glass
you saw me search um
their pod I don't understand your
requests look around time you get kit
get it
done yeah all right sorry jack
there is a kit there's a survival kit
I'm sorry well how was I supposed to
know that I know I know
no don't don't be sorry about that that
would like it's one of those things
where it's like how was I supposed to
come to that conclusion
oh no I'm running spider bot suddenly
you see a large black metal sphere
falling out of the sky
a Syrian spider drawing upon touching
down on the planet's surface it sprouts
legs and begins its search for you you
recall from an article in space piston
magazine oh Jesus Chris okay okay oh I
thought if I left the screen yeah it
would okay I gotta keep on I gotta move
faster
okay that's a fine that's fine restore
Thanks okay
enter pod so so now how am I supposed to
find the kid this is the question in
their head it's possible because I was a
kid I actually didn't end up I don't
know if I did you didn't read the
manuals I was a kid or if I don't know
where it wasn't what but it might be an
anti-piracy thing some of these games
had valuable information in the manuals
now look I would read it I read the
manual you would know about something
that you should get if you just pirate
the game so by the way I say look under
the seat and it says there's nothing
under the seat so this is just something
I'm supposed to know okay so I took the
kid look at it this is your survival kit
contains a xena an Army knife and a can
of dehydrated water dehydrated water
that's a funny joke leave pod okay
take glass you can't see that here all
right I need to get in front
look pod oh okay is you need to get in
front of the pod and then look at the
pod the pod seems to be seven destroyed
a glimmering a glimmering catches your
eye upon closer inspection you see that
a piece of highly reflective glass has
broken out of the pod window okay oh
[Music]
wait wait wait stop
f5 yes save face West Oh
six no of 707 see I want to do nothing
but gush over this game and there's
something that happens and I I feel bad
well you know it's it was a different
time
it was a different time okay here we go
uh let's stop here let's look around you
are at the southwest edge of a meza it's
very desolate here great doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo walk in is to walk in
walk in by some rocks gonna keep walking
nope and I'll look around there might be
a space you get through down a little
bit oh right
that's actually that's a really weird
thing is like the mixture of real
controls and typing controls yeah yeah
look around you are in a desert cliff
area there is a natural land bridge in
the distance ooh
bridge is probably important bridge is
quite unique natural formation carved
out though eons of the elements it does
not appear to be accessible from here
okay
well let's go that way then let's go
towards the land bridge oh wait can I
climb over here can I climb these rocks
there's probably a ramp somewhere
there's more screens you can go to yeah
oh okay I want to see if I can go over
here and like Lime Rock you cannot climb
the cliffs or rocks okay that's good to
know
then let's go this way doo doo doo doo
doo oh there we go
easy peas going up the ramp yeah oh no
that's fighter droid and is here running
away suddenly yep
okay run run run dude it to do getting
out of here look around
oh no the spiders Royden damn he's down
there I don't think I can get at you I
think you're safe oh good
we're following a path okay yeah get out
of here spider droid goddamn spider
droid always up in my biz what's neat
though I like the spider droid mm-hmm
yeah but he's all up in my business role
and bridge yeah okay oh oh oh no there's
some plant lifes underneath me Oh No
okay I'll save base quest Oh eight
there's some it says there's plants
underneath me rich I might have needed
those plants Oh a crack formed in the
bridge look at bridge I think you can
only walk over at a limited number of
times sure that save is important okay
Rock there's a very large rock on the
Natural Bridge look under rock pick
Barack leave the rock alone okay I'll
leave fine that's fine
what's over here not much
do-do-do-do-do going over here Oh a
spider you seem to be safe seem to be
safe know that spiders probably there
for a reason right well to keep me
moving right yeah we're back in the area
where I don't quite remember all the
puzzles so yeah that doesn't flow seems
to stretch to infinity okay
looking around Oh anything going behind
a thing there are some things i
generally remember some things I just
don't
[Laughter]
sure sure sure
oh here's something you are high atop a
rocky plateau near two halves of an arch
the desert below seems to stretch into
an infinity let's go look at that arch
that's definitely definitely oh my god a
secret portal rich a secret portal we
are underground it happened it happened
look around this is one end of what
appears to be a large cavern the only
way to go is to the left there is a rock
nearby oh they like rocks apparently we
got to go look at that rock hold on look
at Rock it looks just like a well I
don't pick up rock done okay
you have rock I have a rock now great
okay here we go or walk in shit look
around this is another large chamber in
the uh no I need to save there is
there's a path on the back of the wall
which is not accessible from the bottom
good instinct yes it's quest Oh nein
okay now I'm not gonna walk over this
great I will tell you that you shaved
right there okay look at at first yeah
try not to die right the great is made
of metal and seems to be fastened
securely to the floor it is too dark to
see down through the grate there is
however an odd smell emanating from down
there
all right well let's walk over groan oh
god you've been snatched from existence
by a tentacled beast lurking beneath the
great you feel the painful sting of
digestive fluids thank you for playing
space quest that's my favorite part
yeah wow it's just like yep you're done
now restore Oh nein what what can we do
to get past this monster well obviously
we take the rock right that was our most
recent get it's not necessarily the most
recent good the solution to these okay
how do I so we have the cartridge a
gadget the glass an Army knife a rock a
keycard dehydrated water and a survival
kit so my instinct is to like throw the
rock to distract it but we could also
use the glass maybe it's reflective know
that would happen let's throw a rock use
what's that what's that vent on the
other side - I don't remember the
solution I'm not guiding you really
don't let's see here there's a path in
the back wall that is not okay um look
at steam I'm not close enough look at
rate there's an odd smell emanating from
down there so we know there's a tentacle
monster I'm gonna use rock
that is currently not one of your
options if you try something you might
want to be more specific about what you
sure that I want to throw Rock silly
human that would not be helpful well
shit how do we get past the tentacle
monster oh can you can you walk in a
different spot of the great yeah maybe
if I walk down here nope nope yeah be a
bit sharp you've been snatched from
existence by a tentacle monster restore
okay okay let's think about this rich we
have glass we have a rock we have a
survival kit we have dehydrated water
mmm
no be here use water that's not
currently one of your options cartridge
a gadget a gadget is like a translator
we have the glass we have an army knife
rock keycard dehydrator water survival
kit hmm
[Music]
Roah rock at steam I don't know
Oh bro rock at em say what okay that's
not it okay that's not it
so the path is not accessible Oh 100
maybe if I get all the way up on it no
whoa oh okay that's how that was thing
that's how you do it that's how you do
it it worked
thing worked great okay look at steam
there is a geyser cone here and it is
rhythmically spewing hot steam so I
could probably put the rock in there
right put rock on steam punk oh there we
go that's weird
Oh what was that
what's drip oh that's like dripping
water that's worried look around this is
a slightly smaller chamber in the
underground complex there is a path
above which is not accessible from here
there's a pool to the right on the right
side okay let's go to that pool
look at pool you gaze intently at the
purplish pool of liquid the first real
sign of moisture on the planet the pool
seems to have no bottom but gentle
dripping has a soothing effect on your
frazzled nerves okay
you know what we should do what we
should probably save yes this crest ten
okay okay
so obviously it's liquid so use be
hydrated water oh I can't spell
dehydrated the hide hated
but water how would you like to do that
would it water pool that does not
compute okay that's fine can you get the
water water you have nothing that could
successfully contain the liquid ah
so maybe this is a comeback - it might
be ed my leash there's a lot of thing
there's a lot of comeback dudes in these
games chair what I just wanna see what
happens if we splash water I don't
understand splash okay all right that's
fine drink drink what oh my god that
would kill us right well let's see what
happens probably drink water are we
saved nearby yeah you place your lips to
the nozzle and draw a fluid not a very
reasonable facsimile of water is
released slowly while tasting slightly
terrible it quenches your thirst at
least for the time being
oh no I think I drink my dehydrated
water drink water drink a pool they want
okay okay
drink water from pool I don't understand
your guys okay well hopefully we don't
need air okay let's get out of here
I think there's an exit over here yeah
that looks like a cave yeah let's go
back here let's go back here spaceman
or not
mmm I try going to your lips Oh God
oh okay nope up where am I
you're behind that rock it's gotta be a
thing back there you would think there'd
be a thing back there you can't go all
the way to your love I don't know where
okay come on I'm just walking to my left
now nothing's happening oh jesus oh
Jesus Christ that is loud so hold on we
have to turn that sound off for a second
cuz that's annoying f2 f2 oh god that's
terrible that was a terrible sound okay
sorry everybody about that um okay so
now oh here we go I know what to do here
the first we look around you are in a
large room in the cavern there is a
pathway above at the south end of the
room are two odd-looking units emitting
beams of light use glass on beams oh say
what okay never mind try to get closer
look at the beams seemed to form some
sort of electronic a barrier across the
path glass beams they want keep keep it
simple just try use glasses you confuse
it when you when you elaborate sure oh
yeah you're right that works okay okay
you have quite cleverly turned the beam
upon itself frying it to inoperability
sweet right alright now we can turn the
sound back on good thing for that for
that sweet blipping and bloopin that's
what we need some sweet blipping and
bloopin action
hi we're on the path now let's go doo
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
doo - Doo Space Quest
we're play space quest it's the first
base quest and I'm walking in okay Oh No
what acid water ah damn it
when did we save last well I guess we'll
find out now so hopefully now okay we
got a that's okay we're not too far away
oh you know what I think this saved me
from drinking the dehydrated water no
good okay
quest we are playing space quest where
things can kill you at any moment
oh god damn it sound hold on guys we
know how to deal with this look at beams
just use glass you can't get closer
okay jesus H Christ
great you know what save these quest 11
dude all right
space quick space a space quit I don't
know if you want to try anything game
we're about halfway there I may be a
little under half way are we really
looking for short
well I'm forgetting about a section so
maybe a little more than that maybe
group
okay Oh cut damn it hold on thank you
for playing space quest how do we get
around these acid beams
this is the important part
in a survival kit I don't think that
would help us though
if only we had an acid umbrella
the edge is very important
you
okay hold on we're gonna go over here
look round
thanks s on a pool or right-hand side
look drops oh wrench yeah we lost it
what what happened we lost the stream
you lost the stream no other people
saying it froze
oh well then hold on a refreshing stream
how is my audio chat if you can hear us
the important question did my internet
die well you wouldn't be talking to me
if it died
sure okay no now the stream should be
back saying I'm good
someone did okay one person thinks I
sound good okay good okay okay good good
good alright we should be able to see my
mouse waving around if you can see my
mouse waving around then we know we've
done good I'm refreshing the page now so
I'll tell you in a second okay
yes okay I see okay great
so now I need to figure out how to get
around the ass the dripping acid water
this is my spring sorry can you screen
share with me again oh yeah yeah we're
not screeching sure hold on a second
pause pause in the game screen sharing
with rich where are you right here and
then we go like this go like this and we
go like this okay
we are screen sharing all right all
right back in here I need to figure out
how to get around these drips rich tried
timing I don't owe in Siddhant only just
out of curiosity we did the disabled was
after the water drinker before do we
have the dehydrated water stole I'm just
curious
we have the dehydrated water okay okay
but you think this might be just a
timing thing
it might be I don't recall this is one
of those things I just don't remember
the answer to some of these processes
sure nope you got further than you did
I did get further than I did yes all
right I think it's gonna be annoying
yeah okay is it just one of those things
it might be I'd save right there
right try and do it okay we're gonna
we're gonna make a new space class 11
safe in which we are right there yeah
thank West okay here we go here we go
walking death 13 jag zero yeah yeah yeah
Savin great
all right we're saving right here then
we'll just wait for this one trip to
drip and stop and then wait for the
other one what a pain in the ass
nope damn it too close too close that's
okay well no we're right here now so
it's okay they were right here then how
does it work drip drip drip yeah oh oh
it's got it has like slightly different
timing can I'd like go back here you can
probably stop between them chair
and
save no I got this I got this I made it
I made it I got it now I'm with it
here we go let's look around
another large chamber there is an
underground complex oh it's a pass it
back but you know what we should do we
should save
we should save now that we're through it
new Space Quest 11 save great cuz
nothing much happened okay here we go
walking around one drip and it's all
over that's right people
that's this a lesson of life right there
Oh as soon as you enter the room when
you find yourself surrounded by darkness
suddenly you become aware of the fact
that you cannot move or speak
a strange unknown force has taken over
what oh my god a massive holographic
image appears before you you sense that
you are the only life-form in the area
the geogebra is of sig figs
ciao willful Zek we called 11e while
firms revering
[Music]
oh okay check didn't didn't you find a
translator you're totally right can i I
can't type anything yet
Oh No I can't type oh here we go because
of your inability to understand the
aliens language he has sent you back to
the surface
Oh No Oh what reload just reloading
urine reload nerd rather than going
through all that shit again yeah yeah
dreams and we're reconnecting we're here
we're here
yeah that's weird
yeah it can't be your internet because
you're still able to talk to me ya know
it's maybe it's just the twitch servers
are acting funny tonight okay hold on
look at translate or written on the
electronic gadget are the words dialect
translator on one end is a dial and a
light currently dim dial huh turn turn
divert yeah yeah turn dial on
anslee or you turn the dial to the light
the to the right the light begins to
glow fucking thing now yeah great
as soon as you into the room you find
yourself here here we go a massive
holographic image oh we've been here
before
[Music]
so you have found your way to my
hallowed chamber I have been monitoring
your travels on our planet it appears
that you are up to the proverbial s to
tarry well without a means of locomotion
what
of the creek without a paddle you are
obviously in need of transportation
let us see if you are worthy of our
assistance
okay okay I'm worthy I'm worthy on the
surface lives a beast called oriT he
proves to be a bit of an annoyance on
occasion dispose of him and bring back
evidence of your conquests only then
will I deal with your plight good luck
strange one okay okay
rot so we need to kill alright okay I
can only assume that's the sand worm
well let's get out of here so we go back

just gonna tell me what to do and we
can't do this what are you talking about

way come here who wrought you sons of
bitch
[Laughter]
okay there's the there's the tower thing
let's see what's this way to do oh no
this is gonna be another scene where
wasn't it probably okay we don't want to
go there then let's see what's over here
oh the heat is causing you to develop
quite a thirst drinking of water is
certainly most pleasant oh okay great
hold on I know what to do you uh drink
water
yes great all right I knew we were gonna
need that right isn't that's it like
that's an adventure game thing is you
need to use all the things if you have a
thing eventually you'll need to use it
okay walking this way
what's over here what's over here oh
nothing come on over I way what's this
that looks like something look around oh
it's a rather bleak environment whoo
here we go these plants I think it
mentioned these plants before I remember
this I remember this look at plants it
looks a lot like spinach okay I mean
plant you tell
off a piece of the plant okay nice no no
if you eat it you probably dies all
right Ryan
oh now can I look and plan it's a plant
you are not familiar with oh great so
what if you rot is the sandworm and you
have to give it the plan well you want
to try doing that Jack I should say
first is that what you're saying you can
I'm pretty sure that we're at is not the
same thing
well then I'm gonna save but you should
always say always save always be saving
unless it's right before you die you can
fuck yourself over sure all right let's
go over here has rich won the boss fight
against the coffee look I told you guys

and it did it did yeah I just died oh
did the war meet you that were made me
okay okay luckily though I just saved
right before this okay going back not

here I thought I saw a cave I asked you
stop okay yeah I think the rocks right I
think that's a cave okay let's go over
there
you think that's a cave I guess it could
be it looks like there's some curvy
things in there a different color it
looks like an entrance you don't remove
these things over here oh I'll try that

yeah that's not very clear but okay yeah
I mean you're right oh go oh who run oh
[Music]

thank you for playing space quest okay
going back yes yeah it's good we know
where he is I just need to press use
plants faster if it is plants or maybe
it's knife I have a knife yeah look at
your inventory think about what you have
all right well let me get closer first
I'll save to save us from walking
because I'm gonna die again good that's
how it works
Oh probably I'm glad you have such
confidence in me okay
here we go the caves of all rot we are
here at the caves of ooo rot alright
save and you might you know what
whatever you want to do you might want
to have it typed out and ready to go
before you walk into the cave can you do
that
yeah oh my god okay we have if you hit
ever - it also redoes the last thing
you'd like oh sure okay we have a
cartridge with a keycard dehydrated
water Army knife gadget glass plant
survival kit alright use plant is what
I'm gonna say here and we're gonna see
if that works
how do you save yeah okay would you like
to do oh crap exit the cave and fry
again sure nope get out of here okay how
do you spell over odd is that ORAC 18
okay you rot plant okay let's try that
but you want to do with a plan shut up
is what I want to do with the plan that
does not compute god damnit what have we
here oh and yeah and he's killing me
what do you mean that does not compute
you get us you're trying to give this
violent coniferous monster and plant yes
nothing about that computes and well I
have a plan rich nice yeah
you trying to kill the monster with a
plant I just don't understand you jack
cuz I thought maybe he was just hungry
and he wanted it planned hold on look at
knife this is a handy-dandy
yeah see I can't you can't kill anyone
with this knife yeah yeah I am rich hold
on survival kit um look at yet rival kid
it's for my container Xena I'm a knife
and I can't even have you oh so it's
just an empty container that's do we
have your dehydrated water I mean I'm
gonna go out of my way not to give you
any help here jack don't give me any
help here well I'm not any hope what can
I do here I mean I could I could whip
out the knife but of course yeah he'll
just like laugh at me I mean I could mix
the plant and the water inside the
survival kit to make a soup and maybe
that's what he wants
maybe he hasn't want he doesn't want
just a plan he wants a soup and sews
like maybe that's it
you're gonna mix a plant with dehydrated
water I listen as a suit you can throw
that you could try that I could but I
could do that okay hold on okay I'm
trying to
how can type us out now like it's
obviously not just used knife it has to
be like use knife on errata or something
you know slash gujrat with knife try it
not slash right I'm not telling you
anything that wouldn't work so okay i'm
gonna happen I'm out of the loop here
this is Jack it's fun adventure puzzle
time exactly okay I'm just gonna try use
knife and see what happens
oh wait no what actually I should look
around first the knife wouldn't cut hot
and margarine oh good Hughes I'm gonna
here's what I'm gonna do
look around so I'm gonna go in there I'm
gonna look around and that'll buy me
some time you are in the sly Mia stuff
calves the odor in here is less than
desirable I'm gonna slimy cave and the
odor is less than desirable okay well
that doesn't any good this wouldn't help
you ultimately but you could go in and
just have already look at or add see if
that'll tell you anything I don't know
that it will because this is not a hint
I swear sure Oh rat is huge and ugly of
course your opinion may differ depending
on what part of the university who come
from it should also be mentioned he is
quite mean well shit getting out of here
okay okay big and ugly and quite mean
mm-hmm and don't look at chat and I'm
not mean oh my in fact I've closed my
laptop I can't I can't look at the chat
even if I wanted to okay so they've
already looked at the walkthroughs
they've already given up of course of
course listen this is a game people this
is the fun of the game
so here's um we have the glass right
here's me thinking outside of the box we
have the guy
and it mentioned that erat was ugly so
what if I used the glass to reflect rotz
image on himself use its can't ya use
glass we'll try that okay ready
use glass what would you how would you
like to do that oh god damn it look chat
I don't care if you looked at a
walkthrough or if you remember it from
when you were a kid it's still spoiling
it for ya
either way it's the same rot wait how do
you spell true right again eighty or
eighty all right show a rat glass this
is what we're gonna try and Joe or a
glass Oh nope doesn't understand Oh
goddamn it
alright nevermind yeah yeah okay no
that's fine now you know what that was -
outside of the box and I knew that I
knew that going in so we got a plant we
got a survival kit okay here's what
we're gonna try yeah use knife on plant
say what nope okay what plants in it's
like can we combine things say what is
is there combining of things to be done
sometimes I don't know there is in this
case okay cuz I have a kit and it's an
empty kit they used to have dehydrated
water and a knife in it but now it's
just an empty kit but that I mean that
could be nothing
you know just finding it was I'm not
gonna say anything until you asked me to
know and all I'm trying to do now I'm
just trying to like kind of the show a
math you know I'm trying to talk you
through my mental process here it's like
I've already used the glass so are we
ruling out the glass is something useful
right that's the question
the knife is the knife useful but no I
mean obviously
I won't work on him because we tried
that and it didn't work what else do we
have
we have cartridge a keycard a gadget a
glass a plant a survival kit Army knife
and dehydrated water mix water I don't
understand mix use water on that plant I
don't understand your request okay um
look at knife Indiana Xena an Army knife
so it has different things in it and has
like a can opener come on come on brain
hola we're just gonna look around around
the slimy astakhov's oh wait hold on
okay hold on pick up slime I don't
understand slime come on
I mean this slimy cave you jerk
[Music]
okay plan this is and yeah this is like
this is the problem with these types of
games is usually like it especially
something like this it's stuck you get
stuck and it has to be something very
specific it has to be exactly what the
developers wanna say yeah and so like I
have a I have the gadget but I can't
imagine I mean I've already used again I
guess I could yell at a rod do you think
that would work if I yell at say what
notebook it
nope oh wait I'm gonna try looking look
maybe I missed something with with what
looking at who Ron was okay blue rod is
huge and ugly course your opinion may
differ depending on what part of the
universe you come from it should also be
mentioned he is quite mean mm-hmm
over here nope nothing nothing
okay I thought maybe there's like a
different part of the cave I could go
into okay okay what can we do here rich
what can we do here I know and it's it's
tough because he can't give me any clues
I know I know I'm being completely
silenced till you ask for something you
know hints or whatever right no I don't
even want a hint because as soon as you
as soon as you give me a hint I'll get
it right away and that won't be any fun
but I have the culture I have the
cartridge but I mean there's nothing to
use the cartridge in I asked I have the
Army knife I have the survival kit but
why don't you just look at everything in
your inventory and just see yeah you get
the idea right
don't you like to do that um open kit
this is your survival kit it formerly
contained a xenon Army knife in a Canada
hydrator order okay so that's just an
empty container um use knife this knife
wouldn't cut up margarine knife on the
plant they what fake off ailment Oh Oh
Matt right Edie naked oops
[Laughter]
naked I don't understand naked okay I
might have also spelled make it wrong
damn it rich
okay okay
try to be try to try to just I the hint
that I want from you is not a hint on
the game just try to try to give me a
hint in in the world of text adventure
games what am I missing here what am I
missing that would just be a commonplace
in a text adventure game that I'm not
privy enough to understand you know I
don't I don't know that I can tell you
something like that you know is there is
there a very ambiguous and it's simple
am I am I missing something
it's simple and you could do it with
what you have on you now okay with what
I have on me now the answers are in your
inventory the answers are in my
inventory okay yes great great great and
you you have not been close yet well
yeah okay here's what I'm gonna do okay
I'm gonna throw my knife at him okay
here he comes oh not yet no you run away
here he comes and throw knife the knife
wouldn't cut hutton margarine no no were
you hoping he might die from him an
infected bruise yes yes I was yeah bro
glass is all we're gonna try next
that does not compute no okay all right
I mean well what what else have oh come
first of all I typed that before you
subscribed I want it noted that I typed
that before you subscribed
I want that noted for the record books
you son of a bitch you plant your teeth
into the strange plants and take a large
bite only to fine to taste exquisitely
bad if you had your choice you would
choose any other form of death over the
meal like this Oh does that kill me no
oh wait do I still have the plant now
what why do I have the plant wait a
minute you do still have the plant I
mean I ate it but I still have it yeah
okay so they're getting that whole thing
got you off-track it did what did that
plant thing well oh damn it it got me
off
well great don't subscribe with the
answer people or else I will turn off
that sub learn okay
okay I mean in in my head it has
something to do with the plants because
the plant is right there right are you
asking me asking me are you rhetorically
asking myself
I'm rhetorically asking myself and so in
my head the plants is right there it was
a recent pickup it mentioned the plants
and now we have a new enemy and so like
using the plant I mean can I just throw
the plant grow plants I know I mean I'm
in a throat cake now but this is all I
got well okay okay
it's nope that would not be helpful okay
this is just where I am
I look at plant in class does it involve
doing jump jack is just throwing
everything he has at the problem right
okay rich here's my question to you
does it involve doing something with an
item before I go into the cave like do I
need to mix or combine an item before I
go into the cave
no dammit no mixing or combining no
mixing or combining okay um I mean water
Oh Oh rot always in the mood for a snack
snatches up the can out of the air with
his spacious oral cavity chews and
swallows it he notices a rumbling deep
within his abdomen
did that work oh okay oh it's dehydrated
water
it's the Hydra oh all right sighs proved
to be bigger than his stomach for once
and capable of becoming history's first
living reservoir his body succumbs to
the intense internal pressure created by
nearly ten gallons of instantly
reconstituted water great excellent
I killed ooh how are you feeling about
this experience now do I now that I beat
that puzzle I feel great about it but
that took a while I know I know
but I like I got on there I got on to
the throwing path I got on to the you
know we did it I'm upset that the plant
didn't have anything to do with it but
that's fine well you just happened to
find it right before him but that didn't
mean anything
Ryan you could have found it much
earlier you could have thought it later
right okay I just want to make sure oh
look look around yeah look around is the
same thing you're in the slime use of
caves and odor in here is less than Adam
then desire but can I take well we need
we need we need the proof that oh this
looks like it might be a thing that's
right we proof yeah this looks like
something no I don't need to go all the
way back only to come back here so tell
you that much take chunk you reach down
and take the or a part in your hand as
some of it eases to fill the space
between your fingers great okay we got
the chunk to be to be fair check that
wasn't that that was not what that was
not the best adventure game puzzle the
throw the water at all right yeah
oh no no you know that's well well I
mean you know it that was that what that
was something that we got earlier
right we got that yeah with the knife
and and it's an unusual bit of thing to
do not it's not a brilliant puzzle
because it didn't give you any any clues
right the best puzzle kind of gives you
ambiguous clues then you use your your
mighty your mighty brain to figure it
out yeah that was more trial and error
use that all the things we have on all
the things we have until one of the
things we have works but I'll take it
you know what I should do I should save
[Laughter]
great great all right here we go here we
go we're a walk in each plant you
chatters thank you each plant for
subscribing I do I just also think that
it's comical that I typed in each plant
just as as you were trying to fake it
give me that hint oh I think I only have
like one more walk across this bridge I
[Laughter]
think you do
yeah okay here we go doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo I love his walk cycle like
his sideways walk cycle oh yeah it's a
little derp and it's my favorite look
you know the characters a little derp
yeah he's he's a space janitor and I get
in through the secret entrance over here
no no that would be nice that would take
me right to the head now I got to go
through all the jams again hey you
already know how to get through the jams
they're already taken care yeah I know
fine yeah you know what this is rich its
filler that's what this is but it's fine
this is I want to I want to say the
technical term for this is back tracking
going through a previously explored area
for the sole purpose of extending the
time of a game still a fun experience
[Music]
this is the sound effects that would
give this terrible I know we didn't
really watch the the video game awards
uh-huh
but somebody sent me a link that Ken and
Roberta Williams were on it they are the
people who actually founded Sierra the
company okay
married competent married couple who
just made King's Quest and kept making
other games and made money at it and I
was really happy to know that they're
still together you know they're probably
like divorced and hate each other by now
team started the company together yeah I
wonder how much they hate each other but
no I saw a little clip in YouTube they
seem very happy stole my heart oh that's
good
that's good no you know it's it's all
fine I have not seen anything of those
video games orders except for I mean I
did watch the new Zelda footage and you
know it looks a lot like the old Zelda
except with the horse yeah I mean it
looks great you know looks pretty it
looks next to Jenny and they were just
talking about how like the horse makes
it so you don't run into trees
who gives a shit I will be excited if
the open world is one large open world
and not a series of like you know
largest rooms with one or two who enters
and exits mmm like the entrance to
Hyrule Field and Hyrule Field is just
like a big area so it's just like an
open giant fucking forest and fields its
turn into deserts that'd be great yeah
that'd be great mm-hmm I agree with you
if it if it's more open if we can do
things out of order oh that's right let
this thing
and no chat I did not see any of safe I
did not see any of the the the no man's
sky videos from the VGA that was the one
where you could like take off alien
planet fly to another alien planet and
right get out yeah what did save right I
did save what I was in between okay all
right we got it this time we got it I
got through no I don't I don't care for
that for that kind of hype I don't care
for that kind of advertisement that's
all it is it's an advertisement you know
what it is there's someone's a few of
the things they advertise I'm interested
in but Jer and this is some some more
shit from Arkham Knight and Oh God
not it looks like the terrible Batmobile
the game yeah
[Music]
okay I'm back at the head so you have
returned fortunately there is much more
to you than meets the eye
but before me your proof of yachts
defeat for my inspection show what is it
called again gujrat part okay
drop rod part you drop the rod part to
you the ground the vision is silent you
are startled by a rumbling and suddenly
an oddly shaped door comes into view
you hear voice different this time
beckoning you to step forward
doo-doo-doo-doo by on his floor well he
told me - oh oh oh it's very oh the
Wizard of Oz is here please don't be
alarmed we intend no harm we are a
peaceful race we are cautious however
others don't share our way of life
welcome to Corona you are standing in
the power generation facility of our
underground settlements all power here
is produced by steam this is unimportant
to you however we have promised you
transportation great it is a skimmer it
hovers approximately 1/2 meter above the
traveling surface this is very important
because of growl Oh surely a worm growl
and is like dwell in caves below the
sand if you stand on the surface too
long you chance to become Righton the
skimmer is programmed to take you to a
settlement on the other side of Corona
called Uhlans flats you can make further
travel arrangements there I'm sorry this
is all we can offer I hope your trip
save great look around this place is
most interesting indeed a mixture of
both old and new technologies
