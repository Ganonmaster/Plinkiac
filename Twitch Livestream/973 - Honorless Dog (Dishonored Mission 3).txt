there's game Shorter's quake ever I
needed some deep just had some chips
that's what I had
by the every citizens duty to report
treasonous speech and actions the state
depends on you
we're yet rillette Havelock Hamrlik
hello Corvo I expect Martin will be
joining us shortly I hate to start your
day with such a strange matter but the
servants heard something last night
moving through the storm drains beneath
the building most likely a weeper the
poor bastard there's no hope for them
with the plague that's that far along
nothing more than a shuffling corpse
full of sickness and insects if you ask
me I'd appreciate you investigating just
to be sure it's not a nosy Guardsman
that's getting too close
here's a key to the hatches I'd send a
servant down there but they die of fear
on the spot on the frame maybe Pierrot
can concoct some sort of sleep poison
for your crossbow if you want to go that
bit pro all stinks says hey rich this is
my first tip ever I want to save some
questions for when jack is around too
but for future reference if I tip
multiple times in one stream do you guys
answer multiple questions
yeah well answer multiple questions but
we we don't guarantee we'll read every
tip
and you probably don't have to worry
about it just if somebody says something
I don't know just disgusting or awful or
just quite frankly something we don't
want to talk about well we'll ignore it
tip but yeah you can tip ask as many
questions as you're talking one
jeez
that's art
kill them Richardson mercy has a chance
they'll be cured you went down there in
the sewers I thought I heard a weeper in
there earlier
you're probably the bravest man I've
ever met overseer Martin has arrived
he's with Admiral Havelock now they want
to talk to you they're not zombies
they're just zombie like dad there's
zombies whatever it's fine I trust you
remember Martin and overseer before and
perhaps again someday soon I owe you
thanks for my rescue indeed
you've given us a glimmer of hope
because we've gotten what we wanted from
Campbell's journey you've done it we
know where emily kaldwin is being held
the golden cat a bath house for
aristocrats a little better than
Ackerson brothel but there's an
unfortunate twist it appears that
Pendleton's own kinsmen stand in our way
the twins Morgan and Custis not only are
they controlling Emma but they have the
controlling parliamentary votes we so
desperately need yes the Pendleton's
have to die but most importantly Emily
must be brought here safely so we can
protect her until the Lord regent and
his entourage have been dealt with her
Pendleton's waiting for you on the dock
he's asked to brief you personally I
think it's best
oh shoot all the way over there
what's her name Cecilia I forget her
name
I know the golden as the patron mind I
designed some specialized devices for
them right Kevin blueprints if anyone is
curious don't I brought you tea as a
courtesy to a colleague I won't make
that mistake in the future I'm sorry I
only thought never mind what I thought
thank you for the tea I have to get back
to that room so I miss one of the swords
behind me it's fine this isn't my main
playthrough so it's fine master Pierrot
has a great deal to learn in some areas
a royal protector just the man I needed
to speak with
Corvo I'd ask to speak to you myself
you see I'm sending you to kill my older
brothers Morgan and Kostas they're
horrible men it's true as you may have
heard cruel beyond words further my
brothers are close allies to the Lord
Regent and as long as they are in
Parliament we cannot gather the votes
we'll need to stop the Lord Regent from
further consolidating his power these
days they're best known for exploring
their favor with him to cheat others out
of their wealth let's just say that not
every family victory in quarantine for
having the plague actually has the
plague I warned my brothers in every way
I could I really did but they never did
listen to me they'll be at the Golden
Cap tonight at their usual revels
they'll be protected by the city watch
so it'll be dangerous now go please do
it before I change my mind
Pendleton the the bottle has to touch
your lips you just pretended to drink
that and I don't know why
I'll take you to the golden Kratts when
you're ready I've taken Lord Pendleton
enough times believe me
all right so Jeff the Pendleton twins
here lethal or non-lethal what are we
going with personally I think non-lethal
here's a little bit of a wet down
I'll get you as close as I can to the
golden cat Corvo
you'll have to go the rest away on your
own the entrance is near hold the square
the main thing is to make sure that
little girl Emily gets back all safe and
sure them to Pendleton's are there so
I'm guessing they'll be a lot of guards
slackjaw
might have some ideas I'm happy to get
inside the cat if you don't kill you
this here's his territory he and his
bottle Street gang holed up at the old
done walled whiskey factory they sell
the elixir that folks used to fight off
the bank I lay low but keep an eye out
for you and the little lady to bring him
back good luck to you I know Emily must
mean a lot to you be careful going up
the street corpo a river hand I know
pulled up alongside me last night and
said there's one of those watch towers
on clamoring now I guess you getting rid
of Campbell shook up the Lord Regent
okay so I gotta I gotta make like Chuck
green save my daughter
it's our bat that's a little a little
teaching moment there
huh
Emily's your daughter spoilers
it's so fucking heavily implied it's so
heavily implied
please please man
at some point it's not a spoiler it's
just common sense
we keep saying huh
died
well okay it saw me that
skur myself
Hey I fucked up when I got caught by the
tower at that point the ghost dream was
over man
the dream of ghosting was over hey
you're just a man nice lookin for slack
jaws wanting to talk to you dad him yeah
he's the one hey we got a message for
you from slackjaw he wants to talk at
the distillery
first things first here
Hey
was this
hello just saw that out of the corner of
my fucking eye no one
was it was it worth it
I don't know I'm sure most yeah no it
wasn't worth it at all
I'm missing Luke Skywalker what the fuck
are you talking about
chat
should should I be kind
got anything to smoke or eat shut up hey
boys just gonna teleport right next to
you
I don't think they're gonna last much
longer in there that's what they get for
taking free sweets from the steel that
tainted elixir is bad stuff I guess
starting to get a little blood thirsty I
never said I was going for pacifist than
you think
wait I never made that claim easy you
just need a bit ain't you heard
slack job keeps the good stuff for
himself rest of us
all right attacked me slack Joe
don't waste time than if I judge your
looks alright I might have some work for
somebody put plague in the proof tank
half my men are weepers
drop three of them in a distillery rest
don't wander an industry since it's so
and I find myself short of able bodies I
may have a point of interest for you see
way I figure it there ain't nobody worth
killing around here except those two
Pendleton's over at the golden cat I'm
right and I see it's not your nose then
voice of twins rich mean and weird worse
than most of their ink
they've been laying low there awhile not
sure why there's a lot of security at
the Golden Cap tonight though special
guests in the mic but you're gonna walk
in there dressed like that and kill the
Pendleton brothers maybe I got a better
way to take care of them too if you're
doing something for me first understand
someone I don't know who is killing my
men taking my territory stealing my
goods might be a fellow named of Galvani
I said my best man to investigate but he
went missing and well now I need someone
to find what happened to him
go to this Galvani's place he lives
nearby of clattering Boulevard you do
that for me and I'll get you a better
way into the golden cat
well we want to find a better way into
the brothel so we're gonna do what he
says rich did nothing wrong no I didn't
I killed one of the assassins who helped
killed my my just wasn't really my wife
it's kind of an illicit thing really by
the way you see these these plague
zombies I don't believe they're there if
I don't poison the still so those people
are zombies because of me
and my actions now she wasn't she wasn't
your wife because we're not royalty
we're not rat Noble we we couldn't marry
her well your your relationship with the
Empress is just scandalous it's purely
scandalous but it was love
I love this game disliked how it
punished you for playing lethally how
how does it punish you for playing
lethally you affect the world around you
and it's a beautiful thing man hey
blow-off chocolate and you can kill
quite a few people and still get the lo
que hace you can still get the best
ending and kill a surprising amount of
people I yeah I know because I've been
getting the low chaos mission rankings
and I got like eight or so murders a
level and it still says I'm low chaos
I am annoyed that in the very next
mission we play if I if I if I could put
on my critic at the side objective has
is going to the very same place that the
side objective and the last mission had
us going to so this is the second time
in a row we are going to this doctor's
office
yeah it is a bit lazy
did you see him you sound like a lot of
blood really wish I saw not a big deal
maybe you can go up later and take a
look after the mother to are gone
it's a solid game looking back yeah I
could see why they never made enough to
they made a number two of us we mean
shit
what do you think I think he's dead do
we have suspects
suspects we ain't gonna waste time
solving he'll personally if I give it a
drink what are you gonna put on your
report
I'm gonna say we found one a slack-jawed
men inside all dead and bloody and that
you are speaking
get up right now where are you someone
get over I'm getting reckless yeah I'm
getting a little bit loose a little bit
less careful I've been playing for a
while now I think I'm wearing down it's
fine
I'm still having fun what happens if I
bring the body back where should I bring
the body back with
no ghosts or clean hands I don't give a
shit about achievements I care about
having fun chief ones can go fuck
themselves I can't bring the body okay
that answers that
some achievements are fun I guess but if
it's fun to do do you really need the
achievement to do it
like clean hands like it felt okay if I
wanted to play through without killing
literally killing nobody hey that's my
third time through the game not my first
no I don't hate fun but I don't think
achievements are inherently fun
achievements just like a checklist do
this do that
hey hey hey wait a minute what just
occurred to me how come it's always me
who pay for the whiskeys
well having your weapons out slows you
down I didn't even know that I didn't
even know that I just learned something
new
check check if you enjoy Cheeseman's go
ahead and do them I'm not trying to
strip them out of existence I'm not I'm
not going to gather together the
infinity gems so I can will away the the
very existence of any and all
achievements but there's something I
personally don't give a fuck about
what's this information from my missing
guy let's have a listen
like Tom it's me crowd was right there
is someone what you do
what's a tick over the Diller over if I
made it in it's it's my game to make so
crows did my achievements would be the
most fucking obnoxious Bissell finger
you know you and me had a deal and so
that Joe never goes back ever
I have been literally been around in a
circle this 100,000 times in a row hotel
abandoned since the plague gutted this
part of town take the stairs to the top
you can use the roof to get into the
golden cat brother see that select Joe
keeps a bargain just as good as the men
who run the city talk to everybody in
the game everybody in the game in
alphabetical order each other out again
I could get rid of the Pendleton's for
you quiet like and without killing him
but you got a deuce and I would not have
a convenient list with everybody's name
my achievements would be the worse and
by virtue of being the worst also the
best
the cats having a big reopening tonight
a lot of money clients including an arts
dealer name of bunting
he's got particular taste so so I've
been told by some of the ladies got some
pretty fancy stuff locked away at his
place and the only thing preventing me
from Natick all that loot is the
combination to a safe
of course the Pendleton's have been
camped out there for months - not sure
why so that means a lot of the city
watch and other soldier types bring me
that combination my masked friend and
then I take care of the Pendleton
Brothers just like that
you ain't never even gonna touch up and
I promise I won't kill him and no one
will ever see them again now if that
ain't a deal slasher don't know what is
why do you trust this guy more than
people were working for this guy's
upfront about HIPAA dick
yes that combination he wants for the
same to keep my eyes you can rob the
safe before you give him the combination
and it doesn't hurt you at all you could
just screw him over at the same time you
know what he was straight with me I
didn't rob the safe good
hey don't you owe me a drink like
someone else
how do we get around this you just down
there now
a filthy mudlark better tramp like you
get elixir
we've been out half rations for a week
ain't catching no the cops are about to
rob this way you get lost this here's a
private party help sir please help me
thank you thank you sir
you saved me how can I thank you
I have nothing wait take this it's the
back door service key to buntings house
the art dealer on the main street I used
to work for him you know
before the plague he's let all his
servants go but he's still there
probably hoping he'll be able to sell
something from that safe of his I don't
know what he has left but it's all I
have to offer you
please take
again your your your elixir lady I can't
thank you enough strange but the stuff
that they were trying to steal all right

happened last night yes of course
all right listen fault I got to stop
with those damn miss clicks that's gonna
kill me almost did once it's fine all
right another criticism when you get
that arrow that means you're gonna be up
on the ledge you don't always go up on
the ledge and then come on man come on

Bridget Eddie said anything for a new
best of the worst
oh that's been canceled

to make supposition what powers can we
afford can we afford you just barely I'm
not that kill happy I'll be fine with
wind
tracking
Morgan's in the steam room down the
stairs tonight it's just safe in there
because I've heard rumors one of them
gets hurt I'll lose my job
oh that's just the girls talking it's
nothing
pressure builds up in the pipes and well
it almost never happens I'll make sure
they never mention it again anyhow
Morgan insisted to be in the steam room
tonight I list this my first time
through Custis is easier to manage some
nights he just waits in the gold room
and talks to a girl it's funny what
people will what alerted them
oh you saw me
they saw me that sucks
my plate there wasn't that bloody it
wasn't like I missed that because
everyone was dead I just I missed that
bit of conversation
in case you don't know where the
dormitory is I already know where is it
simply through it this part
I wonder if I've been careless enough
right now I've got like medium to high
chaos it's something else is different
to less the other time I played this
mission there was a woman here I wonder
I wonder if the ruckus scared her off or
if I didn't run her trigger something
else that causes her to come up
who are you why are you wearing that
mask
no it wasn't the one I choked down she's
the one that I encountered in the office
before there's just a mother normal old
prostitute that long time ago you're not
dead
no what you mean I have a plan I almost
got away twice there's a special door to
come and go for special people and I'll
show you and if anyone tries to stop us
you can fight them it's this way no she
walks into that room that's downstairs
somebody else was in this room because
at the time somebody else is in this
room the one that I choked out was
already choked out and my other
playthrough
don't think where'd you go
jeez Emily
you can wait him way ahead of yourself
Italy
the door is locked unlock it so we can
get away from this place leave no neck
on show and that's not fun let's go
let's get out of here
Emily I've got to go take care of some
dudes this is the door I cut out once
then they caught me and mocked it oh do
I need the key yet nope I got the key
we're a minority right after this I'm
smack dab in the middle of that's where
I'm at my normal playthrough
rich what is this fun you speak of
oh I'm sorry let me go put on Final
Fantasy and hit the a button repeatedly
talk to that nice girl again when I told
you about
you realize you're at the golden camp
right yeah but she's different she
really liked idiot
she likes your money not you you're just
jealous
shut up
I don't have to like FF but admit I'm
wrong wrong about what the tedious
combat the shit characters fuck Final
Fantasy
the Pendleton's are here you're supposed
to be on duty there's supposed to be on
guard
you'll get dismissed for sure I can't
believe this you said you weren't even
drunk wake up finally I've been like
this for 20 minutes your footsteps sound
a little loud and you gained a little
weight on it I just like last time
understand slowly and only trigger the
shock at my command get it and the safe
word tonight will be retribution let's
say you hear that you stopped one sharp
out of line and you are out of a job
stay focused please
oh I deserved that one
shall I tell you why the pendulums are
heater right stop with them I cheated
them rob them of thousands
you're ruthless
don't hold back I'll tell you everything
the Pendleton's inheritance was worth
hundreds of thousands at least told me
it was junk retribution retribution that
was perfect for tonight all my service I
said the tribution now let me out
bitch who is this what do you want the
safe yes of course the combinations 879
take anything you find I think I felt my
heart skip
please my heart will take this ask me
anything
I screwed the Pendleton's yes and and
I've been to the brimsley see they
worship the outside I've seen it I did
it too
Wow one too many times
alright it's fine how are you still
moving
shet who who the fuck's told you this is
gonna be a no-kill playthrough who said
that I demand to know do we know where
the Pendleton's are gold room steam room
all right or the clues that we have
Morgan will be in there all night more
coin for us that we'd make even more if
they didn't blow it on prostitutes my
cousin's a foreman at their mind
he says the slaves have dug half a mile
down so deep they're dying by the Dozen
from collapse or fumes but the silver is
almost gone what are they going to do
looks like they're gonna gamble and
drink every night until it's gone and
jump in the river right they state that
the conservative position gets an extra
three votes
things are bad could the city get any
worse chances are very good
done
gone
pressure valve a stopped working poppet
properly this is the second time you
will not get a third chance do you
understand repair it promptly reroute
valve you say hmm is steam valve hmm
that's our target
anything kills more fun with these guys
I'm gonna be honest with you
can i rewire it
Oh lock the door
something I can do I don't know that I
can
actually already lock can I block it
as far as I know I can't so I'm just
gonna I'm gonna proceed with the plan
took the prostitute out with him that's
that's cold man that's cold sorry lady
I'm gonna take your money though
ya know an innocent woman like I'm not
proud of that one but it's neat to see
what happens
there's been word of a ruffian
I hear you didn't say
who do you want me to be tonight the
Pendleton anyone high overseer hey
excited me to retreat
well we made it away I don't feel very
good about this this is turning into a
glorious train wreck yeah it's fine
these guards they're really dumb and
it's fine
oh damn it damn it damn it
so long for so you having to come that's
kind of fun man
so much for dumb guards ain't you can't
win them all
which way to the egress
I hesitated I thought wait they're
walking away I don't need to kill them
but then I forgot I am holding a cook
grenade in my hands that might be the
dumbest thing I have ever done but there
was some thought behind it it was just
dumb thought
we network
yes I have been disarmed my stealth has
been Dishonored
I've dishonored the very concept of
stealth tonight by the way with that
grenade if I had the cam on you still
wouldn't be able to see me because it's
too dark in here
there would have been a very nice
facepalm but don't dally that young
let's head to our daughter just get the
fuck out of here
like I'm going the wrong way
say no emily's have the boat but I went
the wrong way to get to the vote because
this is a this mission is a comedy of
errors only it's missing the comedy so
it's it's just errors
look out for the watch they got no
respect for laws
this matter I'm having fun
she get more review views and Isola
strays are bad I really need jack i met
your friend Samuel he's going to show me
how to steer this boat Samuel and I were
worried about you Corvo ready when you
are
are you both ready to go Corvo you must
have worked wonders out there in the
city tonight I can't believe my old eyes
alright there we go we got you know what
all that matters
we got Emily back safe okay and by the
way people are talking about you getting
punished for killing a lot of people
it's fucked up as that was look at it
says for my overall chaos ax
alright it's still low so there is still
room for playing this game in murdering
people and still getting the quote best
ending found dick all for money that run
though
so you did the business did you core
vote I'm not one to speak against my
betters minded but if anybody ever
deserved their fate
it was those Pendleton's what business
are you talking about oh I got grown-up
business girl I mean your ladyship
forgive me it's okay I heard a lot of
grown-up business at the golden tab oh I
should concentrate on piloting misspoke
Karen yes but I know I'm playing this
I think this honor does a solo game
young lady Emily I'm Calista I'll be
caring for you and schooling you while
you're with us pleased to meet you as am
I would you like to see your room in the
tower can I see it yes you may you will
get to see it all the entirety of The
Hound pits good I think I'll like it
here I'll go with Calista Corvo I'll see
you later
you do not fail to impress armed with a
blade you've changed the course of the
city forever
and with the Pendleton twins gone our
own Lord Pendleton will assume their
votes in Parliament in one night you've
done more than most men do in a lifetime
I need to speak to you soon but for now
Lord Pendleton requests your attention
she doesn't even call him dad I don't
think she knows this is an illicit
affair between a common bodyguard a
commoner and the the high Empress of the
land
wait she's his daughter well here so far
it's only been hinted I don't know if
they explicitly state that later in the
game I'm pretty sure it said flat out
and dishonored - alright I think I think
that's good for the night nothing that's
good a really shitty stealth run but god
I I love it i I absolutely fucking adore
it
absolutely adore it alright um I caught
up on tips looks like I got a couple
here naanum says got back in the gaming
after seven years because you
recommended doom thanks please catch me
up on what consoles I missed what the
hell are the switch and Wii U and the PS
Vita were is v and is the PS Vita worth
getting doom these are mostly Jack
questions but I am at heart a a PC gamer
so I can't I can't tell you what's good
about an Xbox one or a Playstation 4
well I can tell you what's good about a
Playstation 4 blood-borne it's the only
the only reason that you need to own a
Playstation 4 is blood-borne which is
fantastic but otherwise I'm pretty much
PC guy shadow Elite 5 says now that no
