it's alright it's alright
quicks way
one book Carl getting around in this
game is kind of irritating that's right
you're still looking get in the car get
in the car Anna Anna Anna bulb Anna you
guys miss jack yet he's gonna say shit
like antipope man huh
and a working taxi no it is not
oh that's a sedan though that's better
sedans are better than faster
we're Jack Oh Jack couldn't take it
anymore the excitement Jack went home
and I'm gonna stay here I'm gonna finish
this game up hopefully make it quick and
then I'm gonna put I'm gonna put Dead
Rising behind me for a bit after this I
think I've had my fill
I hate this open world getting places in
this game is more of a hassle than it is
fun
I don't think Dead Rising works with
larger Maps I think I think this is a
mistake why does it blow up for no
reason
shit will blow up in this game I have no
idea why
it's like how many times have I gone
back and forth through this is then
again you go back in front all the time
Dead Rising wanted to just I don't know
better mAb getting around here as a
hassle not a joy the driving sucks
take his coffee all right nice
my Elvis man not really the driving
sucks and you're constantly driving yes
I have to to get around this map is too
big to be running everywhere you
technically the mode I'm playing there
is a meaningful timer actually the mode
I'm playing playing a nightmare mode and
a timer works differently than it didn't
Dead Rising 1 & 2 I don't like it as
much but I don't know it's adding some
kind of tension to this game which is
comically easy
yeah I'm not gonna go all the way over
here all the way over there everything's
always on the other side of the fucking
earth I just I just came from that
fucking area now we're going back
I'd stick to one car and go there but
there's constant fucking Road box
roadblocks
don't break because I don't what I need
to find
I want to take this wrong because I'm an
idiot yeah because I'm an idiot all
right
so I also accidentally say I'm taking
the long way to my next destination all
right
but so much prescription to that taxi
I'm not exactly sure what caused it to
blow up so quick
the really long way there
we're getting another car annum follow
me follow me into this automobile get in
the car and you won't need help
get off my car yes Jacqueline
jack has jakka's children and a wife and
responsibilities
she'll be fine
presumably she'll be fine Hey
I want another gun with me so don't fall
too far behind now
oh yeah
ah see what his armies
[Applause]
where is girl
it's hectically those getaway Carter but
it's not a blow-off
who was phone and I'm skipping most of
the side missions the phone keeps giving
these side missions which you can skip
no this isn't a particularly effective
lockdown at all I would call it a
miserable failure
the rooms cleared right now
really
that's mine
thank you for your verification
yeah
whose parts
all right lady friend have a drink
Oh backup
broken-down car right oven no car
oh alright all fuck
now I need to find a fucking car
I can't even leave with this car because
the roadblock where there's somebody
fuckin roadblocks this game it's it's
frustrating it's not fun
oh wait and get pests so never mind oh
fuck it up like that
I can't I can't do it
all right
for let rich strong hey I heard any
complaints but it's Friday the 13th
[Music]
oh wait I'm going to the wrong spot Oh
No Oh No why do I have to go there ah
shit
shit
that's dumb I'm dumb
[Music]
my mark level 50 this car would have
blown up so many times
so many hundreds of times
Oscar win
and if you're watching this night I
won't be too much longer I'm nearing the
end of this game I just wanted to finish
it up I don't know there's gonna be
enough left of this game for a full
second stream so I'm just yeah just get
to the end we'll do it and then I'll be
done I'll be done with this game
yeah I'm just a blueprint hell that's
time that's interesting this is for Hail
Mary
oh that was sucking grab the thing with
you
all right sidekick
keep driving this this absolutely
fucking wrecked car but it's fast
I like this car
now that I'm leveled up some cars don't
blow up so easy when you've run them bad
and like this car
it's bumblebee he's seen better days
can't believe your car could be an
explosion your character just doesn't
react at all yeah this guy's seen a lot
he probably expects to die that's fine
we screamed that ever every explosion
he'd never shut up really in there why
is the airplane pink probably because
she painted it
a changer
closed single-family yeah
come on let's get any and the others one
two three let's get bonuses an honor of
get belief fest 2018 how many studio I
think Jeff read the Studio Ghibli films
have you seen you have a favorite one
any thoughts of Miyazaki lamenting the
fact that animation studios are almost
all 3d over 2d I think I've seen zero
Karin might be mad at me
Karin legs was a Totoro iknowjax Fanny
but me I can't say much
Karin I won't be too much longer I
really won't I just I just wanted to
finish this up I'm nearing the last
chapter of the game oh this is weird
weird things are about to happen but
they've been happening on game
Oh Karen turn Eversole still reading the
chat house how's the new fishie doing we
bought a new fishie today
it's a little love scarlet baddest tiny
little fish durable though
[Music]
punching things you can't see it's
pretty because those things are just
tiny scarlet badasses they eat really
tiny things they're little little
predators but they like like planarian
worms and little whatever whatever tiny
little thing they can get their mouth
and make any sense but I will take it
okay I think this is the second time the
plot has taken away all of our item
items they like they like doing that yes
they non-perfect know death row starting
at a high level I don't I don't I don't
have enough care about this game to try
for a literally perfect runner I don't
feel like streaming for 12 hours or how
fucking long that would take so we're
just powering through the story quickly
no it's not the worst thing ever made
this game but it's a bad Dead Rising
game I don't know if that makes sense to
you this game isn't terrible it's a it's
on the high side of mediocre it's better
love it better than mediocre but it's
terrible Dead Rising game
they say I told I told the story before
of the the shrimp weep on and few days
week after we bought it that's long
madam in just a few days after we bought
it I I see this little shrimp corpse in
the fish tank and I take this little
dead fish and I bring it back at the
fish store my ass fish die we just got
it and they gave me a refund on the
shrimp only to come home and discovered
that the shrimp was fine it just molten
[Music]
by that food
I was set up to do extra damage but I
can only presume using the electric
weapon on the robot might help me
oops shit
[Music]
that was actually closer there and then
it should have been goddamnit
ah
fortunately this game is insanely easy
we might die
well rights I should have died I really
should have like it's bullshit that I
didn't die just there it's bullshit I
feel bad that I didn't die
[Music]
I hadn't tried yours as the personal
investment was that's a hysterical joke
that nobody is going to get
problem is I'm trying to power through
this game I'm not taking my time in here
I'm just kind of but mashing and trying
to get this over with and it's killing
me
technically it hasn't been killing me
yes I feel bad that's so I show so
should be dead and any kind of game that
wasn't ridiculously easy I'd be dead
right there and I'd have deserved it
but this is Dead Rising 3 so I'm still
alive and we're still going
who was that guy general evil he wants
to he wants to weaponize zombies as if
they couldn't already fucking do that
but he wants the special zombies that
have bees on their heads
[Music]
all right I'm good good I walk in
selection
the jack leave yes Jack left
did rich leave almost
I should go this way
yeah this looks promising
I got here
two big guns made an assault rifle when
a shotgun taped together top five games
all-time that's hard to do
XCOM the next com2 yeah you know you
dooms quite fond of Dead Rising you guys
you guys know what I like by this point
fun a thief and played beaten ages
boxing-glove I just I just want to make
flaming boxing gloves for fun for fun I
want flaming boxing gloves and you're
not helping me all fucking
for the weapons break in this game yes
I'm at level 50 things maxed out so I've
I've got some durable weapons
yep
[Applause]
thought this looped around I don't think
it does
well I think of speedrunning that's a
fine hobby
I think got nothing against speedrunning
some of them are queen some of them
could be quite entertaining to watch
you're getting killed while you're
standing there looking at that why're
you fucking gawking animation
my dad there would not have been my
fault
but I'm not safe scum that would be
dishonorable
mistakes
you're fixing the door
we won't fill this mess fuck you all
fuck you all very much
[Music]
like a fucking gazelle
Oh Gary what are you doing here
[Music]
get her out of your Gary they're gonna
bomb the city people's lives are at
stake
ethnicity Latino it's from Santa cabeza
you might know what that is Santa
that's the other big hint about his
tattoo
[Music]
[Music]
all right so more traversing
lady in song
by the way
I'm gonna complement something in this
game it's a really nice touch this
bridge every time you go across this
bridge there's a guy on top of that bus
shooting it zombies and he's in control
he says hey come over here buddy and
he's got free supplies for you he's
there the whole game except near the end
he's mysterious he's just he's gone and
they make note of the fact that he's
gone and you never find out what fucking
happen to this guy at least not in the
main game I know there's another's DLC
he might be he might be a DLC
protagonist for all I know but that's
neat
and a problem
comical amount of zombies
I can't even I can't even see where the
fuck I'm going
it's why they had make the game gray and
dull now I think it didn't need to be
grain gone dull I think they just made a
grand ol they don't have much time but
if I could find another gun I could make
a weapon to use patience
and you know I don't much care for the
rig
Oh
yeah I'll take it
should've been a fucking headshot
start around
fuck
listen we're getting near the end of
this three hours I said that one hour
ago one hour ago I said about two more
hours Rhonda
end of game love interest well we're
bringing her back to her ex-husband so
it's not likely
who's Gary the fat guy the fat mobster
guide now the love interest is the girl
you barely interact with in the game at
all that's the love interest and you
know what you're just gonna have to
fucking deal with it kid
demand to have my I guess the game
despawn did so the military could fit in
here that's that's a shame that's a
shame
and what else we got the drive-in
I'm on the fence if I'm gonna skip that
last boss fight or not well not last but
the last non-major storyline boss fight
I guess we could bring Ronda do it
alright do it
which way my honor actually behind me
wait I'm all turned around oh yeah
that's right that's why
shit
you want to see a robot arm in action
okay you can see our robot arm in action
in the boss fight I'm had to do fuck it
we'll do it
and I got it
[Music]
get in here
[Music]
what Olivia blown up why
[Music]
you just killing this game for me yeah
the commute is this game is Achilles
heel we're all the shops with silly
clothes I don't know where is anything I
don't know this whole map is just random
shit that's the same response yes this
is an offensive stereotype
[Music]
boxing gloves
[Music]
[Music]
the chink in the final blowing that's
great
[Music]
voices came sticks to the tradition of
having savable bosses I said we saved
him and forgot to save the girl
I don't think a stitch
you take a flaming sword you gonna carry
that
we got lots of fire in our group lots of
fire
and took a baseball bat
all right let's go
where are we
come this way everyone to the building
that's over here alright that boss fight
that probably slowed down the end of
that stream I was I I guarantee you I
was on the track beating the game when I
said I would I was where through that
timeline out the window
what are you ready
and I got ya decent weaponry weird we're
doing decent alright now I need a car
and we need to head north
Rhonda can you fit on here at all
no I'll take that better than nothing
nice tank blew up
you make
I'd rather just drive the sedan I'm not
gonna have this car too long anyway this
is a roadblock coming up
[Music]
and that's survivors get bags I just
don't care I got things to do
I get it people and drag or funny that
but that survivor on the stage I've
drove past there there in drag and
that's funny
I'm just going fuck I know but I need to
find out the car pretty close
one of those guys
your love interest hopes have been
dashed - I put her up I put a bunch of
zombies around her just be careful in
there cue
what's this hand jazz hands
I missed this one
all right do stuff or something oh she's
gonna say they where's read supposed to
meet me here but he hasn't shown up you
think that loser outside chase them off
well it's almost there any problems to
meet us at the plane so maybe he's there
let's go Nick
Annie uh red and I we used to be
together a long time ago
we're not now oh this is the love
interest I forgot all about her yeah I
know
exactly exactly
I'm just I miss it did you say Annie are
you okay that blast suit let's be
getting sweaty by now yeah you know what
your fucking zombies this is what you
want to wear a man
what is jazz-hands day
oh that's funky where do we need to go
Oh God all the way down there yeah
or Annie keep up
next Bank of us over something that's a
terrible woman
and while I got it
yeah fuck that get the car that's better
better ride and it you see me getting a
car and fighting zombies Annie Annie are
you okay Annie Annie are you okay Annie
are you okay Annie
I gotta turn around
nobody did not get her gun Andy did you
get your gun
smooth I guess it worked so be ready
when I get back you are Isabella keys
I've heard rumors about no Sora Stan
what is it you have to tell me no more
she's still better
they did with young men do they spread
their seeds on this
screaming here at all
why would Carlito make one of the time
bomb orphans he gave out his his zombie
control immunity thing you know what
you'd want it you want to keep the Cure
close by another plot thing that makes
no sense how far are we from the end of
the game one more chapter two more boss
fights
mimic that is a nice tattoo number 12
what are you doing oh do you know what
it means five million dollars for a you
sure gave up on your family fast come on
Nick
I told you I'm really living like a
pariah
I got four kids to feed nice nice
reference I get it already
was that the beneficiary of a glitch
alright I'll take it
I'm so difficult lungi
ow too much
nope that didn't work either ocean
yeah
now that particular right that's a lot
tougher on nightmare huzzas games
comeback compared to the masterpiece
TMNT out of the shadows worse much worse
sorry I actually liked TMNT out of the
shadows
Nick Annie are you okay yeah it's
hemlocks voice- sir we have them
cornered
requesting additional time to mop things
up
and they're in love I guess
honey love interest is the five-year old
girl from Dead Rising 2 this doesn't add
anything to the story other than I know
that character she's not a real Annie oh
they excuse it her middle name is Annie
this is a little Katie
you don't know what that's like who the
hell is this Nick Ramos who are you
what happened to Stacy they actually
mention her Isabella Keys here this is
the this is the smoking hot one from
Dead Rising 1 she's the girl you escaped
with at the end the one whose brother
was the terrorist you soon with the
distance Frank West is taking pictures
may be a shame he's not here if they
really wanted the fan service it would
have been Frank West showing up
find a way I can't leave you guys you're
the important
Frank what's this too busy beating up
the Hulk yes I know reference
come on
you're pretty sure he's in the game I've
seen hide or hair I have not seen any
sign of Frank was not hide nor hair of
you know he's gone
isn't there a memorial for always you
see throughout Frank West display in a
museum that talks about the history of
zombies but it's not really Frank West
in the game that's not the real ending
by the way this is this is all fake I'm
skipping the credits because they just
loop anyway
so what we have here in Dead Rising 3 is
a generic story with decent side
characters and stereotypical villains
yeah why do all the games do this
tradition it was actually a surprise
than the first one for broke tradition
for they sold you the extra endings the
real ending you had to pay for it
separately fuck dead rising before
Annie's right sure won't mean a thing if
we don't stop this sure what my daughter
season you want to impress me
here's your chance
this is it irritating at all
but he'd not be dumb and we need to find
food
food has now become priority and I went
the wrong way I'm a dumbass yeah well
it's not gonna hurt us
and she's gonna be irritating
fruit up there are you there I think no
there's not what
[Music]
and yeah that's that's what was a Frank
West statuette he's referenced in the
game but he's not in the game
no timer in this game once you get to
the overtime mode it pauses until you
actually start the end encounter so
technically right now I've got infinite
time if I wanted to do a full
playthrough on nightmare I could use
this time right now to get all the
collectables shed but I have I have no
interest in doing that
otice The Forgotten men oh I don't know
if you've seen it you you see Otis's
funeral in this one you go to a funeral
home and as a coffin and portrait next
to the coffin and it's Otis's portrait
which for some reason they took a
picture of him wearing his work jacket
but hey whatever
Otis was a character can bed rising
women utterly confused by just talking
about
oh by the way playing this game I'm at
level 50 but I never fully leveled up my
my life bar so I don't have any of the
regenerating health crap and I don't
have the infinite items spawning Locker
that goes anywhere with you either
shit's just broken man
I met a girl during a zombie outbreak
myself way back then
listen
so so Chuck just fuck things up with
Stacy Forsyth from Dead Rising 2 that's
nice that's nice
fuck you shark you don't get a happy
ending
this is better off than Frank was at the
ending of Dead Rising for oh not if you
pay for the real ending fuck Dead Rising
for
maryanne don't you understand
will create outbreaks anywhere we want
to we can control where it goes and when
we're done kill the Kings oh yeah Dead
Rising four you have to pay for the real
ending
it would have been good to you Marion
it's not like any other man would have
shock
my car disappeared ah lovely limits why
do my car disappear we're gonna find a
new car come on Chuck rain
check it in the car we got shit to do
Chuck Chuck Chuck
my aim has left me all right let's have
way too much time getting that car
we're gonna
yeah but I totally wanted to grab that
not get in the car
fuck that up then again I I didn't
why are they that's weird that's just
weird
yep
I was getting the headshots left right
earlier all right motherfuckers you
motherfuckers
alright go on that way best way there is
actually probably
yes now we're flipping this car
these zombies drop guns you probably use
some more guns
[Music]
is that a constant yeah that's a side
mission I've ignored
and voice favorite bridge
how the hell did you find Isabella Keys
last time I saw her that director who
was shot carried out there
right
yeah that works that totally works for
me
oh come on
are you squished
okay gun hands are awesome fucking
awesome and I now love gun hands
you get into bed alright goodnight I
swear I'm almost done
you know the driving in this game blows
or it's just highways husband jerk jerk
stop wasting bullets wrong button
wait for me where's that did I oh wait
I overshot my mark
good question

is the cure to to this zombie stuff and
he's putting himself in foolish mortal
danger
am I done I'll be done sure you can just
leave y'all just stick around fine man
yep
somebody get aboard I'm just is there
brawling
do you want to guess how he's gonna die
take a take a guess how he's going to
die
I am
here's something I do know there is no
cure for this
I was worried that guy I can't you know
you just met this fucker
my first look so satisfied yeah I really
don't I mean
this isn't much of a challenge
the game in general is pretty pretty
easy
[Music]
Katie you gonna do better Kenny Katie
wants that cure Katie wants that zombie
cures what Katie wants she knows what's
what she she knows what's what
all right Ridge tending s little half
the side missions there we go one that
much longer than I thought with me
mega buster yeah I know you can get the
Mega Buster in this oh well there's
here's the after credits thing
annoying car backtracking the game
finished like a half an hour I said I'd
be out of my way
optional boss
are you doing this is it for the money I
don't give a shit
I'm going to make up for what my brother
did and restore the good name of our
family be a hero for once and for all
time
be fun if you didn't bitch about the
game I said kind things about this game
deal with it I said it's slightly better
than mediocre it's not that bad deal
with it if it's your favorite thing ever
when we just agreed disagreed man
it's not terrible it's better my initial
view yeah brother this game what playing
at this game grew on me a little bit
ain't got nothing on Dead Rising 1 or 2
you need to you need to fix the map huge
open world it turns out maybe not such a
great idea 1 you you you got tedious car
slog and road blocks just say you liked
it virtual I said it slightly better
than mediocre that's saying I liked it
Dead Rising for next I know I said I
wouldn't do this one and I still
technically didn't do a starting from
level one perfect run but dead rising
for almost certainly not that's almost
certainly Anna you're not going to
believe me and that's my fault but
almost certainly not my by a spot that
has a safehouse on Martha we're gonna
we're gonna we're gonna take a look and
see if we can do this find this Mega
Buster thing
not dead rising for what's next in my
agenda
I was thinking I may be revisiting some
old PlayStation 2 stuff there's some
shorter games on the PlayStation 2 I get
no death run all right skip you I needed
to get to a la huaca I've loaded up
chapter 6 in game and we're gonna find
herself a locker room and we're gonna
see how this mega buster is fortunately
means I have no items and I need to
clear out a safe house it shouldn't be
that all the way up there I'm fine just
do it
no weapon I can make the lead pipe
give me a lead pipe all that was
terrible
yes I got right now
really
all right safe house is clear it means I
get to the locker where would it be
firearms properly unless they put it in
combo weapons for no good reason
I'm gonna check not think so
guns weren't guns
honestly if we're gonna do that you go
whole hog right
it doesn't charge I'll just bounce so
that's neat
and I can't charge the shot
what about the game over screen looks
like
whoa okay spoon something new today
yeah the gun fingers were better that
was yeah that was just fanservice yes I
never died no not during the game not
there in the main game I did fucking
around at the end and I kind of let it
happen
it's a fuck you game well this game
takes so long to just end the fucking
game humble bragging I'm gonna hunt the
bread it's not really humble bragging
