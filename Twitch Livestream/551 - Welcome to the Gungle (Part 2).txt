shit
you must be fanboy
you must be not prepared for adult
situations like neck-snapping
that's true orange strike hats as rich
we could never think of you as a Marvel
fan boy we know you hate everything a
navy gun some assembly required I just
have a gun I can kill anything and I
sharing a chat oh maybe you could find
like Peter parts yes interesting
interesting
Civil War has the same director as car
fuckers I don't know what that is
isn't it the same people though that did
that did a Winter Soldier I'm gonna tell
you are you oh yeah you're definitely
gonna die I'm gonna die
Wow look at that thing you know this
thing does and I don't like it I don't
like it at all
mo conde been trying to coop uh yeah
yeah why don't you uh Olin I'm gonna
look up Civil War was directing it yeah
Anthony Russo Anthony and Joe Russo they
did a Winter Soldier they also did you
me and Dupree you know that movie with
Owen Wilson in a dog they directed some
episodes of community carpoolers
oh and car fuckers yes they did director
short called car fuckers big picture
mode Oh God
big picture mode so if you like Winter
Soldier you will probably like Civil War
and I think most people like to Winter
Soldier I know you you didn't much care
for the first cap in America I haven't
seen wonder soldier yeah I know I should
I know I should Bob such a Marvel fan
boy the night that I don't go and see
some of the major Marvel movies I was
that's why I was so surprised knowing
how big of a fan yeah yeah yeah even
people who didn't like like it Mike and
Jay I didn't I know they didn't like the
ending of First Avenger I didn't like
like the second half 2/3 of the movie
yeah and and I think Mike and Jay like
the Winter Soldier a lot once once you
get past like the orogeny stuff and he
rescues the
then it turns into we have to fill in
Captain America's backstory before he
gets sent forward in time it just does a
bunch of shit this kind of comically
convoluted montage of action sequences
and what's the problem I don't see the
problem
and then he punches the red skull in the
faces they have to fight yep and then
and then he made a really idiotic
decision with a poor setup it ends
terrible yeah you know I I really wish
they would have set up the the death
better or you know the crash death
better in First Avenger but you know I
liked it overall what should we do here
what is this what yeah use configs for
our like why not okay
oh you know what I really want to
re-watch ant-man it's not available for
rent anywhere what the hell is this
that's it I think that's it yeah that's
it I really want to rewatch a man I've
only seen it once in the theaters but
it's not available to rent it's only
available to buy digitally and I just
don't I don't like I didn't like it
enough in the theaters to buy it but we
seem to be working here yeah
everything's streaming and you know you
just you just switch that back to you
I'll take good try see if you can do
this well you take that I'll take this
one
do we have to do something funky and
steamed to get it to recognize two
controllers oh if I have to do something
in here right controls player 1 player 2
oh wait wait wait
keyboard mouse we go up this this is
okay click go down X input controller
player 2 is over over one more there try
that okay
confirm
yeah
can you I'm still controlling your back
guy I need to I need to take a bathroom
break why are you the chat did you
figure this out okay hold on we're gonna
figure this out hold on yeah we're going
through the controller shit again the
controller is working but we can't seem
to
we can't seem to get co-op to working
hold on hold on we are working on it
that's not gonna help
okay
we're still controlling the same person
that needs to change
talk to the purple guy
we're still okay we're still we're still
talking to the same people oh I fell off
the thing
yeah now now we're having the same
problem where they're moving even though
I'm using the same controller second
player can only play as The Wizard guy
oh okay okay I get it all right hold on
goddamnit time to stand up it's time to
stand up stand it up time everybody
everybody stand up while we figure out
control or nonsense
hi okay stand up for the stream we
figured it out okay and so you just
start going and I just joined okay do
you want to gold you want to be the
Sinclairs you carry right yeah I'll be a
sec where I'm gonna get into this up
your alley
I need some kind of three sided coin I
can flip for this star do or hyper light
drifter okay I'm ready so in order to
start co-op you need to talk to the
purple lady and then when the purple
lady turns around you are in co-op mode
okay
is what's happening if you are in a way
it was so obvious right what do you do
if you are in a wheelchair well then you
know still if you see if you can stand
up do it and if you can't stand up then
don't don't be a dick well wait nope I'm
still controlling you yep take this yeah
but the same color just put it down just
put it just put it the fuck down maybe
we just need to change it hello no you
don't need to change it change the
keyboard
it's - okay well I'm turning off this
the steam controller how do I turn off
the steam controller or just fuck it
just great
he's just shit just a piece of shit all
right okay nope
but did you change the key word for
player - hold on whoa hey save it
oh right sorry okay okay
oh wait hold on wait wait you had to go
to country you had to go to keyboard
mouse yeah they go to keyboard mouse
rich I still need the mouse to aim I
think no you use you I I'm the lady well
so you use I'll use this time are you
okay yeah yeah I'll figure it out
alright alright I'll figure it out
eat look at her Lou her eyes get big
when she jumps we good
give me a give me a pill okay we got it
so in order to use the steam controller
the second player needs to be on a mouse
and keyboard now you know that makes
perfect sense I like her dog I don't
like a crossbow you don't like the
crossbow usually crossbows pretty BA I
thought she had a crossbow yeah I
haven't used her yet I saw streams where
people were using her and she had her
there there it is I tried oh we have to
agree oh oh
what does the dog do no no look if it
picks up things for you here we are
mother fucka
decidedly hard name coming you all right
all right we got this okay he'll
actually don't go through yet what
Oh so a configuration all right we want
to change this guy not to Mouse but to
enjoy stick joystick yes a camera
probably camera if you do move it's
gonna want to move you carefully yes
this is just style of input I'm pretty
yeah yeah yeah
nope
treasure and directions yeah nothing
okay
okay because it's said to use that as a
mouse and keyboard relative mouse serial
joystick move output relative mouse okay
pretty low on that sensitivity
Jebus okay
advanced settings it's been so long
since I've been here I know I'm saving
her sensitivity
let's just go way up on that my
sensitivity and
and stick response curve how that means
adaptive center adaptive centering yes
we want that because I believe that
always places it oh wait treats the
first touch position on the trackpad is
a new center of the door signal Drive I
think that's oh that's fucking stupid
this fucking steam control you guys well
oh shit
for that what you want I kind of I
wanted to make it more sensitive Jesus
I think this is what we want just needs
to be more sensitive I was willing to do
this with a mouse and keyboard we'd be
like we'd be I'm like level three of the
game by now okay are you ready let's go
okay I got this
can you shoot me huh maybe all right
okay
you got a dude down here we can't afford
it right now what do you got what do you
got lined up gunner though I end up gun
blunderbuss grab us you can't buy
anything can you probably not all right
I think that's why I'm this person I'm
just a helper like I don't even know if
I can upgrade my gun or anything
that mean
Russia whose America now I have the ug
custom control
he got
oh and i think i think if i pick up
anything it just goes to you whoo bird
hey over here over here gun over here
gun
I haven't mastered the the steam
controller yet you think it'd be much
easier oh wait one more thing before we
go into the next room
you haven't said weird huh I think you
have it set weird what what do you think
mouse but not Mouse I know what do you
think I should do I don't know what does
Chad those champing jackson do okay well

- yep and it's similarly weird did you
want to just play then or yeah well just
play well just play and talk just put
via the old plan talk you give it a go
I'm gonna take a little break Oh wake up
wake up comp you traitor like the
Marines got badass armor it's pretty
cool cool I like a helmet and um it
reminds me a lot of Halo 4 oh you could
probably spend the money you could burn
spent the money on fucked up oMG I just
googled purple space bazooka and now I
know it's official name well they go
what'd you buy
RPG what's that rocket-propelled grenade
I assume oh so you've you've now bought
something that can randomly yes in the
gungeon
okay I'm with you I'm with you okay
let's get Oh what's happening I'm
accidentally hitting the oh thanks for I
got messed up okay cool commit changes
yes great steam controls kill it did
they really do I just
I'm just not a fan of that steam
controller you know I mean rich knows
yeah do you guys know you do a
role-playing grenade it's a grenade that
thinks it's a machine gun it's pretty
awesome
I want this probably gonna be some kind
of ton though word is something there's
nothing about it will be like a thing
sure I can all shoot dice or something
oh shit a 20-sided die that would be
great actually I like that what game is
this this is enter the gungeon not
dungeon Gunjan its top-down twin-stick
shooter very much like Binding of Isaac
where procedurally generated levels and
randomized items also got a little bit
of nuclear thrown in it with the roll
dodge mechanic and ammo management that
sort of stuff so it's actually a nice
mixture of Isaac and nuclear throne
so if you are fans of either of those
games or was that other game that I was
playing that was very similar to this I
forget it fuck it enter the binding of
the necrodancer kind of its nuclear
binding necro nuclear binding dancer and
then figure out the fireplace anyone in
the chat who knows
shadow alley 5 why does everyone hate
jars irving's he was such a funny
character with his clumsiness funny
cartoony voice such well-developed
character he's also a misunderstood
Gungan that needs some loved that needs
some love too rich sure why not
a new Suicide Squad Squad trailer just
came out do you think it's gonna be
funnier than the other trailer do you
think they're gonna highlight the
light-hearted nature of the movie now
they still they really believe it's just
that it's not light and not the fact
that Superman is not heroic I yes by the
way is the movies too dour
that's literally what they think like
nobody's complained about Batman and
Batman is not light but the Marvel
movies have a comedic light tone to
enrich when one of your two heroes is a
fucking monster you got a problem I
think fearful sludge boy says some of
the guns are like water pistols or you
can find a water barrel that you can use
in the fireplace okay and you put the
fire out and then something happens
somebody happens I lose my arm oh my
badass helmet it's going yeah I was
getting more you can always get more
armor yeah what's with that there's the
it seems like you're earning a lot more
money than usual I'm not complaining
no just strange specif so awesome oh
that's uh that's probably dog see fleshy
patches that's the important question is
in Suicide Squad is any of their mothers
named Martha that's the important
question there's now a company-wide
mandate that nobody's mother could be
named Martha appear they didn't like
that they very good people really didn't
like the whole Martha thing so well if
we're still gonna have their mothers
have the same name but it's not gonna be
Martha what wrong messages can be seen
to take away from the feedback right
right why did you say her name I mean I
know Martha is a pretty common name
rocket-powered bullets not is that just
all your bullets or did you get a new
gun oh that's a passive oh oh shit Doug
I think it's about to get real or or
this item is really gonna suck okay no

have no idea
open it up fucking open it up we have a
consensus you want to consensus yeah
what do you guys think open it I see an
open I see yeah that's why we pick
somebody one random person in the chat
oh we can use our new person randomizer
leftover beefcake who's done wonderful
things for us yes
that's giving me out a big pic like how
do I do it yeah you gotta turn the steam
controller on and do buttons that's good
I'm good with it
beefcake has made has made for us a
randomizer a random affectation
application where we can choose random
people and it's is announced we're in
Schad yeah let's try that okay ready we
are gonna pick a random person we pick
is gonna tell us well then how we open
this chest okay ready
fearful sledge boy do we open that chest
or not fearful slugs boy tell us you
have been chosen fearful sludge boy tell
us leftover beef cake you need to sell
this shed to streamers this is this is
some great shit

boy purple he's purple Oh
what fish he hasn't seen yet so sure of
what such boy says rotten tell us
whether or not rich opens a chest

the fuck not it says fearful sludge bone
all right great get me back in the game
okay hold on hold on hold on just pick
another random person that will do
nothing and they can feel bad the only
problem fearful sludge boy and it's not
a real what's growing flip multiplier
wats ancient technique creases gonna
output whatever a table is flipped
that's fine
the only problem is it does not your
twat sure does not work on Windows 10
which is not a big deal because that you
know but like the laptops Windows 10 we
have it running on on the main computer
but it is not Windows 10 optimized for
some reason I need a table and I can't
find one you flip them all rich No
oh whoa that's pretty awesome sweet that
is pretty awesome
yeah and you're right mr. glitch is more
accurate to say Windows 10 does not work
with the Twatter because yeah Windows 10
is the garbage thing not your twat sure
we love your clutter and it works
fantastic
didn't need it
nice nice
that a que that a que is nice well it's
also helped at a faster rate of fire yep
oh that's right you have your super
bullets - fuck yeah boom when are we
gonna get the compressor working we're
not is this Samora from the store we're
just not it's not gonna happen we've
given up on the compressor can you talk
to him
blank damage up oh that's neat
the compressor effect no the compressor
had the had the hiss the awful awful
hiss nose and there was just no work
around around we tried the special fancy
ass cables policy that's what that green
thing is there's like a there's a
necromancer
see faster than normal maybe put that
table boom yeah the compressor didn't
really do what we were looking for
anyway
it is being returned Oh ninjas West
Coast's no West Coast
the hiss is because you have an SM 1b
Jack you need a cloud lifter for more
clean game so what I weighed brave cadet
should I use the cloud lifter should I
use a cloud lifter with the compressor
and then what would it go would it go
Mike cloud lifter compressor or Mike
compressor cloud lifter tell me I'm
listening because we might have one I am
listening
we have a compressor limiter that's what
gave us the hiss come on brave cadet
tell me what to do
I'm listening ballistic boots ballistic
boots
ok so brave cadet we have a cloud lifter
the mics are hooked up to a cloud lifter
right this very moment
so Mike cloud lifter compressor ok is
the is the order if we do that
everything will be wonderful I will give
that a try I will officially give that a
try
Thank You brave cadet Mike cloud lifter
compressor and then we're gonna have
this sweet whoa that table flip thing is
cool is that causing like it's slow down
that's causing your computer to flip out
though no I think that's just full of
time or is it just awesome yeah brave
cadet actually a Jan Mike bought a cloud
lifter to use for commentary tracks
because we were having they were having
some issues with quiet microphones and
so we are actually hooked up through a
cloud lifter right now I didn't hook up
the limiter the compressor limiter
because I didn't know how to which order
to going you know place a large sock
over rich Evans head and it might fix
the levels that's that's not a bad idea
we'll give that a try look oh we want
those guys where do you get them the
magic key
I don't know luck may be involved not
sure never had a match key before Jack
oh I'm sorry I had one I don't know like
78 or I get a key to open that chest mmm
I mean you probably won open that chest
lipstick but-- sounds great whatever it
does okay i mean you can't afford it yet
are there more room okay
I got one to stay in the corner
yes
nice rich
rogue one has a trailer where a storm
triple trooper gets beat up by a stick
I believe it stormtroopers have
universally been proven useless in most
of Star Wars they can't hit anything
they always let the prisoners escape
they never find the right droids yeah I
get the ballistic boots oh all right but
now you have two things that make you
faster right
well foot speed and gun speed shit yeah
shit yeah
we should save some of this shit oh like
save a loadout I'm full I don't think I
can get anymore uh-huh why not are you
sure can't just add on and add on
seeking a gun you have to stop them
young bullets should heed my teachings
I've met him much before he's he's uh
nearly blind bullet he thinks you're a
bullet oh that's funny
telling me I have to stop me yeah yeah
so so he's going to give you a thing
does it give you one for free
oh no it's okay don't worry about it
okay I think they're saying here you can
buy as much as you want like you can
might just be able to keep adding to
your I can't afford anyway I'm surprised
cause there's that altar again I don't
particularly want to get rid of any of
the things I have yeah don't experiment
right now
meet
I say meat it's just a cube super meat
boy yeah this is just a thing now
anytime you see a cube yeah red cube
she's gonna be a meat bacon Jacobs says

hey guys hi cuz Nico :
rich what's your favorite Jennifer
Connelly movie
well she's naked and Requiem crackit The
Rocketeer or Dark City I liked her from
war that are hot hot ass as long as you
acknowledge the hot hot hot hot ass all
I get that's all I care about
just acknowledge the hot hot
tired and sad says think rich might
actually like Rove one because the
filmmakers have said this film will not
have a Jedi or any major mystical
elements as the main characters normal
people yeah that actually sounds great I
wrote one looks good the trailer looks
better than the Episode 7 trailer yeah
yeah ok pandering nonsense boss it's all
true and it's the falconer
yeah they had a lot of I'm gonna say
robe worn as a better trailer okay if
that's what you want to say it is what I
want so I'm not gonna stop yeah I'm not
gonna stop you from saying that and I'm
not gonna necessarily disagree with you
it looks more like something I would
want to watch not that I hated the force
awakens
of course you did of course I did
because I didn't slather it with with
with my man's seed your what's telegin
says rich watch 10 Cloverfield Lane
it is a breath of fresh air after Batman
V Superman anyway are you looking
forward to any future Cloverfield films
actually haven't seen Cloverfield Ted
there's not a not a part of that review
I didn't I didn't ask to go with the
movie I don't really care know anything
about it I don't know that's great I'll
watch it when it comes out Netflix
Oh what is it what's that do look at my
hearts oh you got two hearts okay but
here's the thing
any purchase will shatter the ring I bet
I get two hearts I just can't buy
anything Oh jack interesting interesting
what's your map
perhaps 79 has 78 I'm off by a whole
year I'm assuming that's a year or just
a number I'm not by a number HAP 78 says
rich do you believe in the theory of
alternate timelines and that by
traveling back in time you won't change
your current existence just create a new
timeline I think that Wharf TNG episode
parallels it's possible I look at the
problem with some of this stuff is it's
highly theoretical and there's no way
you can prove any of it
right now they might they might exist
it's a neat concept I'll say that but
the honest answer is I don't know how
time travel works and and nobody does I
don't know enough to make an educated
guess yes how I believe such-and-such
happens when you travel back in time I
am not qualified for that I'm just I
shit on Batman V Superman that's my job
that's my job did they ever find out
what happened to that s what is Batman V
Superman
it's gotta be around somewhere in the
versus yeah they asked that got dropped
in the vs. yeah oh no no never find out
lost some lost to the ages it should
have been Batman against five Superman's
yes stands for hope
oh I know why it doesn't have the s
because there is no hope in Batman V
Superman nice rich somebody nailed it
nailed it all over the place
damn Gina
nothing I really want to buy here anyway
there's this thing chlorine thei ring
but luckily there's nothing I want to
buy anyway so this sucks it can you buy
more armor ya know considering just I'm
not too big on it
I mean basically the heart right heart
right there's just bonus hearts all
right hold on switching guns to the
Emperor let's fuck some shit up we got a
bird rich
I wasn't setting myself up by the way
that was just that just came to me free

it's liked it and I wonder if that just
takes us down to the next level you know
and you say you don't have to fight the
boss who knows it's gotta be something
cooler that I you would hope so what's
up what's the price is right music duh
duh
okay the gungeon proper

a snake thing then that killed me once
Heat
dime eat
a moganda the mo conde yes for people
let me know there's great names of this
cap 78 says guys better Superman
Christopher Reeves or Tim Dave from the
animated series Christopher Reeves oh
it's the intermediate Tim Day is my
Superman he's a great Superman yep the
Bulbul fine they're both fine choices
you know the animated Superman to me was
able to do stuff like like action you
know yeah and have Superman be Superman
and like you know Reeves Superman yes
they did
what is our just voice not what they did
the show shit who was a better Superman
yeah still still of animated fuck fuck
you still animated nope
all right we've not Rives Jesus Christ
I can barely say anything right you know
you know this you all know this you guys
know who rich Evans is yes chat Nick
Cage was the best Superman did they ever
finish that documentary I think they did
I need to watch it about that The Death
of Superman lives yes yeah I really want
to see that what about Henry Cavill uh
shame he's never had a chance to play
Superman he might be fine you know rich
that was a sickroom
that's just a true statement is what
that is named meant doesn't burn
circle and shoot circle and shoot it's
my strategy it's my man strats works
like a child
ah you
fuck
I start breaking out the big guns I
still have that ammo resupplies so I can
I don't break out the big guns I won't
have you will get there I won't get ya
okay wait
I think I said sometimes you can shoot
it yeah oh hey hi oh shit what oh you
shot it's pressing the wrong button next
time use a key
oh it's junk okay was it junk dude next
time you know I came to shake you got me
next time he's the key sad tired sad
says RL I'm hinted in an email email
email that one of the main characters in
the movie that you guys did a commentary
track for is played by a famous little
person so does this mean the film stars
Tom Cruise No
I get it
you're gonna focus on moving too much
and it's gonna be a letdown when you
hear it it's a movie we do a commentary
track for hint it in an email eco
Colossus don't you wish for another
Death Star in the next Star Wars they
really haven't done enough with the
Death Star
I mean you haven't galaxies and sagging
to play with but come on
more Death Star yes and but and right
that's the whole purpose of rogue one is
them stealing the plans for the best so
the best art will appear prominently in
rogue well I think that's why they make
in the jail I I don't understand why
they blew up
Starkiller base and the force awakens
what are we gonna have another other
Death Star what do you do for the finale
of your your series now I don't I don't
get it I don't get it
not yours to get rich
all right how do I what's your special
right bumper right bumper
but do you switch that I won't care no
do it now I got use it what not your cuz
I'm you know what cousin fucked it up
used to it after this run I'm handing it
back to you alright so gonna get used to
it do I think they're going to attack
and blow up the Death Star and road one
do you not know what road one is about
or are they being funny they might be
being funny I think you're being funny
okay but for anyone who doesn't I'm just
wondering if they will might you end
that on a flashback kind of thing like
what what this character was doing
during the Death Star trench run could
that be a thing we see where somebody is
escaping the Death Star at the last
instant well no this is before our
episode four or possibly during I guess
possibly during but like we wouldn't see
the people battling the desert because
these are the people that stole the
plans so they could attack the Death
Star
maybe well right maybe maybe after they
transmit the plans they get captured and
then they're in like the prison
detention center and then you have like
you hear like or you kind of see because
the action scene of the detention center
with Princess Leia like you get to see
like the breakout of Princess Leia from
another characters point of view oh oh
maybe and then in the climax of rogue
run no I wouldn't no no she had she had
the plans
she had the plans in the opening scene
she had the plans on our to a new home
yeah no I mean but in rogue one they
could transmit the plans before they get
captured what the stars of rogue one
could still transmit the Death Star
plans and get captured and still be on
the Death Star
I get it I get it okay during the events
of a new hope sure and then you get all
these crowd-pleasing things where you
see the detention escape with Chewbacca
and Han
and then more they're escaping as the
Death Star's blowing up for the exciting
finale oh that would be mega lame I'm
just saying it's a possibility it's a
good possibility - oh okay here's an
altar I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to
Alvin Fox's the ending will be the first
scenes of a New Hope which is probably
right
I'm just throwing out this is a
possibility
I'm not even expressing that as
something that would be a good idea or a
bad idea just something that a Hollywood
Disney executive might possibly do with
the film hold on what if you find
another fire voice on your hand the keys
all right there Mike
I want my gun back
Oh No okay apparently I think you need a
specific item here like nothing happened
when I dropped my gun so I think you
need a specific item for the altar and
we just don't have it there is this gun
thing yeah and if this gun thing gets me
a new gun if you put two guns in you get
a new gun out I'm pretty happy with the
gun I have I might have to buy a heart
which will break my ring which gives me
two heart slots but not gonna do me much
good if I'm dead
Chad here's here's a question for you
the many Bothans died wasn't that Return
of the Jedi though and not a new hope
many Bothans died to bring us these
plans I think was my mama saying that
and it was in Return of the Jedi I don't
know who my mom I don't think anybody
necessarily has to die in rogue one to
get the plans I don't know what they
said about that a new hope well I think
Leia has the thing in a new hope about
like you know the people who got them
the plans are yeah you know also I don't
know don't care
Gold key selkie Oh Oh the selkie you
know the selkie yeah Mon Mothma said
that I think she's in rogue one yeah but
my mother mo was in Return of the Jedi
not into a whole new hope was admiral de
don de la right I don't think my mom who
was in a new hope you're saying a bunch
of work oh oh I gotta go I gotta feed on
do I don't know Star Wars name is I'm
not a super star wars freak
Admiral do done okay I've rescued
someone great cool well yeah I got you
another player I don't know any names
this one rogue one takes place before a
new hope that's all I know
which why do you hate Star Wars assuming
because I hate it so much I hate
everything about everything about Star
Wars rogue one trailer looks neat
I hate Star Wars hate it you're a raging
sea thing hate okay rich yeah if I spend
money to buy a heart I get it I get an
extra heart but then I lose the two
empty heart containers or you instantly
die depends upon how mathematically they
figure those two hearts I know I just
lose the two containers are you sure
about that yes
how are you sure about that I'm pretty
sure you're so you're not sure about
that is what you're saying I'm pretty
sure about that what you're saying is
you're assuming that and you're guessing
yes assuming yes so you're guessing that
yes then do it
anchor I can fuck your diet and get a
backpack
sure great got a backpack now cool I
should have bought that key how much was
that key thirty shit about the key oh
well fuck it by the boss

little that little bastard hit me I have
some extra guns now good I'm wrong with
that

like this guy is low on ammo and you
know the squirt gun I'm not gonna use
you get random sometimes you get ammo
drops around man just find them yeah

Oh Oh Ramon do you think phasma will
return an eighth disgraced and out with
a vengeance for Finn to be his final to
be his final confrontation like kylo is
for a for a preflight climax know I
think phasma will be completely
forgotten about you think yeah no she's
an on character and she doesn't even
have the cool factor that Boba Fett had
going on and what happened when Boba
Fett returned he died he flew into a
wall
I think she's going I think she is going
to be in the second movie because her
toys sold well but she's not gonna play
a major part in it I'm listening no
phasma's no phasma's no I'm gonna say
yes phasma's because of toys is
shit
can someone explosion DuckTales wants to
know i if somebody can explain why
people think boba fett is cool because
his outfit is really awesome that's
that's it that is it plus there's the
whole no talking acting like a badass
thing yep that's it that is it Boba Fett
that kind of mystique that diminishes
the more you you see and learn about
everything has happened with Boba Fett
like how much total screen time do you
think Boba Fett has in the original
trilogy total two minutes well you know
like we see him a little bit two minutes
two minutes including never on screen
for more than like ten seconds out of
his biggest appearance is Jedi yeah when
he wraps the thing around Luke two
minutes maybe like if we include all of
the slave one time maybe three or four
minutes there's some flying around in
space well I won't count a spaceship
flying around no and that was what how
long was that right
oh my god that was awesome I hit this
thing and rocks fell on the meat monster
oh yeah I see the X here what's it yes I
know we talked to him but he doesn't
talk much she says very little
yeah she's space Tom I think I need him
alive
generic badass tough guy yep fuck you
it's still relatively quiet a few words
he says who's the worst Lois Lane oh I
missed it
Amy Adams or something Bosworth I'm
assuming Oh was that from I'm assuming
from return yeah Amy Adams she screams
good it's not her fault of the script
sucks that that's the problem though is
like her Lois is nothing like she's a
fine actor yeah I know but her Lois is
nothing like I can't blame her Henry
heaven Henry Cavill might make him
really might make for a fine Superman
yeah you know what I could see Henry
Cavill beat like him he has got the
right look he there's little hints of
his acting ability
whenever zack snyder isn't paying
attention he can actually act luke 72w
says rich
I just watched every episode of Batman
the Animated Series best Batman or
bestest Batman ever yes yes yes a
possibly second bestest Batman ever
because his appearances in the Justice
League were always memorable
a shrine to the Forgotten bullet who
laid down his arms oh I could offer a
gun at the altar hold on
I don't want offer this gun I will offer
my SuperSoaker
oh I think I got a help for that nice
did you take my super soaker yes you did
awesome
awesome like was it the the Justice
League cartoon pilot episode where I'll
let you fight this spike you're out
you're empty
just gonna hide behind this wall yeah
you're doing great you're doing fucking
great I really enjoy games like this
you've got this shit down like you said
this is Maya this is my kind of jam
right here this is Jim Ian and all my
right gems but in the Justice League
pilot like Batman knob he beats up some
like foreign mercenary guys okay Eddie
starts you know interrogating them and
the four mercenary and some kind of like
Russian or something says you can't
understand what I'm saying and I won't
talk anyway
yeah and like Russian and then Batman
responds in Russian I can and you will
great yeah the animated series Batman
find Batman I know I know
but I did that's it
I need some fucking ammo Oh a shop hello
you got ammo huh that's that green box
yeah I know I'm just or you could get
rid of some shit you got the gun magic
gun box do oh I'd rather have ammo
Jeff shit you don't want give shit you
don't want what your guns hit but it
down hold down why okay okay yeah I mean
I have my standard which you know is
fine I ho you got rid of the water gun I
got rid of the water gun to get health
and that I needed that alright alright
alright so that makes sense
alright I'm gonna buy an ammo wait wait
hug the gun you want for it out you have
oh oh is that how it works I'm not a
hundred percent sure but yeah I'm gonna
say yes yes okay you alright
that only filled up the Emperor which is
fine that's a fine gun to fill up
alright that key or a half a heart Oh
probably want a key I think I saw a
little bit from The Killing Joke trailer
I'm sure it'll be fine look they got the
right voices for it I don't know what
kind of shit they're gonna add to it
like they're probably gonna add it a
gratuitous scene where Barbara Gordon
kicks all kinds of ass to make up for
the horrible horrible thing that that
story does to her yep
I'm sure to be fine oh that's a good one
that's a good run killed by your own
slow reflexes absolutely oh because like
I think I was like I was about to dodge
like it knew that I hit the Dodge button
but I didn't hit it fast enough
nemesis rich could you list the
live-action representations of Batman
from worst to best
oh you know I'm gonna exempt Adam West
I'm gonna exempt him sure he's doing
something different modern live-action
and then what the Batman we like yeah
the most part yeah sure can't be Batman
has its fans Karen prefers can't be
Batman the Exile this is as far the
farthest I've gotten in the game but
I've only played it tonight
where's George Clooney tie above that
I'm gonna say it's a tie Val Kilmer and
Christian Bale his voice is so tears
almost the entire thing we have now we
have Michael Keaton Michael Keaton Ben
Affleck yeah you know what I am you know
like Val Kilmer and George Clooney can
kind of be interchangeable because you
know Chloe Claudia is so shit no no
Cooper's not that bad Val Kilmer is
better than Clooney I think you got it
right I think you have it right he's not
that bad he's no George George Clooney
it is ridiculous to me that he is in
that movie still Adam West was doing his
own thing that that's that almost
doesn't even count as Batman anymore
that that's its own separate bizarro
right it's it's weird to rank him
because it's such a different
interpretation than most of them but
I'll say Adam
West above val kilmer and Kristen Bell
and below Keaton and Affleck
okay I could deal with that I could deal
with that it is but like it's it's own
thing you know it would be like putting
it be like putting the animated series
in there where it's like that's so
separate well that would be number one
oh of course but but it's also like a
whole different thing you know like or
we could talk about like the Batman
radio show you know but that's the thing
I'm like Christian Bale is a talented
actor but he has that Batman voice that
completely ruins any performance he
would give shy well you can't take him
seriously
and what he does the fake playboy stuff
it's so cartoony it is it's very
cartoony it's fun it's very cartoony
nerdy the the stark realism those movies
want to go for any time he's Batman and
not talking he's great like I'm thinking
about like that like him sneaking into
the into the building in where was that
in Korea or whatever like that whole
sequence like you know he doesn't talk
much that's fun it's fun Batman II stuff
gadgets and and intrigue and smoke and
mirrors for the most part the
live-action Batman's they just can't
move right because of the fucking
costume it it's true like III somewhat
recently ivory watched Tim Burton's
Batman oh here and just just because
that cost you oh it's horrible huh yeah
wait a minute it doesn't even like fit
on his face right it's horrible horrible
looks like it's made out of cheap rubber
and I'm sure they or more but it looks
like crap if Batman Baylor's Superman
Cavell I'd take evelle because I think
we could get a good performance out of
him who is this what who are what you
have to choose Batman Bale or Superman
Cavell super evil Superman cavil
look his problems been the script yeah
yeah and is that Snyder is the problem
not henry cavill right cavil won't give
it whatever k evil
henry cavill right and it's very clear
because there are little moments of his
superman that are really nice you know
like thinking back to Man of Steel
there's that whole sequence where
Superman gives himself up to the US
military and he has like a little
conversation with Lois Lane and you know
he's in handcuffs and they have a little
back and forth or the like you you let
him put handcuffs on you because you
know Lois Lee seen him lift mountains
and he's like I thought they would feel
more comfortable that way like there's
sweet little moments where cavil nails
the character and in Snyder completely
steamrolls over with his garbage Henry
Cavill is a robot and you two have bad
opinion it's true look I'm not saying
Henry Cavill is great what I'm saying is
we never get to see him try because he
hasn't been in a movie that's let him
try he might be shit I don't know is the
point where as I actively know I don't
like Christian Bale was Batman yep he's
had his chance Oh Tom Welling
Tom Welling is a you know that's a whole
different thing handsome man that Tom
Welling I mean all of them if you
playing Superman right you gotta be
handsome worst opinions ever I I will
defend I think if you put Henry Cavill
in front of a director who gets it with
a script that is Superman script you
will get a fine Superman performance I'm
maybe well we'll never know we'll never
know but I think based off of the little
things I like about his Clark Kent
Superman performance I bet I would bet
that we would get a decent performance
Jesse Eisenberg equals bad Lex
Christian Bale equals bad Batman
now you know we talked about this during
our spoiler discussion where it's like
the way he was playing Lex was okay it's
the script it's the director like get
Shia LeBouf to play Superman I don't
like Shia LeBouf okay all right okay
we're gonna call it them yeah we'll call
it them yeah oh yeah we got our alt-tab
