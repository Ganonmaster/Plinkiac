[C] say kill the this in a jar and all the
new by zombies collapse those little
green things flood around those are
zombie larva zombie bee larvae the
zombies in this game are zombies many
more boss fights are there much
everybody boss fights there are numerous
Lee I'm gonna say I'm about halfway
through the game you can go to bed I'm
not forcing anybody to stay in this be a
long stream
otice I know a shotgun I forget
why did the guns in this game suck
because it's a melee focused game that's
why the guns in this game suck
you better know it was Carlito then why
have them look I mean because some
people I enjoy them they're also not bad
to give the survivors right it's pretty
good to have a shotgun on you he didn't
mean to he was upset
I don't know what he'll do next hey hey
damn
oh yes
follow me
Oh Kindle are you there
Kendall you're great you're great except
when you try to have a mutiny later but
we'll deal with that then
right now I need a shotgun
Kendall follow me
don't know anybody down line
you keep shooting Kendall you're the man
I don't think the convicts were gone I
think I was just lucky enough that they
didn't spawn near me out there
you might Kendall shoot you shoot
santé juice
over there
think you are out right come on
essentially in the clear
son of a bitch
go
who is that is she hurt yeah you're
looking at the bad guys sister bad guy
the one who caused all this that's right
her asshole brother caused the zombie
outbreak
his sister
what in the hell is going on here I mean
does this have anything to do with that
announcement earlier I don't know much
more than you at this point okay but he
shot her I can tell you that and just so
you know that would be the same guy that
shot you
what's he after
what's his ultimate goal I don't know
but according to her his plan isn't over
not yet
fine consider her in DHS custody will
question her when she wakes out
who
like the dead Kendall's wearing a tux he
was yeah he's seven uh fancies of the
apocalypse
Tim this is an excuse to dress up
santé cabeza
all right got time to kill for a change
whom I attack one up that's good
what are my skills looking like right
now not bad not bad
item stops looking good you drop
we got the suplex hammer throw all right
love love my app so good with lovely
34 all right yeah
nice nice
all right I think if I could fly this
wine I got time to kill that seems like
a fine thing to do right now
yes I dunno Dead Rising I'm just I'm
terrified about tunnels no because I no
longer remember the most efficient route
through them and that section of the
game is going to give me a heart attack
goodbye baseball bad
so you know what I've got time I've got
time
oh yeah this is going down
bleh
yep there we go
relay
you know it's day 3 I don't think the
convicts spawn again I think that's the
last of them this is after midnight day
three so there they're gone
whilst my weight on the combat like this
is this is a gigantic mall but the park
is like twice as big as the mall is this
doesn't make any sense
my way
oh this isn't half bad time
yeah I should have grabbed another chain
so I didn't think it was that low on
health I'm kind of shocked it broke but
we'll be fine
what is your name Isabella Isabella
Keith well Isabella this is an emergency
so we'll skip the formalities and cut to
the chase consider this an official
interrogation tell me everything that
you know yeah those three magazines are
doing me a lot of good fine I'll explain
why all of this is your fault
there was no drug trade in Santa cabeza
just an American research facility they
were doing research on some sort of
parasitic insect like a wasp a wasp that
turns living things into zombies if you
don't believe me just ask the man who
was in charge of that research the head
of the Santa Kovac and livestock
research facility dr. Berube
Oh
I saw me Oh tell me the truth Darla were
you conducting experiments with zombies
zombies
who you were conducting experiments to
reduce the cost of breeding we
accidentally
mate zombie livestock so the
government's now in the zombie making
business the whole story about the drug
trade was a cover up what do you know we
were trying to mass my house cat I I do
not have the Mega Buster to you idea how
Americans
I'm slurring this because I'm undergoing
devising fatigue
one day in my village the people turned
into zombies it was damn waters they
escaped from the lab it wasn't long
before they got to work some spray the
army was building everyone I think the
first will be a house don't don't turn
your back on the guy who was just
turning into a zombie maybe that was a
bad idea for you
oh I'm not quitting I'm not that tired
we're doing this shit so it's going down
to terrorism as a retaliation for a
cruel government cover-up sounds
plausible or it could be some serious
bullshit in either case we have to get
out of here alive if we want to find out
for sure for sure for sure for sure

[D] No.

[E] Spanish?

[F] No

[G] not too late now they're gonna go and I
don't care wait a min

run up because of that
go
oh the guy accidentally killing oh well
if you guys can't keep up

it's been decided I feel bad but this
runs with two amazing let die fuck
as soon as Brad gets his hands on that
terrorist and I guess it'll be case
closed huh no you know if anything else
he could be planning no nothing about
the bombs

sure there's plenty of information on it
