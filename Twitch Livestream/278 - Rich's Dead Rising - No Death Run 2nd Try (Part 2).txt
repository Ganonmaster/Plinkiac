just more talk yeah what do you know
about all this anyway are you a reporter
let go I won't run so let go you're
hurting me
how much do you already know have you
called for help
hold your horses babe I'm the one asking
the questions here what is Santa cabeza
and how is it connected to all this the
zombies were created by you not us
that's what Carlito wants you all to
know who if you want to interview
someone talk to Carlito he has all the
answers you're talking about that guy
that took potshots at us with a sniper
rifle aren't you take me to him
no not now he's injured
and in no mood to talk to anyone
I'll bring him to you once he's
recovered I can persuade him I'm his
little sister after all
why should I trust you to bring him to
me
the zombies are a message from Carlito
he wanted people to know me
fine
go
when will you be back
tonight at midnight
wait for us in the store next to the
camera shop in the North Plaza
I'm Isabella by the way and I promise
I'll come back
whoo
so no my about halfway down here dear
Lord
time to kill a little bit of time to
kill
oops
screw can't be that good I'm hardly
saying anything
and mix mix tricks
all right now if you want to know the
next most likely place this run is gonna
buy it if we're good say if we're
considering the run ending when like May
if I fail the main story not just died
possibly in the tunnels it's been a
while since I've been through those
tunnels and I don't remember the layout
near as well as I used to so probability
of dying there is or at least failing
the main mission there the main story is
decent so now I'm worried about the
tunnels
I lost my bike but in one fashion
what is the queen item that's a that's a
penis it's a it's actually a these
zombies in this game are the product of
parasitic wasp

[C] say kill the this in a jar and all the
new by zombies collapse those little
green things flood around those are
zombie larva zombie bee larvae the
zombies in this game are zombies many
more boss fights are there much
everybody boss fights there are numerous
Lee I'm gonna say I'm about halfway
through the game you can go to bed I'm
not forcing anybody to stay in this be a
long stream
otice I know a shotgun I forget
why did the guns in this game suck
because it's a melee focused game that's
why the guns in this game suck
you better know it was Carlito then why
have them look I mean because some
people I enjoy them they're also not bad
to give the survivors right it's pretty
good to have a shotgun on you he didn't
mean to he was upset
I don't know what he'll do next hey hey
damn
oh yes
follow me
Oh Kindle are you there
Kendall you're great you're great except
when you try to have a mutiny later but
we'll deal with that then
right now I need a shotgun
Kendall follow me
don't know anybody down line
you keep shooting Kendall you're the man
I don't think the convicts were gone I
think I was just lucky enough that they
didn't spawn near me out there
you might Kendall shoot you shoot
santé juice
over there
think you are out right come on
essentially in the clear
son of a bitch
go
who is that is she hurt yeah you're
looking at the bad guys sister bad guy
the one who caused all this that's right
her asshole brother caused the zombie
outbreak
his sister
what in the hell is going on here I mean
does this have anything to do with that
announcement earlier I don't know much
more than you at this point okay but he
shot her I can tell you that and just so
you know that would be the same guy that
shot you
what's he after
what's his ultimate goal I don't know
but according to her his plan isn't over
not yet
fine consider her in DHS custody will
question her when she wakes out
who
like the dead Kendall's wearing a tux he
was yeah he's seven uh fancies of the
apocalypse
Tim this is an excuse to dress up
santé cabeza
all right got time to kill for a change
whom I attack one up that's good
what are my skills looking like right
now not bad not bad
item stops looking good you drop
we got the suplex hammer throw all right
love love my app so good with lovely
34 all right yeah
nice nice
all right I think if I could fly this
wine I got time to kill that seems like
a fine thing to do right now
yes I dunno Dead Rising I'm just I'm
terrified about tunnels no because I no
longer remember the most efficient route
through them and that section of the
game is going to give me a heart attack
goodbye baseball bad
so you know what I've got time I've got
time
oh yeah this is going down
bleh
yep there we go
relay
you know it's day 3 I don't think the
convicts spawn again I think that's the
last of them this is after midnight day
three so there they're gone
whilst my weight on the combat like this
is this is a gigantic mall but the park
is like twice as big as the mall is this
doesn't make any sense
my way
oh this isn't half bad time
yeah I should have grabbed another chain
so I didn't think it was that low on
health I'm kind of shocked it broke but
we'll be fine
what is your name Isabella Isabella
Keith well Isabella this is an emergency
so we'll skip the formalities and cut to
the chase consider this an official
interrogation tell me everything that
you know yeah those three magazines are
doing me a lot of good fine I'll explain
why all of this is your fault
there was no drug trade in Santa cabeza
just an American research facility they
were doing research on some sort of
parasitic insect like a wasp a wasp that
turns living things into zombies if you
don't believe me just ask the man who
was in charge of that research the head
of the Santa Kovac and livestock
research facility dr. Berube
Oh
I saw me Oh tell me the truth Darla were
you conducting experiments with zombies
zombies
who you were conducting experiments to
reduce the cost of breeding we
accidentally
mate zombie livestock so the
government's now in the zombie making
business the whole story about the drug
trade was a cover up what do you know we
were trying to mass my house cat I I do
not have the Mega Buster to you idea how
Americans
I'm slurring this because I'm undergoing
devising fatigue
one day in my village the people turned
into zombies it was damn waters they
escaped from the lab it wasn't long
before they got to work some spray the
army was building everyone I think the
first will be a house don't don't turn
your back on the guy who was just
turning into a zombie maybe that was a
bad idea for you
oh I'm not quitting I'm not that tired
we're doing this shit so it's going down
to terrorism as a retaliation for a
cruel government cover-up sounds
plausible or it could be some serious
bullshit in either case we have to get
out of here alive if we want to find out
for sure for sure for sure for sure


[D - 01h30m to 01h40m]
mopar you're wrong I actually do have
debt rising off the record on steam
rising off the record and the like job
Dead Rising 2 I know I have no right to
ask but please let me help if you don't
get out of here the truth dies with you
all right if allowing you to atone for
you and your brothers scheme makes
things go more smoothly for us I'm all
for it
what if this game never ends rich if
this game never ends that means I
successfully completed my no death run
there's a timer's game's gonna end and
no save oh boy no safety nuts no safety
nets right don't take care of some more
business
the problem is lack of chainsaws and a
boss battle to get to do I take time to
get the chainsaw I think I have to yeah
it's not gonna take me that far out of
my way I feel I really do feel so cheap
using those those small chainsaws but it
is a no death run from level one I think
I've earned it
I waiting on my drop that travel first
then drop
I've never used the minigun in a boss
battle before so this will be fun
yeah I know I know my Dead Rising woman
but those tunnels are terrifying me I no
longer remember the the most efficient
route through there and the time the
time constraints in that section of the
game oh it's gonna be a fucking
nightmare
those who reject salvation embrace
ignorant
No
shall return your tainted blood to the
foul earth that has spawned you
a little bit effective
straight
I beseech
all right
you need that I definitely want that
board brainwashing tips are you alright
oh shit
are you going get away from them it's
alright I brought food come on are you
alright
are you alright
yeah
over there I'll come back

[D - 01h40m to 01h50m]


[D - 01h50m to 02h00m]


[E - 02h00m to 02h10m]
level up here
summer summersisle kick that's fine
that's flying want the gut puncher
Oh
see what's your face or she not spawn
yes
hello everybody
yes
you know what she is one of my favorite
survivors Susan here here we are
date date three in the mall of the
zombie apocalypse oh really
before Frank West shows up at the moment
the zombie apocalypse has already been
going on for a few days a few days here
look look at this little is little old
lady managed to make it on her own for
like five days of nightmares zombie
health she's a tough old broad I love
her I always got to go out of my way to
save Susan come on
follow me
monsters already there are cases to salt
I've got a sinister zombie plot to stop
and I'm taking time out to escort you
because because you're wonderful you're
wonderful - well grandma who's tough but
I got places to go people to see
zombies to slice up same people to kill
Oh
this is the last I'm sorry
I might be able to do it I'm concerned
about exact kind of sort of getting lost
in tunnels and not remembering the most
efficient way through I'm worried about
losing a lot of time all if you Dan
we've got a regular suicide bomber on
our hands
then what you're thinking the explosion
would send parasitic larvae into the
atmosphere
he plans to spread zombies outside of
the city is he insane that bomb goes off
there'll be nowhere to run the zombies
will be everywhere he's planning to
flood the area underneath the mall with
flammable gas then set it off if you
could take care of the bombs while the
gas concentration is still low there's a
chance we could stop the explosion
let's do it
can't save
still that I get
who face crusher karate chap all right
all right I just want the gut Ripper
I'll be happy when I get the gut Ripper
god damn you own it
