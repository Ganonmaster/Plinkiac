about
ah yo what's up I got these car parks
have not been able to use them
which what do you think about the
Halloween follow-up what do you mean
Halloween - what the heck are you
talking about Halloween isn't
greasemonkey basically a useless perk
I'm going to see if they actually
patched it to make it work Riis monkey
is supposed to make you start the car
faster which would be extremely useful
but since the beginning of the game it
hasn't been working I'm wondering if at
this point they finally fixed it but I
haven't I haven't I haven't had an
opportunity to get behind the car and
really tested
you guys are going to review the games
again or just waiting for the right one
I guess writing waiting for the right
one
too many older games have been wanting
to get deep into and I don't wanna play
some just new shit I don't even care
about the first fucking place
you know Jack want to do that we'll call
me but he wasn't liking it and I I
didn't want to pick up a beloved cause
I'm just we get shit on it
I want to avoid the view that we are
contrarians I know I know I don't
typically have mainstream tastes and
games I just usually don't but I don't
want to feel like a contrarian for the
sake of being a contrarian so I wasn't I
don't really want to do okami
could they turn the Dead Rising series
around for you or are you done with it
well they probably wouldn't make a Dead
Rising game I like anymore they just
probably wouldn't
just as to I think I think fighting
games are far enough away from my
wheelhouse that I don't I don't know
that I could even give a worthwhile
review of it
I've read what they've done story-wise
with the injustice games and it's all
very neat alternate universe evil
Superman that's that's that's cool
there's no point no point letting
everybody know why here we go no I got
everybody no I got the fuse I got the
fuse if somebody knows where the phone
is
yeah I got all the show
we're going north ESMA yeah of course
the fastest way is across the water
to shoot her in the motorboat not the
four-seater and the motorboat really
really that's fucked up there's Wow
it should never be the two-seater in the
motorboat
fuck who is that God can't look
does anybody seen the phone no
all right I've got the fuse and I've
also dropped the battery off by the car
I'm about to drop off gas by the car -
it's trapped if somebody's got some
pocket knives does anyone have a shot
does anyone have a gasoline I've got it
right now the design taught me during
the boat
that sounds good it's the fastest way
there of course of course we're gonna
cross all the water Oh God
all the way across the water you're
gonna go there with no defense you have
to I can't I can't carry a weapon and
the gas I can carry a weapon or the gas
keys on the map yeah they are way away
from the car I'm going with the boat
wait is that the phone holy fucking shit
what what where's Jason
even I got a try right
need it it's fine it's all fine
Shakespeare he shifted when he got
through the door well she's smart I was
gonna wait till he got further in the
house before jumping out the door but
the Jason player was smart credit were
due and it was due hey
a steakhouse
Bridgers swim is so much closer anyone
need help someone anyone
let's not fuck it up this time
we need to get every last motherfucking
cop out here to Camp Crystal Lake Jason
is here do you hear me it's Jason he's
back
does anyone have a first-aid
my god
it's my work
it's too late for her why did you not
generally pass them out which is only
after insult I called the fucking cops
look at all there's the hard way
where we have virtually not that far
nothing I can do for nutmeg in
differential weapons I'm sure makes it
out
things spawn in different locations
every time you play those familiar
locations they're set spawning spots but
there's there's randomization what
happened to my shotgun I used it my plan
was when he got distracted by the cops
to everyone who was gonna run for the
exit with the cops I was gonna go take
the boat he was on to me he waited I was
able to Juke him until I got to the exit
that's that's this one's plan she's
going to the boat that's my guess
weapons are scarce or now with the new
update that seems that seems silly I
don't know about that I don't know about
that
I hope I'm doing this right
time to get out of a spot
she's so fuck
some attitude
that might have been a successful juking
no yeah maybe it's exciting
okay this game is so good yet so bad the
same time it's not bad come home this is
a good game and people got out because I
called the cops I did good I did half
good - I got nothing tips showing up I'm
gonna restart the tip Voltron and maybe
more tips will magically appear come on
or or don't I mean
hey what's going on everyone nope oh
yeah I got a few things just weren't
showing up earlier I had to restart the
program
Mega's Alexandros 86 is hi rich I'm
hijacking my man's account to thank you
for all your great work I wonder though
was tough time are you a cat or dog
personal my bed is a cat person or not a
pet person thank you so very much
skips common online game I always
someone like you who who fucking the
first to me I was daddy I wouldn't mind
a cat as a pet if I weren't allergic I
would not mind a cat as a pen but dogs
are lovable its pros and cons to each
cats are very hands-off and that's nice
a dog friendly but dogs responsibility
a dog a dog looks at you like family and
I'd feel bad if I didn't live up to that
can we play then you met there Kirk my
in charge thank you
I haven't at you being a counselor on
this map yet Ben Jason three times I
just want to play as a counselor right
now pet wise what I do have are fish
I've got some fish
I'll read more tips later
I'm not allergic I'm a little bit
allergic to Jack's cat it doesn't affect
me that strongly but I've I've had some
issues going there but I don't want that
I just want to unmute this person
I don't give a shit about the profile
worse but then just unmute look here we
go oh yes
you can tell I don't multiplayer game
Bunch I read I got the mad perk a first
thing I find a fucking map
first thing I find
yeah yeah yeah sure sure
then shall I walk past the window
we've got a car battery that somebody
dropped randomly motorboat the four
seater daddy oh great we got a
role-playing chat I think
Jason's right nearly near you where
where are you like way away from you
guys
guys help okay so far we found battery
nothing else do you think about a prop
not great multiple chance in bikinis
this is a fucking nightmare honestly
help anyone
tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me
where you at
I know shit
I got a problem I got a feller
you wanted to go and you go oh I got a
lot of gas yeah
his lines were previously recorded yes
oceans behind let's go
yeah
all right
who's playing this game who's playing
this game I'm an offline mode Arnott
yeah
white chart for Richard can you limit
the search that the friends thing to
just the game that you are currently
playing
I guess that not is that not possible
trying to try to play what chat here if
you haven't noticed what I'm doing
alright you can get an invite nobody
else is playing this game nobody I got
one I got one person
Friday and there isn't a search bar for
me to click on
there is there is no search bar
ah ask how do you have a better way to
do this
the out-of-game Frank Jesus Christ
I still don't see a search bar manage
friends lists remove by now some what I
want
no there's no I don't see a search a
search bar I just don't see one
we might not be playing with the chat
today
so Bobby settings
games deadish I know but I assume
anybody watching this who has the game
and wants to join in would would pop up
in the friends thing I wish they did it
where you can just pick a password for
your room and then anybody could fucking
find the room and get in if they had the
password why the fuck don't they do that
that would make so much sense
all right the cards flute I'm gonna send
this invite again but we can't do this
to people so
password rooms as old stuff now well the
work just fine
there work better this shit's working
options do I want to do you want to
watch me spend 15 minutes sorting
through miss teams list to see who can
go this is the thing we want to do
more than happy to humiliate myself and
one on the one yeah one on one one on
one it's just not much of a match in
general
oh all right Oh last I'm going 643 days
ago we can get rid of you right
come back come back you you window
no way I could sort this by activity
all right you can go
I'm so thrilling watching somebody try
to cold her friends list trying to be
nice I'm trying to find people that are
like a hundred days but I think I've
I've gotten rid of most of them by this
point where there's 39 52 days you know
all right fine
48 days all right 643 you're out of here
in 24

be an honor to kill a hero
I'm still here I'm still here
who is that can't look everything's fine
everything's fine
what's going on all right
someone's shooting I I have I don't know
where you're getting that accusation
from I have no idea where you I've no no
accusations of cheating have been made
let's see Jason in a while though not
seen Jason in a while
strange but true
I need to work on talking this is gonna
happen I know I know it's something I
need to work on but you know it is what
it is I am me what's going on in the
game absolutely nothing absolutely
nothing it's suddenly to come a rate
yeah but it's peak of a radius stream
where I really can't describe what I'm
doing that's kind of out of the question
all right what can we do what can we do
I can't say what I maybe can or can't do
it's weird predicament this is weird
situation we're in here today a lot of
people who walk in are gonna think the
stream is over because it says and when
I am clearly still here me still being
here is a thing
do about this
now I just have to look for something
look for something I've got a radio
maybe other people can talk that's
interesting
hmm that's interesting I don't care to
be more specific
mai-chan if I found that why would I say
that out loud why would I say that out
loud
fucking up
what's going on here we can work this
out what's going on here I'll let you
know if I find rich
what am i lost yes I do I got other
things too
rip
I'm probably not gonna make it out of
here alive but I'm gonna try could use
some mile never mind
viewers dropping like flies probably
probably
nice
Jason's killing my friends
please get out here no this is not a
priori
is it really such a victory when you
stream tonight so I still got the
fucking phone up and running
okay
fuck you Jason
know what some more
tense
alright that was pretty good that was
pretty good
that's my good boy
mommy has a reward for you come home
the game
not really just wait until I'm Jason
there's this one guys really unlucky
I was right next to that guy when you
did then that's all that shit and heard
you all right gonna make some room for a
one new pre people one new people all
right I'm gonna look for more people to
invite her

friends list precisely one

this game so I can invite you Davos
already in
how what's already in
Artie and already in
if I just accepted your invite be
playing this game or I can't invite you
into the game you need to be playing the
game or we could just played down a man
which is what we're gonna do I think
spending far too much time looking for
people to have them join

MVP last game you get to be Jason
congratulations and ready up whenever
you're ready to go our Miller you'll

today so it's me going alone
Elena playing a little bit of Friday the
13th
we'll come back to that I'm gonna say
out loud too much about what's going on
in the game unless I'm playing this

very true
Erik the Lord says thanks for being my

never I had I had all right here's what
happened once we had a stream and I
deleted someone to make room
they sent me like a message saying why
did you leave me Oh
clearly it's the prestige of being
friends with fridge Evans it is a
prestige it actually is I think I don't
get it but that's what it is
all right
this'll be the finale I will be playing
as Jason
good luck we've seen the new one I'm
gonna I'm gonna stick with part six
fucking fucking
but Michael Myers got added to this game
now that's that's actually dead by
daylight that has Michael Myers it would
probably be considerably more of a
hassle to get Michael Myers added to
this particular game
