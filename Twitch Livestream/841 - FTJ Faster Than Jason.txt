krabby patty the krabby patty
yeah the krabby patty it is right we'll
be playing unnormal you know anyway
they're named sour grapes no it'd be
funny if their name were sour grapes it
would all right so we got a mentorship
we have a captain nitpick but no sour
grapes oh they would have been a good
captain for your ship oh well too late
where's unpause jump Joe yeah we are in
normal normal is your pussies fuck off
oh no I'm pickle Hitler thay hopes that
something awful happens to me
wow-whee look here's the here's the plan
the night I'm doing one run of FTL I
don't know
Manta ship and this is a an airless
Scout ship we can't board it that's
unfortunate
this don't look very insect io and then
after FTL I'm doing more Friday than
13th god damnit I think Jake is still on
vacation part two or else he's
recovering from vacation part two
or maybe he picked up rabies from his
mom's dog I don't know he'll be back
Sunday right should be
that's pretty easy
they want to know rich your opinion on
the Friday the 13th patch news I don't
know anything about the patch news
what is the patch news other people are
saying that the screen is getting cut
off and they can't see the left half of
the screen
alright I'll fix it the second I was
gonna say forever what was my reaction
too rich telling me he makes Internet
videos as a decrepit old man with a
broken VCR I've known rich quite a while
I knew rich before during and after his
stint as decrepit old man it's kind of
so during yeah let's not let's not jump
the gun just yet it's all over kid well
sometimes blanket is you and sometimes
blanket is Mike and the whole thing is
kind of confusing oh I respect rich less
now that he is a Sony executive as far
as I know he isn't but Sony executive
sounds like it's good paying so
congratulations rich blanket is Mike
Evans alright we'll get a ship we can
actually board this time no more team
killing and counselors will be able to
emote wait no more team killing no no
that's part of the game
how do I feel about dating someone who
gradually became a celebrity well this
is small Cecil of Verdun yeah
also I'm glad that he's able to do
something that he enjoys instead of
doing something that he doesn't enjoy
simply to make money we're gonna
reassign some people all right there we
go
all right playing as a fucking mantis
ship I've not run across one ship we can
board okay here's our first tip and
watch it old best the worst episodes and
have to ask why did you just stop after
the W V world matrix and the amazing
bulk and just say fuck this fun to do as
miserable as it can be you'd miss it
so these ships have different
atmospheres don't you have like a
respirator or well they either have an
atmosphere or none and no for gameplay
reasons you can't wear a respirator you
just fucked I wanna know if you've ever
tried darkest dungeon a little bit yeah
wasn't so into the style of combat
there's a lot I liked about it oh that's
right the the screen thing what about
they want to know if you've seen Brolin
as cable makeup test shots Brolin those
who as cable makeup test channels I have
no idea I don't give a fuck about the
x-men or cable so it's not something
I've really looked into last time I
talked to your brother about German
stuff you really loved it well that's
cold um I'm making some kind of use out
of the four years of high school German
that I still remember oddly enough a
little of it's a cool language all
languages are cool the fact there are
different languages is cool cool kind of
an ambition just come beyond me and be
Essen what don't you say random shit get
it all right ash vs. Evil Dead I think
you've seen all of those ah liking it so
far
I don't TV show right yes liking it so
far I don't know what they're gonna do
for the next season kind of worried
about it yeah you know what
I could I could use these guys to delay
the rebels or I could just flat-out if I
stopped okay sorry no you're not go on
sorry
no you're not go out lissa greetings
from Germany and notice this is what
they're finding Staton I think okay I'm
kind of debating whether or not I should
fight these rebels or use them to fight
these pirates these these mercenaries or
use them to delay the rebels is that
like a hail Hydra logo probably inspired
by it but technically it's just a pirate
logo a purple octopus see yeah
oh wait a minute it's an octopus with
the like a skull like crossbones behind
it yeah sorry those aren't words like a
tentacle skull with crossbones because
octopuses have skulls well they're
aliens it's like an alien thing look I
may be alien ox
yeah I have skulls or maybe aliens have
octopi like faces have you thought about
that maybe don't think I've like no
squid they have like one-eyed octopuses
have two eyes can they want me to stop
abusing you am i abusing you in any way
shape or form
oh oh oh make it stop make it stop
really did you just say no how about I'm
fighting aliens are just humans with
bumpy heads it seems to work for the
Star Trek universe my day has been
lovely I hope yours just been as well
rich and karen says hyper hyper as
starters hyper Oscar is whatever
apologies rich and Karen I'm thinking of
going to Chicago what's your favorite
deep-dish place dear dot Giordano's Papa
Gino's any place you'd recommend for
Chicago dogs well I know I know what you
and your mother are super fond of pizza
it depends on and where you're going if
you're going to be anywhere near the
south suburbs there's a place called Lou
Malnati's that has fantastic deep-dish
pizza in my humble opinion Giordano's is
very good not dominos dear Dennis is
very good or Pizzeria Uno and pizzeria
do a downtown although they can be a bit
expensive and a bit crowded but yeah
O'Donnell's is definitely quality pizza
and Lou Malnati's is is very good but I
don't know I think Lou Malnati's is
mostly in the south suburbs
also a few if you want to get non
deep-dish I'm not sure why you would
want to get non deep-dish because
Chicago is all about the deep-dish but
beggars Pete's I think is one of the
better thin crust
yeah in the Chicago area and there's a
number of those around you good pizza
pretty much anywhere that's not chained
hot dogs you know I'm not I wouldn't say
I'm a hot dog kind of sewer necessarily
I mean Portillo's if you'd remember them
there they've got good hot dogs they've
got good everything they've got very
good grilled vegetable sandwiches in
general I'd say anything with Vienna
beef hot dogs it's probably a safe bed
long as you got a Vienna beef hot dog
and I and a nice fresh bond condiments
are kind of condiments
do I like beard rich better or baby's
face rich better
well the beard the beard looks a little
strange at first but then at one point
he went and shaved the beard and it was
like yep put the beard back I like the
beard it's like too much like a baby's
butt otherwise like a baby's butt huh a
typical Chicago dog add veggies and crap
like that well I like veggies I'm like a
everything but the kitchen sink on
sandwiches and food and stuff kind of
person but usually chicago-style hot
dogs involve pickles and sport peppers
and and celery salt and mustard tomato
onion potentially supposedly supposedly
it's an affront to Chicagoans if you ask
for ketchup but in truth pretty much any
hot dog stand in Chicago is gonna have
ketchup and nobody really gives us shit
if you ask for ketchup you like ketchup
get ketchup
rich do you remember Scarface the movie
uh yeah I remember Scarface that's the
reference in the play over here okay
the beard worked for Jonathan Frakes
Frank's babyface bum chin I liked his
butt babyface balm Jim though that
Jonathan Frakes was a cutie when he was
younger he's handsome still the beard is
an easy way to determine whether or not
it's a good or bad episode of TNG
Tiffany I agree with you
DJ demon that yellow mustard tends to be
an inferior product I tried to convince
rich of this once and accidentally found
out that he really hates mustard period
I got him some good brown mustard and he
hated it even worse but yeah yellow
mustard is usually inferior to uh it's a
nice coarse ground real mustard I have
not tried the processed horse penis and
Chinese people hotdog variety yet maybe
maybe in the future the far distance to
try it distant future we're gonna try it
ready try something that's something
stupid what do you think of the new Star
Trek Discovery trailer
I haven't even washed the show kind of
lost me before it even started
this is gonna work out great or horrible
that was risky I tried a boarding
procedure aa on a ship that was getting
ready to leave which means I could have
lost my crew when the ship left but we
were able to take down the ship before
that happened I know that that's all
over your head well I get the concept
ship leaves your people around there
they can't leave all the ship is moving
because they'll get hit by asteroids or
something well I try the Orville or skip
it oh I'm looking forward to the Orville
the Orville looks like it's going to be
a loving Star Trek parody in the vein of
shot of the Dead where it's kind of both
parody and it also obviously loves the
fuck out of the original material do you
think the formula of doom 2016 can be
approved improved upon I don't know what
I would do off the top of my head but
sure is gonna be maybe some kind of new
and interesting enemy all right Tiberius
I was wondering where you were you seem
like you're usually here and I'd noticed
that I didn't see your name this is bad
this is not the ship we want to fight I
don't want to see anything with a
fucking zoltán shield Cabbage Patch says
Karen rich told us have you told us you
got him drunk one drunk once or twice
what was rich like in is Annie Bree ated
state like rich slightly sillier but
like rich super what dumb wasn't really
expecting anything in particular
the the funniest story I've got about
that is when you had your wisdom teeth
taken out and you were like pretending
to flatline and protecting
diet stuff as a joke and just generally
big silly but that was you know whatever
they sedate you with for conscious
sedation for dental procedure fuck this
chicken buttocks chicken Mik buttocks
says do you think rich will ever name
you heiress to the rlm prereq fortune
he's not allowed to die ever
so it's irrelevant
Oh
hot hole home video says rich remember
Vietnam remember my mother yeah we
remembered as Vietnam like it was half a
decade before our birth I got some other
reference to something very old can I
tell rich an inside-joke
only you two would get hmm I have to
think about that I think of one I still
wouldn't do it I only got an aunt a
boarding drone that's not good rich yes
yes yes 20 bucks I know and we won't
explained it to you because it's an
inside joke
have we ever been on the kiss comic am
at a baseball game we have not and every
time we're at a baseball game I always
hope we will be I do gotta get ready so
we can guess if they but it's never
happened it never even happened at the
minor-league games we go to some of
which are far less attended than some of
the big big league games to get out a
fire off I want auto fire on now
Disney has their own convention now
obviously they will start their own
streaming service I read something today
that in I think it's in 2019 Disney is
parting ways with Netflix which I don't
really care because I mean like they
have wanna on there and they had Jungle
Book on there but for the most part like
all the Disney movies that you might
want to see the classic animated Disney
features are not on Netflix now it's
just like you know Disney Channel movies
aimed at 10 year olds which probably
have a huge annoying fan following but
I'm not really part of it they want to
know what sector you're on first I think
right now ii know this is the first not
I'll tell you service shortly and et and
then says they bought fto last night and
they loved it
oh this games great why'd it take you so
long I demand to know why it took you so
long
damn the Disney Vault awho if you
haven't seen the video about vault
Disney I suggest you do so Netflix
doesn't have it but other things do
sector 1
we're not Netflix Oh YouTube doesn't
have it though other things do decent
amount of scrap but that's what happens
when you do boarding Aladdin is your
favorite Ladin was a lens great Aladdin
because of Robin Williams it's good good
music - it's fun story lens all-around
good not just because it Robin Williams
baseball baseball accommodates all
levels of enjoyment from one to your
background noise to obsessive
statistical modeling it does it
definitely does it's also you know easy
to keep track of you can listen to it on
the radio or you can just have like
go-to MLB's you know thing and it'll
show you just the the pitches of stuff
and you can look at it every once in a
while and keep up with a game if you're
kind of half paying attention baseball
you can pay as much attention or as
little attention as you want to and
still kind of follow what's going on
pretty lucky focus stumbling yeah this
is well this is fairly Ural friendly
maybe I guess it's like midnight 43 or
something in in Deutschland and most of
Europe but it's not as ridiculously late
do the other heirloom dudes go to
baseball games probably not no geeking
out about unaffiliated minor league
teams that very few people in the world
care about us rich is a nice thing do we
ever go to Brewers games once in a while
we haven't been this year I love that
their stadium has a roof and if the
weather is shit you they just close it
up corn belters I have been we've been
to a corn belters game and normal I
think that they're stoned looking ear of
corn logo is kind of awesome
I wish I could get off their mailing
list every time I like unsubscribe from
one of their mailing lists somehow
another a new one sprouts up and I'm
getting more mail for the corn belt errs
which you know I don't live anywhere
near normal nothing against them I just
live anywhere near them mantis is your
favorite team where's mantis in front of
the brew crew are fighting for first
yeah they're there they and the Cubs are
neck-and-neck but whichever one of them
ends up taking the division is
definitely going to have to step up
their game if they want to win
you know this good night and and also
much fun with Friday the 13th thank you
Condor man one
oh the White Sox are unbelievably awful
this year
yeah that's life yeah I kind of I kind
of tried out to think about it too much
the Dodgers they're the ones in like
with like the 700 that the Dodgers are
that though yeah I think it's the
Dodgers somebody's got a record over
right now that's like 700 something
which is just on Godley yeah the Sox are
definitely in full rebuild they're there
and why not I mean what they're doing
what they were doing is not working
do I like National League rules or
American League rules better other than
the designated hitter thing I don't know
what much different another difference
well I think questions do you prefer the
BH or not yeah
tentatively and there's more strategy
with this there is more strategy a lot
more yeah punting and whatnot
I guess question is do you like watching
aging sluggers crank out home runs or do
you prefer watching
titters pitchers fun strategically right
h3o plus basically in the difference
between what we're talking about is in
the American League and the teams that
are in the American League the pitcher
doesn't bat when it's the pitchers turn
in the rotation when everybody but the
pitcher has batted they have a
designated hitter who does it in the
National League that pitcher bats as
well here are my thoughts about the
ditch I like it as like something that
separates the Ale from the net from the
arc numerically from the National League
it's like they have their own identity
thanks to the D H I like that you can
make an argument that it when it comes
down to the World Series and interleague
play but more importantly the World
Series it's a pretty major handicap to
the American League team because they
play in the National Park yeah but they
don't they don't cultivate a designated
hitter designated hitter designated
hitter designated hitter

[B] they don't have someone on the roster
why can I get anything else but you hit
good and then when it comes time in the
world series they need to designate
someone as a hitter well I don't really
but it's a disadvantage for the American
League teams in the National League park
because they're their pitchers hardly
ever
there's always fuckin bunt or something
stupid anyway some of them I mean you
know I mean like Carrie what did a
homerun in one of the playoff games
there are pictures who there have been
multiple pitchers who did not suck ass
at pitching
I love batting what I love I am blessed
to but it isn't I'm not working with any
kind of strategy where that would be
useful I'm thinking if I get a drone
control ship I might find a boarding
drone at some point and that would go
well with what I'm doing
yes calling it the World Series when
it's 29 US teams and one Canadian team
is indeed silly I think it's the only
sport that does that though the fire
drone if I can find some rock men fire
drone and rock men as a boarding party
oh god that would be badass that would
be badass
don't you agree Karen that's your part
it's great keep reading keep reading
that's what I'm here for
it's my function in life your function
is to talk to the chat will I get
absorbed into the game how was our
one-eyed fish he's doing okay we
explained the whole story about our how
he briefly go over it again okay so we
have a we have we had a 15 gallon tank
and now we have a 15 gallon tank and a
10 gallon tank and the 15 gallon tank
has danios a beta a couple of Amano
shrimp and a snail one of the the
smallest Daniel was getting harassed by
his
Heol not a school yeah apparently a show
is a fact that he has one I tells you
everything you need to know they've
basically been killing one of their own
and we wanted to stop that from
happening so we put them in our
isolation tale - we don't know if they
ate his eye but they definitely ate his
tail know when I'd fish is not a
euphemism for anything else this is a
fluorescent yellow fish one of those
genetic freaks the glow fish Daniel's so
we put him in an isolation tank and he
grew his tail back we tried to put him
so anyway we wanted to set up a second
tank anyway so we set up a second tank
with nano fish with Guppies and Cory
cats and some more shrimp and there's a
bunch of pond snails in there that we
might have to do something about at some
point so we he started going after the
Guppies and we put him back in with the
danios and they herded him into like was
about two square inches in the corner so
right now he's back in with the danios
but if he starts messing with the with
the Guppies we might have to like
euthanize him or something because it's
not really fair to him to have him in a
two and a half gallon isolation tank by
itself the other danios want to kill him
so he better be nice to the Guppies yeah
he's still kicking he's a little fighter
missing an eye he was missing half his
tail but that grew back
I only got four drones I don't know that
drone control is worth it right now I
think I need to go all in on boarding
well I mean yes what Laker tickets
course but I just can't we just can't
watch the danios slowly and tortuously
torturously eat pieces of this other
Danny oh well he suffers the other
because somebody's a baby other Daniels
weren't picking on Anna maybe was
starting shit and losing I don't know he
spent a lot of time hiding he was he
spent most of his time in that back
whenever he came out they'd be all over
him yeah most I'm hiding behind me he
almost died hiding because he got caught
Ned we had around the filter house Kevin
senior r2 unit explode that sounds like
a that sounds like if that's that dirty
it sure sounds like it
Danno a fish from Hawaii five-o maybe oh
we had the flushing or eat him groan
groan do something like a board
do we do it we'd do it again
did we do it again we're gonna do it
again rich tell us the most politically
incorrect joke you know yeah we're gonna
start a nuclear war I don't have any on
hand it's just like a joke remember the
fish would eat me if I had the chance he
might but you know without any malice
just go op clop clop clop the beta I
think already wants to eat me whenever I
open the thing and I start like putting
little pieces of food in he jumps up and
tries to ties to take him straight out
of my finger you can take out the rest
of the screw any time the guy's won a
cow would not eat me and everyone I care
about but a deer might I've seen videos
of deer eating birds and what's on farty
scary
Texas pain here am i my bait is really
chill he leaves everybody else alone he
just doesn't give a shit he cares about
food about food and chilling out on a
fake plant
feels like a toilet flushing yeah we got
fires and I got no censors on this ship
which I should probably invest in if I
want to get full you said that mind
control I wasn't thinking about that no
I haven't tried the mirror thing with
the baby yet I imagine he might flip out
then again he might not I mean he just
spends his time either either swimming
around trying to find food or just
laying half upside down on a plant so
you think he's dead rich it would be
really nice to see you try the hard mode
mmm maybe with some practice haven't
played too much in a while Anonymous's
here's money so at least someone profits
from my solitude and unemployment you
expensive hacks $0.10 per characters
more expensive than a sex hotline but
also more enjoyable I'll give you that
ten cents per carat is that what the tip
works out to I don't think so if the tip
is two dollars and it was ten cents a
character it would be twenty characters
there's probably more than 20 words
there there you go we're not tightwads
see you were wrong about everything and
everyone
oh they're saying it's a cent per
character 200 character limit
if you want to find a way to use every
character and get your money's worth you
can go right ahead although if you want
me to read it aloud you probably should
put some spaces in there so it's legible
well there's my if I ever considered
being in on a wheel the worst episode
maybe someday I'm not a huge fan of bad
movies damn it
maybe I could just be like Vanna White
and I could just spin the wheel for you
and now we need to do some repairs rich
has anyone ever told you you look like
Les Stroud from Survivorman no I would
the fuck is list route
I guess he's the guy from Survivor man
okay
every rock man I love me some
teleporters
if this game was a hot pocket what
flavor would it be I said crab flavor
please Karen best of the worst has
devolved into a total sausage fest I
have never hurt you guys referred to as
the sausage fest before googling stroud
damn stroud sure wishes he looked like
rich so completely changing the subject
I got a book out from the library I'm
reading called the ghost map it's about
the cholera epidemic in London and I
finally kind of think I know the
difference between mud larks Tosh's and
Knights oilmen there was like a whole
economy revolving around guard recycling
garbage and shit for money in London in
the Victorian era
alright shet do we want a mantis or a
rock man
what are we looking for zoo dish what's
the what's the assignment
Rockman alright we're going with the
rock men
yeah it's nonfiction
all right Jenny Otis have a gender ratio
issue we need two to three females for
every male where the males will harass
the females I always assume perhaps
incorrectly that our big fat purple
Daniel was a female and just up until
recently she had been completely
dominating every other Daniel in there
yeah and the other one is is shaped just
like that Danielle also probably female
that is now the leader of the pack and
cephalo is one I saw me over there I
need to name two other people her quelle
Wolverine I'm Steph lol oh I forgot
how's it spelled I don't know how they
spell it but like encephalitis and Seth

amazing yeah all right what are your
stats like pretty good pretty good
you can go here and and you can wait in
the oxygen room cuz why not I lost am I
gonna have any vibration room listen
yeah life's basically life support
detector pirate they do not have medbay
all those fools Jack is on vacation Jack
will be coming back though
again they take the same the same
menagerie along with them this time I
have no idea I have no idea and the in
the thick of things here in the thick of
things
all right I think you might have gone to
the farm I don't know where the farm is
I think for this run I could I could
really use a cloning bay oh boy
oh that fires in my ship well that's not
good well I got rock gun what am I
worried about it for is that like a
force field around your ship that
honeycomb pad yeah
shields standard standard Star Trek
procedure
humor K famine is the cause of wars and
Wars the cause of famines it kind of
works both ways
unfortunately do I like this game I've
never actually played it it's great it's
kind of boring to watch but then yeah
damn that is boring to watch this fight
at the 13th though I am you bring the
watch is Friday the 13th at boring watch
you kidding
kill kill kill run run run oh no no
you're thinking call of duty who will
survive how do they survive that's
Friday the 13th is about what do they
what do you think of removing team
killing and three smaller maps well I
think he already said that's not like
the idea of removing team killer that's
part of the game how do they remove it
they just make it impossible to kill
team mate yeah what happens with a
standard for the car
so right when you alright with this in
from the car okay I figured team kill
meant you're cooperating to kill
something does team kill me you're
killing your teammates yes why would you
do that take this pot in the car to get
out more frequently because you're a
jerk
Tamagotchi stream you can probably find
a version of that for a computer is that
the only thing they're changing in the
update chat what what else is being
altered I can't imagine that's it
I know goodbye what I like I mean I
don't have any taste I'm not much of a
gamer spoiler maps also free emotes for
michaelis people smaller maps like new
maps smaller versions of the maps no
these are all terrible ideas they're
replacing all the weapons in the game
with walkie-talkies I set a reference to
ET rich I was not aware that you weren't
executive at Sony neither was he haha
that the day before
beautiful and unique alright who wants
to be this person who's going to kicked
off my shift the minute we find a better
crew member currently in progress our
three new map variants 40% smaller
promote faster paced gameplay and eight
being added for free as well in an
upcoming patch again if we can disable
the smaller maps on I'm okay with that
I don't want faster gameplay I don't
even think that would work good
oh are we picking new names yes I think
it's a terrible idea uh psychedelic
chainsaw he or she says he or she will
die for the cause which is probably true
sec Jane no no that's a bad deal for me
so they so listen Frances like Vaughn
dirty the whatever 13 is in French what
I'm just wondering if the French call it
like Vaughn Judi the whatever 13 those
are Friday 13th is a superstition even
making it makes any kind of sense in
France I don't know they might have a
different name just out of necessity I
figured the superstition around the
number 13 is probably pretty universal
in Europe Zoltan super shields mantis
they're gonna be on the same playing
field with fighting Evangeline super
shields valve on dirty is Friday because
luis von dirty was the the uncle which
is kind of cute in Friday the 13th the
series which had nothing to do with
Friday the 13th and Jason Mart is 13
that's what Tuesday
the game's called Tuesday the 13th it's
Vaughn dirty 13 something about
murdering Knights Templars in Friday the
13th is that why I thought 13 was just
like I don't know I figured if their
team was like supposed to be an unlucky
number because in Argentina is called
Tuesday the 13th that's interesting I
figured that the 13th thing I didn't
know why Friday specifically but I
figured the whole 13 thing that's
because 12 is like kind of like a
special number due to a number of
cultures and 13 is like you know more
than 12 but then I'm gonna win at 11
someone is in in Spanish in
spanish-speaking countries or Latin
influence countries it's Tuesday the
13th fucked his day that's interesting
no Big Apple that's why six was Afraid
of seven thirteen is a baker's dozen but
a baker's dozen is a good thing it's
like you get an extra donut or something
hi Amba 91 I got FTL from your
recommendation for two dollars and fifty
cents great values as cash G cos yay
whatever apologies and pronunciation
either way have you tried Alpha Centauri
yet you have it on galaxy of games it
may well be your cup of tea not yet yeah
so many games so little time yep that's
kind of how breaks down what happens if
your ship blows up with a crew aboard we
could die right yeah like my ship if my
ship blows up just game over if their
ship blows up with my crew aboard those
crew member who are aboard the ship that
explodes they're dead each reven says
the same day I watched that antibiotic
Rhett rant I was prescribed antibiotics
rich put the fear of God in them me
sorry oh you should use antibiotics
properly
well yes would you like to explain as
well we'll just really hammer at home
about not using them for viral
infections or why not about not ending
your prescription really just know why
this is Matic resistance why this is
like super duper important which part
anytime anybody uses antibiotics for
anything they're creating a situation
where germs could become resistant to
antibiotics because germs mutate like
crazy
and some of them are gonna be immune to
any given thing and if those get passed
down to other places especially if you
don't take your full prescription and
they go and multiply and then go jump
into somebody else and be all anti bad
for this and that's bad and if you take
antibiotics for a viral infection it's
not gonna do squat because the processes
in bacteria which are living things
which antibiotics interfere with those
processes aren't going out in viral
cells hey they're viral entities I don't
even know if you call them a cell
Frankford on mine it's late there huh
like 1:00 in the morning so we talk
about something that doesn't end in a
world ending through a viral apocalypse
sure do we want to talk about the
Yellowstone Caldera
or gamma-ray bursts
pointed just the right way or the heat
or heat death of the universe or the Sun
swelling up for that's not for a few
billion years we presume well thank you
Steven girl steam pink girl I will be
right back okay
she'll be right back
is this a rerun hi look you I'll do that
rich do you consider your leading style
more Picard or Kirk I kill everything so
Kirk look her wouldn't kill everything
no he'd fuck a couple of things
especially oh that's that's also that's
also the comical exaggeration of Kirk
the stereotype of Kirk

[C] Oh Mike Janeway yes yes Janeway yes she
would get everything killed even her own
crew yes I'm playing like Janeway yes
we're also we're also gonna get lost in
space we're doing great
Zapp Branigan Oh
Futurama
guardzilla and other Touhou films were
marketed as Frankenstein films in
Germany Germany tended to market all big
monster movies as though dr.
Frankenstein had created them this is my
contribution to the different names for
the Friday the Friday the 13th in other
countries well what was that I missed it
the claiming that the they were that
they marketed the Japanese the the
Japanese
Godzilla movies and is Frankenstein
movies and blues accrue Germany we might
lose a crew member pride of
nutsack Branigan because he never fights
the space spiders for their silk
tapestry there's some people lovely
notes of their death but he's not very
smart about it I'm gonna say I'm
generally smarter first of all I can it
on a place jack second no Jack's gonna
be back
far the 13th was mistranslated in Turkey
as the 13th Friday oh you have the 13th
Friday in a year obviously not in a
month if I could have a domesticated
dinosaur as a pet what kind would it be
well here's the deal in terms of
personality the store pod seemed like
the way to go in terms of size there's
some very small you know like this fire
in there little bribery dude so you know
how they have people have taken a canary
I like that answer too because are not
even dinosaurs but but I'm gonna say
that you know how people have taken dogs
and they have bred them to be smaller I
would like somebody to breed or
genetically engineer a sauropod in a
reasonable size and that's what I want
maybe a horse sized
sauropod even I'm just gonna let them
sit there are that fire going oh this is
perfect perfect kill everything
Lucy velociraptors would be cool except
with their teeth and their size and
their possible violent personality you
can have one that's really mellow I mean
I guess dogs you know have teeth and
stuff and they don't use them on us most
of the time
what year would you read oh you know
what I'm gonna I'm gonna buy time I'm
gonna run around and buy time so you
guys can get some killing experience you
Rockmond I want your attack to go up
they've not seen a baby to can but but I
believe they could look like dinosaurs I
saw a baby or not a baby bird a small
bird that was pecking it in a cafe we
were at pecking on the ground and when
it when it bent over to peck at the
bread I could see that they've really
got skinny necks under there that
they're all feathers I mean underneath
they are a lot smaller than they look
many birds I've seen parrots and things
that were they had suffered illness ISM
that are bald and they look different
I feel bad calling them ugly but
oh god I love teleporters teleporters in
this game oh it's so fun read
good so fun whatever happened to cheat
training a cocker cockatoo rich phrases
breeding dinosaurs what could go wrong I
wonder what their age of sexual maturity
is I mean if it's only a few years
they've done it with foxes and made them
pretty tame right
maybe I love this do I like manga anime
some of it most of it I'm not familiar
with I have to pick yes or no I'd say
mostly I don't like it because I haven't
seen it most of it yeah Tech rebels of
course they probably do smell like wild
foxes and they also make a whole
freaking lot of noise like real facts
like like wild foxes foxes are noisy
little critters anonymous says love you
rich please leave blah blah blah blah
blah in a window when there's a link for
a YouTube video that they might like you
to watch at some point alright do we
know the lifespan of dinosaurs it's a
good question and both do bones have
anything comparable the tree rings I
know bones are constantly being broken
down as well as built up whereas I don't
know that that's necessarily true about
tree trunks so
steamed pink girl had to shoot a fox
because it was eating your chickens and
ducks well yeah I mean I would too poor
little duckies
psychedelic change some well I know from
carbon dating you can tell how old a
dinosaur was but I think we're I don't
know the carbon dating gives you the
kind of pinpoint accuracy to know how
long a given creature lived I mean I
suppose it's possible that if there were
like two events that really some kind of
radiation signature you know 30 years of
parts and if you found them both at a
bone or something maybe that would mean
it was alive for both of them or
something I don't really know
well then dreamer K if we suppose that a
theropod might have lived for you know
seven or eight decades as its lifespan
not necessarily its life expectancy at
birth then we would also probably expect
that it would reach sexual maturity you
know and at least a decade old which
would mean that it would take a really
long time to breed the ones you want
with selective breeding a really long
time just like it would take a long time
- well something comparable to humans
not that you know yes the ethically
you're allowed to do that with humans
out to drum ship anyway I can't strat
here I think runaway is the strap we're
gonna try taking out their weapons and
see what happens teleporting is not
gonna do me any good in this situation
of course
took out the weapons you'd end up
getting your car destroyed by being
humped by a teenage brontosaurus oh man
yeah they all want to know when Susan's
coming back Susan someone that's Jay
Karen doesn't know any of the memes
yeah I'm clueless she doesn't know any
of the means you're wasting you're
wasting it the largest and
best-preserved t-rex is in the Field
Museum that would be sue I've seen that
it's thought to have lived almost 29
years and and achieved adult size after
20 years but I'm wondering how they know
that how they know how old it was
something with it was similar what they
took the trees aren't they counting like
the Rings I don't know so I'm cutting
something in the bone would like growth
they think it was done over like every
year there's something in the tooth is
what I think there's got to be some kind
of record or something but I'm just
wondering because it's like bones are
constantly remodeled booms are
metabolically active in a way that tree
trunks aren't a turtle is comprar one
size to a dog but can live 10 to 15
times as long true
rich and Jack rail against the whole
board immortal comms concept as a
conversation I'll never forget well
guess what bored immortal oh yeah what's
your point that you'd find stuff to do
uh I don't remember that the
conversation when it's been long enough
but I think we talked about once upon a
time bran flakes says hey rich and Karen
I've been trying to subscribe for months
now but twitch Prime isn't working it
works for me hmm
since it's an Amazon product I highly
recommend I mean you don't have to or
you know it's a free country and we
appreciate your generosity in any
capacity but I'll bet if you send a
message to Amazon they would they would
be happy to help you straighten that out
you're a Prime customer and that's you
know part of what you're paying for is a
Prime customer somebody trying to board
me what do I think of Rich's German text
reading of the last best worse
you were reading something in German oh
yeah just taping back the boxes in
German I haven't heard it
do I not watch the Earlham videos mostly
not
but I have seen pyrite is all right by
me and I think it's adorable and
wonderful the Western or musical ores
pan Taylor says Karen what do you think
of these things you know nothing about
and Asya that's that's our Ella
it's I have nothing against such things
Karen doesn't watch Harlem videos so
rich still has dignity and Karen's eyes
down I've seen to be a Harvard geologist
that was adorable
guys picked the wrong ship to try and
board are they on your ship well they
were they're all dead now that guy looks
like the thing yeah he's a rock man he
probably looks just like the thing I'd
gone rich is forcing me not to watch any
rlm video right I've seen a couple of
things I am NOT a huge fan of bad movies
and some of the stuff with rich being a
blanket are slightly disturbing Shep I
would like an opinion clone babe or do I
stick with my mid name the advantage of
the medbay is that I can obviously
continually heal people which sounds
underwhelming compared to the clone BAE
the clone BAE is if one of your people
dies they just pop up in the club a new
a new version of them the problem with
that is they're not really the same
person there's well they're not really
the same person yes philosophically it's
a nightmare
also though their skills go down a
little bit I have a med bay and I just
play a little bit carefully I can
everyone I can have everyone with mak'st
attack stats max attack stats real
answer med if you're feeling adventurous
clone
all right I'm sick of a med I've never
played around with a clone Bay before
and I guess I guess this isn't the best
time to do that and bran flakes also
said thanks for the content it's helped
me through some tough times LOL raaaaahh
bless stroud and then he says I tipped
four dollars and Karen didn't read my
entire tip oh god which I just corrected
now
the sub didn't work until today love you
guys and don't forget to look up Les
Stroud who les who amid bass seems to be
the the most popular Les Paul just cuz I
accidentally teleported them into space
that would people know about Les Paul
was he was a guitarist and I think he
had him like that fuses arm and like a
bent position so he could play it after
he wasn't some kind of car accident but
just just kind of crazy no only one I
want to take out those weapons as fast
as we can what about the plot hole in
Jurassic Park you're talking about the
t-rex it just went over the thing away
from aerelon have you enjoyed riches
other gigs like too loud or the end is
nigh
mostly I've enjoyed his his first-person
impromptu stand-up silliness in person
and whilst I've been goofy at net person
yeah goofy I know
but I'll business lately Karen all
business well you've been you've been
trying to keep track of all these
different video games you've been
spending a lot of time doing homework
spending time working and stuff and also
we've been trying to enjoy our summer
stuff a little going up to the lake and
oh we went we went up to the lake what
was that two days ago yeah and we put
our bikes on our bike rack and like the
bike rack started to shift and so we're
I'm the home basically it more or less
collapsed that we almost lost our bikes
in the highway yeah so we're we're on
the on the Hoan bridge which is this
really big high bridge that's a way like
the the chata st. Karen this is a this
is hysterical and they don't know this
which lake which which leg okay if
you're in Milwaukee or Chicago would you
say the lake we people just around here
assume that you mean the gigantic
freshwater Inland Sea that is like
Michigan this is one of the largest
bodies of water fresh water are the
planet yeah it's a very big lake and so
Lake Michigan is right so Crystal Lake
no no you would know if you're not you
know you're not from around here but it
is funny yeah of course that's what we
read there are a lot of fucking lakes in
Wisconsin but if you are anywhere near
Chicago or Milwaukee and bullaes there's
no way for one thing yes you're going to
refer to a different like you will say
if you mean anything there's the lake
and then the others have names this is
the lake but yeah Lake Michigan and it's
enormous
oh there's I mean there's Lake Geneva
there's a bunch of lakes but if we meant
to any Lake other than Lake Michigan we
would have said it like Michigan yeah
the lake the fresh lake of Chicago like
The Fresh Prince of bel-air might be
so anyway so we've got our bikes on our
bike rack which we need to get a
different bike rack the problem with our
bike rack is that the bike rack assumes
that all bikes weigh 35 pounds and
riches is more like 50 mine's probably
about 35 but mine's only like a 24-inch
it's it's like a mountain bike II kind
of thing but I guess they just assumed
that everybody's got a ultralight
ten-speed which is not true so when
you're snobby rich in care and you
simply refer to it as the lake yeah
because we're mega snobby uh-huh
so anyway so we're on this bridge that
they used to call it the bridge to
nowhere I guess because they built it
and then it took them awhile to connect
it to they filmed that famous scene and
the Blues Brothers there were the ship
without the ship of the car with the
through Nazi cars fly off the bridge so
we're on this bridge and we're trying to
get the bike rack adjusted and the
trooper pulls up behind us this the
sheriff's deputy because I guess the way
he suggested that I get in the car and I
was making him nervous it sounds like
maybe somebody called I I think I guess
there have been a bunch of suicides on
it but I assured him and was true I was
not there to jump off the bridge we just
wanted to make sure that the bikes
didn't fall off and possibly hurt
somebody and also we like our bikes so
we went up to the lake and where were we
going after this maybe that's what the
point was no point was insulted the cop
over story yeah after the bikes until
they fell off the back of the car on the
bridge and then and then we just kind of
rode around the lake you know they've
got like and we did a little kayaking
too which was nice the kayak rental
place yep
the only mist gotten running out of
missiles around the whole lake there's a
some kind of a I don't know if you what
exactly you do like where where the
straight part straights part of it is or
something but I guess you can take
there's like a highway you can take all
the way around like Michigan but yeah we
weren't gonna bike the whole thing that
would take a while I mean it's like 300
miles long was it probably like 700 or
something to go all the way around it I
don't even know oxygen rich they say I
assume they mean oxygen Richard not Door
County I have been to Door County and I
like Door County I don't know that rich
would like Door County it's it's mostly
shopping and like fish boils and Rich's
allergic and allergic to shopping too
but it's really nice there in the
summertime
they originally shot Friday the 13th at
a real camp in New Jersey to shields in
Sector four look I had to make my
choices in life and it's largely worked
out what's Rich's favorite shop I don't
have a favorite shop I'm sorry
oh sure you have to know that story game
crazy Game Stop mm-hmm there's steam no
the electronic section of wherever Best
Buy yeah
who's reading stuff Karen is who was
Karen Karen is rich this fiancee Amazon
is my favorite shop too because they've
kind of got everything even if they're
the evil empire they do still have
bricks and mortar stores and now Amazon
starting to have some oh good wool is
definitely fun I think rich is kind of
over thrift stores because he's always
chopping them for props so I'm gonna
done that to death in my life this rich
clothes shop of course he doesn't go
around naked reluctantly close shop not
going around naked
people keep sending rich all the shirts
and tomes he could ever need no they
really don't well he does get the
occasional tomes oh oh oh please listen
right now if you want to send him some
more and keep them supplied I don't
think they ever expire breena's good god
says i too am allergic to shopping see
he's shopping with me too though ships
I'm like total ADHD about chopping I'll
be walking along I'll be like oh what's
that and then he'll just keep walking
and then he'll look back like five
seconds later and I'll be forty faces
behind him
what are tomes if you honestly don't
know tomes are chalk tablets that people
use as an ass antacids she doesn't know
any of the rlm memes well I know that's
an AR el-amin but somebody said what are
Tom so just in case they're part of our
international audience and they may not
have that particular brand not not a
single one of them I don't gypsum I
don't think they're gypsum just seems
like talc just say more like just say
gypsum for like no discernable reason if
somebody said aren't they gypsum and I
said they're not gypsum gypsum is like
talc
these are chalk I need to brush up on
the rlm Laura Laura
not really I need a study guide need
like a Cliff's Notes
I really miss an international one they
apparently do their did they there seem
to be some some certainly seem to be
some Germans in here and and and in at
least one Austrian and and I don't know
if you're not from the US tell us where
you're from
Australia Norway Scotland Uganda sweet
Argentina Denmark Serbia Germany's des
Germans Mexico the Netherlands Guatemala
Texas North Korea wonder if these people
are just making these up Syria Wisconsin
Finland Mars Ohio Liars what time is it
in Australia right now sometime tomorrow
but was it like 2:00 in the afternoon
tomorrow or something that's someone
says they're from the Sun there's some
dromeda that's interesting
none of us are really here you're
hallucinating
actually this is all a dream your back
in bed heavily sedated they do that
every time I try to escape I said Texas
is a joke because you asked about other
countries well Texas was another country
do you know what an expensive and
department like that in the Sun cometh
that was worst case scenario
I don't know that much about Texas is
history it sounds like Mexico said hey
you want to come and live down here you
can live under here you can live here
but this is kind of Mexico so you kind
of have to live by your rules and the
Texans said well no we have not fuck
they are gonna do what we want and then
they fought about it and there were more
of them

[D] which seems kind of mean but I don't
know was a while ago remember that one
place yeah I don't think anybody's
forgotten about that one place Texas is
hot but has a lot of trees hope this
helps Texas is not monolithic in terms
of climate like Houston is hot and humid
and disgustingly humid and other West
Texas is hot and disgustingly not humid
like really dry and somewhere in between
there might even be some place where the
humidity is something reasonable I don't
know rest in peace rich they said yeah
the theme-park chains Six Flags Over
Texas the six or the six different
countries including Texas that
originally claimed to let that place
let's see I'm gonna guess the United
States England France Spain Mexico and
the people who were there we whatever
tribe was there first
oh the Confederacy yeah I guess they
probably claimed Texas at some point too
Texas panhandler your wife wants to move
to Alaska I suggest someplace like on
the coast and relatively south because I
watched a video about and think of the
name of right now but the the city way
far in the north of it and it sounds
like a miserable place to live just
where snow was a potentiality every
single month of the year
yeah Barrow I mean it might be an
interesting novelty the whole you know
White Nights
endless daylight summer thing but egg of
paradox no is nice except when you have
to shovel it snow is awful if you don't
think snow is awful you don't live in an
area that actually gets snow it's a pain
in the butt every time all the time hey
Freddie it's fun to sledding when you're
a kid and like skiing and stuff if your
into that whole kind of thing
I've heard Iceland is is really a nice
place to live and it sounds like they
like wreck you Vic is possibly coastal
enough that it's not ridiculously cold
ice leaded with riche come in a while
crusher city says I'm really enjoying
you guys movie commentary tracks it asks
for a buck but then plays them for free
anyway so here's my post consumer
payment and tip for products well
enjoyed thank you thank you very much
Iceland is greening Greenland's ice I
they both have a fair amount of ice I've
flown over Greenland and it's definitely
got quite a bit of snow yeah Iceland's
got lots of volcanoes and lots of deal
geothermal energy and stuff and maybe we
could do something useful with that
Yellowstone Caldera
Plus Iceland has bjerk and that that
automatically is cool yeah I've heard
that Greenland was a marketing scam then
I've also heard that Greenland was a bit
greener during a like a Medieval Warm
Period or something so I know maybe
global warming will make Greenland
greener or maybe it won't cuz it'll
screw up the ocean currents make
Greenland green again hey they loved
York there too
I believe it I'm sure she's a point of
national pride Bjork would thank Karen
for pronouncing her name correctly also
hello hi
during the summer there's virtually no
snorin snow on the northern hemisphere
whoa
less than there is in winter I mean less
than there was unless there was what 50
years ago or during an ice age it was
warmer there-there Viking runes under
the ice yeah there's there's in addition
to the to the ice ages and the
interglacial periods they're like the
Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm
Period there are smaller fluctuations
Volta deserves more love I really love
the song that she had on that Selma
songs that one I've seen it all the one
that she does it so like a duet with
with Tom your Tom York
what time is it where you guys are um if
you're speaking to rich and I at 66 its
655 central Daylight Time here in
Milwaukee
there's like a David Attenborough
documentary with Bjork - which is kind
of strange I feel weird asking this
ascender Oh Tsubaki but what are you
wearing rich Evans clothing he's wearing
like a Batman Superman t-shirt yeah and
jeans and shoes probably but I can't
really see from here I didn't pay too
much attention to what he would aren't
wearing his feet going out fucking drone
ship what am i what am I like 80 percent
drone ships this run Google string time
Wisconsin yeah yeah Wisconsin it was on
the same time zone as Chicago the did
the lower 48 the parts the United States
that don't include Alaska and Hawaii
there are four time zones Pacific is is
like look at what California's on
mountain is like Denver and stuff over
there and out west and then the
Midwestern part of the country is on
central and the East Coast is on eastern
time although the times don't seem to be
a little bit weird shaped like their
parts of Northwest Indiana that are on
Central but the rest of the states on
eastern Arizona has no daylight savings
time there's one doesn't need no
daylight savings time it's not a sack
there now I know it has nothing to do
with the length of the actual day
TV schedules in Pacific and mountain
times suck yeah it's well I guess it's
good if you want to go to bed early we
have some things on 8:00 Eastern it's on
7th central and and then it's on it you
know five o'clock in the afternoon when
nobody's home Western I I can understand
where that's a pain in the neck I don't
think we should abolish daylight savings
I think we should have daylight savings
all year long because it really sucks
when it gets dark at like 4:30 in the
afternoon in the middle of winter rich
have you ever thrown up a movie being so
bad not physically no
yeah I love daylight savings time my bad
movie immune systems pretty good at this
point Russia
I think they've kind of decided to be on
permanent daylight savings time yes I
would I would be fine with that and
they've got like five different time
zones and Australia's got all these
weird half-hour time zones I think
Australia or New Zealand want some
someplace I've got one that's like a
quarter to the our time zone time zones
are weird and China just has one which
means they should have like five or
something obviously it means the sunsets
a vastly different times in different
parts of the country
that's interesting that the Navajo
tribes that Arizona follow daylight
savings time in Russia daylight save you
rich have you ever walked out of a movie
I desperately wanted so badly to walk
out of Attack of the Clones
but I had a friend got me in for free
and they were sitting near me and I
would have been the rudest fucking thing
ever I I spent 75% of that movie in
agony captain Nick pick I think this is
the first time I've talked about China's
single time zone but just for you I'm
doing it again you're welcome
you
which one you are less interested
Stargate or next alien movie the next
alien movie
why do you hate civilization games I
never said I hated civilization games go
fuck yourself
aren't they basically like SimCity with
armies or something kind of any thoughts
on spawn it's awful
heck bot says rich Evans hates
everything especially you for asking if
he hates everything I know hypothesis
that I like act bot
heck bot and I are buddies Ridley
Scott's gonna ride that Alien franchise
down like slim pickins on a nuke it's
possible
what's the weirdest incident you've
witnessed in a theater
I don't think anything weird has ever
happened to me in the theater
have you ever gone sailing
can you talk to them what I'm almost
dead I've never been on a sailboat I've
been on boats that are powered with
motors and boats that are paddled
paddled with oars going to trivia in a
minute what should my name our team name
be thank you
Helms festival team blanket
Haitian balloons the Jurassic Park
arcade no am i interrupting you yes is
this timed
or just all right we're doomed this is
the last and this is the last stand
okay Koster

grim look on his face it was nice
knowing you
is this real tax you can pause it
I've not seen spider-man homecoming yet
the last movie that I saw fucking
amazing
it was Dunkirk I know you don't care
it's fucking amazing I want to see it
eventually

did you see baby driver nope did you see
did you see did you see did you see
we're doing that shit again come on come
on
they say you should jump
I said Dunkirk it was pretty good
I don't know they don't necessarily see
it again I'm sorry that's all right I'm
sorry your carapace has been has been
thrown apart and discarded like the
seagulls cleave crab claws all over the
lawn at the Museum rest in peace krabby
patty f13 baby
rich Evans captain disappoint but
probably right but I'm good at that do
they use the bathroom how often can you
win the game these days rich FTL I'm at
practice right now
know that I haven't won I won once
recently applies don't find this again
like a week ago I would not call that a
rage everyone how's it a rage quit
I played till I was dead I don't think
that like fake VHS tracking issue thing
in there hey grab me a sour patch would
you just like 75 of them in the kitchen
I do remember tracking and rewinding and
and late fees and all kinds of horrible
things about VHS is that I don't miss at
all
well it's it's not a sour patch just one
it's like the that's the strips you see
what we got here oh wait a minute I
never had airheads extremes that sounds
interesting
rainbow berry oh yeah sour patch kids
are a type of candy it's kind of like
gummy bears or something except covered
in like um citric acid crystals or
something
well Japan and ooby sandwich definitely
has some great candy
video stores work or nice the only
problems with video stores were late
fees and lines and then they had this
old toys then they sold candy and they
have those selections of new movies
a Tiberius clerk to just spend half of
your time listening to people explain
why they didn't deserve a light fee what
day Beria's Kirk said he was an
assistant manager at a video store okay
and I asked have you spent half of his
time listening to people talk about
whether they didn't deserve a late fee
it seems like a thankless job
how do I feel about living in Wisconsin
no wait until rich comes back and ask
him to me don't think it's vastly
different from living in northern
Illinois but Milwaukee's a nice size
Chicago is big enough that living out
the suburbs is you don't get to enjoy
the city too much rich how do you feel
about living in Wisconsin do you agree
with me that it's not really much
different than living in northern
Illinois uh you know what I what said
preferred just because of the just
because of the traffic well I'm saying
things are more accessible than living
out and the far suburb is where we were
yeah I saw there's two ask you to lick
your palms to prove that you washed your
hands after you went to the bathroom he
did and then he flipped you off of
course they probably saw that
Gately says speaking of bathrooms I'm
enjoying tonight's stream from the tub
with wine have some money cheers Cheers
are there at least three people in the
chat will have this game and are good at
it and wouldn't even want to team up for
adjacent kill is that a thing I have
this game on Steam of course I don't
have the console rich Evans is not
afraid of his own germs well I mean if
they didn't kill him on the first pass
running the back through again probably
isn't gonna do him in
I'll do it I'll do it if there are three
people everyone they want to know if
they can play it on their Mac Mini I
think so idea and play it on Steam you
probably play with me yeah basically
conviction you have the game but you are
not amazing at it but that's okay I'll
let that slide we would need we need two
other people before I even considered it
them somebody was saying something about
playing in the u.s. playing what in the
US not sure if I can play in the US well
we're in the US and I've heard people I
don't know like why wouldn't it work
from the UK it probably would don't do
it if you just bought the game I've
certainly heard people playing in this
game who had international accents it's
possible that they were physically
located in the US
but I've heard people so somebody heard
somebody the background he had like a
Swedish or an accent that I heard bits
and pieces of they may well have been
playing from I'm gonna lay one round to
warm up here captain molar is down to
play okay you'll play pub gee I hate pub
G is that molar like the tooth or molar
like molarity all right I'll see if I
got free room and my friends list I just
I just need I want volunteers who
volunteers to die and if there's more
than three I'm gonna be I'm gonna be
cruel here I'm taking three of monks you
who are the highest level in the game
want to take three among them who have
the least leg you can't determine that
to get into a game and that day changes
depending on what we do
captain molar my last name was void of
Spanish form or ah all right bag head
Jason I got a bar and ahead of us the
house and the two-seater I'll take the
two-seater why aren't you checking the
barn both the gas and the battery can
spawn in the barn person running away
from the barn how the hell does a
battery spawn yep this is a video game
