oh my god the predictable ambush
Oh
no oh he's a zombie too I was I was
turning around I was waiting for the
zombie to attack the guy crawling out of
the ambulance
that wasn't stupidity the first one was
I wasn't sure I could die in this
section I wanted to see the zombie the
second time I just wanted to see the guy
get it didn't work out there's a little
girl Robert Atkin Downes we just be
probably he's he's in every game he's a
guy plays Travis touchdown you could
have just told them to turn away
Sarah baby
now I'm here the number of confirmed
deaths has passed 200 the governor has
called a state of emergency hundreds
with hundreds of bodies lying in streets
panic spread worldwide after relief
report from the World Health
Organization showed that the latest
vaccination tests have failed I'm gonna
be quiet because I have never played
this before this is all new to me Los
Angeles is now the latest City to be
presidents are required to report to
their designated board lights have
continued for a third consecutive day
and winter rations are at an all-time
low
a group calling themselves the fireflies
have claimed responsibility for both
attacks their public charter calls for
the return of all branches of government
demonstrations broke out following the
execution of six more alleged fireflies
remember when you're lost in the
darkness
look for the light believe in the
fireflies
oh my god 20 years later that's a
long-ass time

you
where were you test Western District hey
we had a drop to make we we had a drop
to make yeah well you wanted to be left
alone remember so I'll take one guess
the old deal went south and the client
made off with our pills is that right
deal went off without a hitch my
fraction cards to last us a couple of
months easy you want explain this I was
on my way back here and I got jumped by
these two assholes all right and yeah

that we're after him he figures he's

would have been neat
come on in come on in come on in pal
buddy Oh mine friend guy person dude

firefights and the these stealthier
aspects gonna be kind of neat

sold him
excuse me I didn't have much of a choice
I know someone you owed us I'd say you
bet on the wrong horse I just need more
time give me a week
you know I might have done that if you
hadn't tried to fucking kill me our guns
I can't just give me a couple days I was
just gonna say just break his fucking
arm already
it's the fireflies oh the fireflies what
okay they're basically all dead
just go in there finish him off we get
the guns who do you say come on
fuck those fireflies let's go get him
that is a stupid idea
murder gun rut is but how I don't know
we explain it to them look let's just go
find a firefly won't have to look very
far
no Queen Firefly why are you here
business you're looking so hot
where's Robert
I needed him alive the guns he gave you
they weren't his to sell I want them
back doesn't work like that test the
hell it doesn't
I paid for those guns you want them back
you're gonna have to earn them how many
cards are we talking about I'm give a
damn about ration cards I need something
smuggled out of the city you do that
I'll give you your guns back Vince off I
don't know you got him we're here the
military's been wiping you guys out
right about that I'll show you the
weapons I gotta move what's gonna be how
am i enjoying the game it's okay I want
to see those guns
got a move
they're here no way around this
yeah don't enjoy controllers to place
shooters but it's not it's not like a
super fast-paced shooter it's it's
manageable I won't be hitting the
broadside of a barn though so why now
we've been planning on leaving the city
but they need a scapegoat they've been
trying to rile us up just like they did
we're trying to defend ourselves
which probably never finished this
cousin so long I've never played this is
my first time I've ever touched this
game wait I missed a shiny thing oh I'm
on the rails now I can't go back
soldiers that's a way out the door under
the bridge ain't a big fan of these guys
we can sneak by them even though I know
that's not your style we'll see how it
goes moving
you need to get to that door
that Dorner okay we're be a guy or a guy
at we're a guy
what we have to go up here the doors
over there just no there's no guys

fixable
I got his help but I can't come with you
well then I'm staying oh we won't get
another shot at this
hey we're smuggling her there's a crew
of fireflies it'll meet you at the
Capitol building
that's not exactly close you're capable
you hand her off come back the weapons
are yours double what Robert sold me
speaking of which where are they back in
our camp
we're not smuggling shit until I see
them you'll follow me you can verify the
weapons I can get patched up but she's
not crossing to that part of town I want
Joel to watch over her how do you know
them I was close with his brother Tommy
said if I was ever in a jam I could rely
on him was that before or after he left
your little militia group he left you
two he was a good man I could just take
her to the North tunnel and wait for me
there
he's just cargo Joel no more talking
you'll be fine
now go him
don't take long and you stay close let's
go
nobody donated enough to make me play
this this is Marie Christmas try to do
something nice for fucking holidays what
do I get for
let me use the force on you ooh what do
you do get out of my way kid get out of
mine get out of my way yeah that's right
you back off you back off heard all the
shooting but what happened
fireflies same things gonna happen
notice if we don't get off this play you
think you could just replace my dog I
mean my daughter was that what you think
is that you think you think he can just
be a surrogate
all right where are we going you know it
looks like the only way angle
yep down here what Don Wilson - I can't
do it today it I just can't it's good it
would take too much out of it took too
much out of me the other night
where are we going
up there that'll get us to the North
tunnel how are we supposed to reach that
just give me a minute I didn't know what
I'm supposed to do with this but I know
it's here so I have to do something with
me over there um we're stairs coming out
stairs
where's the spot I have to climb up to
with us probably there will that reach I
don't know
can you climb that probably not oh and
did the quick turn I figured out the
quick turn
and how you're gonna climb that little
girl I hope you can jump
you can climb up in your own or do I
have to help you up yeah keep going
just take your sweet-ass time yep
sometimes no that's a first
what's the deal with you and Marlene
anyways I don't know she's my friend I
guess your friend you're friends with
the leader of the fire guys what are you
like 12
she knew my mom and she's been looking
after me and I'm 14 not that that has
anything to do with anything
it's where are you parents or anyone's
parents even gone a long long time so
instead of just staying in school you
decide to run up and join the fireflies
daddy look I'm not supposed to tell you
while you're smuggling me if that's what
you're getting at you don't know the
best thing about my job I don't gotta
know why be honest with you I give two
shits when you're up to well great good
well dog boy 13 I'm glad to keep hope
alive is it you can have to deal with me
talking less than experience in-game or
it's just the trade-off I'm sorry what
are you doing giving time well what am I
supposed to do I'm sure you will figure
that out
your watch is broken Shmuel swabs
you mumble in your sleep I hate bad
dreams yeah
you know I've never been this close to
the outside look how dark it is
can't be any worse out there
can it
what on earth - the fireflies one with
you hey sorry it took so long
soldiers fucking everywhere how's
Marlene she'll make it
I saw the merchandise it's a lot do this
yeah how do I feel about this character
do I not like this Curtis characters
okay
this character is my daughter died feel
bad for me that's his that's his
character so far it's a bit strange that
they're having us do their smuggling
he's my daughter died feel sad for me
and learned to love replacement daughter
I now know the entire story how he's
gonna be kind of standoffish but he's
gonna grow attached to this little girl
and this little girl's probably gonna
learn how to be tougher and
self-sufficient by hanging out with a
grizzled dude I already know what's
gonna happen on their road trip together
alone because obviously chick isn't
going to come with them
who's waiting for us at the drug load
you said there's some fireflies I've
traveled all the way from another city
you're almost be important what is the
deal with you you some bigwigs daughter
or something something like that how
long is this all gonna take if
everything goes as planned we should get
you to them in a few hours
le once we get out there I need you to
follow our lead and stay close yeah I'm
not saying that's a bad story but it's
Naaman friendly prick moles really
standard blatant blatant drama it's fine
that's not a deal-breaker it's just it's
just not a revelation it's just well
yeah da that's what they're doing I have
to plan I thought you were gonna climb
up
how long do I plant it's probably not
all night this isn't this isn't gonna be
a Christmas marathon all right we're
good
whoa kid
watch your step it's raining it isn't
good
up this way
I can take photos why would I want to
take photos I'm not gonna look at them
later it's not like this is my vacation
put your hands on your head
put your hands on your head put your
hands on your head put your hands

[D] this is Ramirez at sector 12 the
question pick up a three stragglers
understood look the other way
and to make this worth your while shut
up I thought we were just gonna hold
them up or something shit look
Marleen citizen
why the hell are we smuggling an
infected girl I'm not infected no which
is why I can explain you better explain
fast look at this I don't care how you
got infected it's three weeks old to
know everyone turns within two days so
you stop bullshitting it's three weeks I
swear
why would she set you up
by
where'd you go
when I give you the signal we run
somewhere
le it's gonna be another sprint ready
only I'm not supposed to sprint because
I have to keep ducking
so obviously I have to deal with these
guys
or maybe not be able to go away on their
own follow me all right follow me follow
me to the place
I'm assuming the kid has magic don't get
detected by people powers losing I think
an escort mission with stealth would be
obnoxious I think that I'm gonna I'm
gonna hope they know that
go go
right
nope nope nope
she's got a problem they're not supposed
to shoot you
alright it's fine
No
right
where do I buy my video games at the
store be fair most things I end up
getting these days are from Steam
you know think of the bricks a bad idea
at no point has a lure ever worked out
well for me
okay take a nice gun
I can't take a good gun oh fuck off fuck
off you you person you
great
just died
my hate I'm just gonna choose just okay
it's fine
waiting sticking around to find out it's
- gonna close this yes you got any idea
which way
Hey
see where this leads yeah this looks
right stay close
at least we're out of the rain how the
look I think we can squeeze through
there yes let me use the flashlight so
the people with guns can see this light
I know I know it's probably on it's
probably program so they ignore it but
it just feels wrong I feel weird I'm
gonna stop with a flashlight on
nobody here ignore them ignore the light
are we safe no they're still around
well the moment to get you back Joel see
if there's anything we can use in here
sure thing boss oh no is there crafting
there's crafting ow fuck
how am I supposed to craft
what's wrong with crafting this it's
probably gonna be tedious
yes up there here through this pot I
think we can make it through here okay
don't mind my flashlight don't mind my
emerging breaking flashlight
yes this is the rlm twitch stream which
is really just rich Evans and Jack and
sometimes J what was the plan let's say
that we delivery you new to the
fireflies what then Marlene she said
that they have their own little
quarantine zone with doctors they're
still trying to find a cure
yeah we've heard that before hunt s and
that whatever happened to me is the key
to finding a vaccine oh Jesus that's
what she said oh I'm sure she did hey
fuck you man I didn't ask for this
me neither Tessa what the hell are we
doing here what if it's true
I can't what if Joel and we've come too
far let's just finish it do I need to
remind you what is out there I get it
this way Jade did I say J yes yes J is
here right now he's just not saying
anything he's been silent this whole
stream he's in he's intently watching
the story he's not tied up in gag
because I've went insane and taken
everyone hostage
is it building leaning over I don't
think architecture works that way this
game was made after 9/11 right and we
know we know what happens when there's
some kind of structural failure at a
large building and they don't they don't
they don't comically tip over
are they clipping
I'm not an engineer but I know you're
there
architects probably designed these
buildings so they don't fall over
sideways and destroy half a city and I'm
pretty sure they're designed to implode
that just looks dumb
we need to get around this mess
this is the downtown area was now it's a
giant wasteland
I get around way around here I'm
probably not
you know actually can't fall off which
right is here's though have a hidden
path I'm playing on normal because it's
normal that's me that's the normal
should be the default difficulty and if
you want a bitch because normal is too
easy then it shouldn't be called normal
it should be called easy bitch ass
so you gonna pop up it's been ripped
apart
body's pretty fresh
that might be
I'm grabbing crafting shit but I have no
idea how to craft yet
those are one do our one this aircraft
button No
it's the worst controller I have used
the n64 controller what the fuck is it
doing why does it have the analog stick
in the fucking middle
there is no there is a wait waiting for
backup
so I can make a ship is that all I can
do I can just make a shift those my
options is to make a shiv
and make a shiv so I want to make a shiv
or do I want to make a shiv and many I
think I'll make a shiv with that I made
a ship with duct tape and like nuts and
bolts that's okay that's okay I get it
that's okay but it happened they see
using sound wait but you have to hide
they hereby they fight you by sound you
just have to stand still right and why
don't you have your gas mask on because
you're just probably knocking spores
loose left and right there left and
right
the building feels like it's about to
fall apart
oh really the building that's leaning
over comically and at defiance of all
known physics you think it's getting
ready to fall apart you think you think
you think maybe you think maybe the
leaning tower of belem was gonna fall
apart I just think all this shit I know
what it does because I want it I want
all the shit give me all the shit is
that shit I what's that
now this for the order I'd be able to
pick that picture up wave it around in
my hands and put it back down
fortunately I can't do that here because
that would be stupid
anyways it's something Stewie does but I
don't know if that can only be
attributed to Stewie I think I think the
voice getting hired thing that's just
just just a thing that has become
synonymous with Stewie but I think it
was the thing before Stewie Stewie did
not invent condescending
here got yourself up appreciate it
what's my help like do I need to catch
up
yeah yeah
I was get the hell out here
yeah but I think I think modern I know
about the Leaning Tower of Pisa of
course I know about that but I'm pretty
sure that modern buildings have been
designed to collapse down because they
don't want to kill thousands of people
and the occasion you don't want you
don't want your city like falling like
dominoes
just see if there's a way through
it's clear come on oh all right kid
you're up
come on
what the fuck long big guy
why are my controller make noises
is there a way to quietly put the shit
down like I might just stuck with this
my hand now do I have to make noise to
get rid of this well any combination of
buttons quietly put this away like like
the party here
they're attracted a nice I throw the
noise-making thing and it does not come
running what do i press to drop it
shitting my pants
let's go where
go we're we're I don't care easy give me
a second to what what do you do that
won't that won't bring all of the noise
sensing monsters reading to you this is
crazy
just don't look down
why doesn't that just open the drawer is
the rusted shut I'll buy that that's
fine
you gotta way through what do you
towards the thing
this is a fairly on the rails I don't I
don't know oh my god

[E] nice
okay
these distractions are great they're
great I can't tell you how much how much
I love the distractions they're they're
great
great I said how great that is when I
did that thing and it did nothing
well that one's a clicker so won't see
me so I just have to be quiet with him
- they're fucking serve a bitch
all right well you work for a change
yes you will
yeah so much for stealth
let's just get out of here
we're gonna help
where are we going
now
Tesco I was gonna slide back down
clever that's how I does alai had to
stop yeah it solved it for me I have a
puzzle
and I got
armful all right
how do you put away a weapon you just
don't have to let's get to it
watch your back
why would I put a weapon away because I
don't accidentally want to shoot
somebody in the face I don't want to
accidentally make noise
yeah
wait that one week in from next week
ever
has nobody has nobody in the chat ever
accidentally pulled the trigger or
whatnot in a game is this completely
heard of unheard of a few people think
the other way it's gotta be the way I
came from I remember where I came from
it's not the bedroom
I buy any gaming materials pretty
peripherals I guess peripherals yes I
just just my fancy gaming mouse really
and it's not even really a gaming not
meant to be a gaming prefer Yolo fury or
whatever fucking whatever but I got a
just a number pad that I use in place of
regular keyboard because it's smaller
well then moving around down on half a
keyboard hanging off the desk to use the
number pad which I prefer WASD and you
can bitch about that you want
Joe collect the garbage should they
really be more zombies hanging around
these guys aren't doing well in or out
of the city myself there's someone alive
to meet us at the drop-off it's gonna be
no new item which I suppose I'm gonna
have to use
the finalists out okay Joe will you take
point I'll watch the man and no matter
what you stay right on his heels I'm
Statia she keeps making me take a point
I don't think she wants to get involved
this is slightly less linear and and
boring than the order can't spray alone
then have to ship them got it got it
makes sense that means I need more ships
I don't have more ships how do I switch
to my thing how do I use my bat is that
just in the main weapons list here one
that bad how do I switch to the damn bad
yeah this just automatically go to the
bat when I do melee
don't waste ship is taking out these
things quietly why don't I want to do
that do I not want to kill all the
things here lion-o I got a wooden stick
on my back is that not a weapon
what how do you run right past that
thing and that's sure why that didn't
work everyone's all about the bricks the
bricks suck
right in front of me like that it's
frightening my only option was to ship
all I could do I could just shift this
game worth my yeah whatever the story
elements are right I get it I get it
yeah I tried melee with the bricks it
ate my face I'll try again
I'll try melee with the brick again it's
not working
it sucks as a lure and so far it sucks
as a weapon
oh fuck you need a shiv to kill a
clicker
have you been run are you magic
facing
combination room that's something I want
yeah you think you think the horrible
monsters are scary yes
it's probably a fair statement I can get
behind that
combinations and safe where's my safe
oh these mores suck the lures just
fucking suck so much for luring several
of them together with these amazing
lures with an effective range of 3
inches they'll lure everything within 3
inches of where you throw the lure
I'm struggling at normal because I'm
taking too much time here that's how the
game wants to be played throw them
closer to the bad guy so I can get the
bad guy to slightly move was supposed to
move a lot
officially swearing off lures I grab a
break I might punch somebody in the face
with it's barely all it's fucking good
for
right now was our crowbar
I was in there
soomi there's some sort of crowbar that
I've been wrong before
maybe I just shoot the walk what what
does that do what did that do I'm
feeling this game is in it's a game yeah
it's not super fun still it's dull yeah
survival something-something survival
yep
all right now what yeah what do you say
you don't say anything useful to Mabel
never played Splinter Cell I hit with a
brick look up Oh for fuck's sake
I'm the wetter
rich can't look up if like that why
would I even think to look up we
actually made it
everyone okay yes let's move you guys
are pretty good at this stuff
it's called luck and I've died a couple
times no death rum first time I've even
played the game so I wouldn't attempt
something a first attempt for first time
through a game I mean madness
absolute madness it's where we go and
test right me through this obvious hole
in this building
how do we get through oh here's the door
use a super effective lure my god it
worked
the lure worked the lure worked the lure
worked the lure worked

[F] shooting at me - where's that
what's-her-face hitting me which means
there's more in the area we got to go
here we go big thing I can move
obviously
climb on up
Joe over here
why are you people so pissed off that I
found the fact I find crafting annoying
there's a general rules why is that what
makes that curmudgeon II okay let's find
out some more lien things you have you
how I mean you must have been somewhere
you shouldn't to find an infected in the
zone yeah I'd sneak out I was in this
military boarding school you'd sneak out
you know explore the city I was in the
mall that place is completely off-limits
how the hell did you get in there I had
my ways
anyways Oh fifteen sir more to be found
around here immerse it like make
something more useful she's alright
and no additional scrap okay
let's see what we got
why not do
minecraft is highly unlikely
dawn handheld console I got our D s it's
about eggs
alright Chad why what makes this game
the best thing ever
what is it tell me tell me you're gonna
be upset at me for not loving it why am
I wrong for not loving it
and I didn't even say hey no point that
I used the word hate it's good it's fine
an old museum some of these things are
hundreds of years old the game portions
aren't super duper fun
all right when it wants me to dip the
controller like that why what is going
on what the fuck is that why does it
have me do that every now and then what
is that
Oh Georgia flash Oh
your cluttered that one Shiv
they don't need to kill you so why waste
the time questions where do I have to go
and kill them with the burger that's
right I'm gonna make a noise it's
probably gonna make the rest coming if
there's a way through I'm pretty
probably better off just finding the way
through unless I have to just kill all
the things that's just something I have
to do that's something I just have to do
you do not have to kill of it I wasn't
trying every other section I've been
through so far I've had to kill all the
things theoretically I guess I could
have gotten through that last section
but I'm assuming yanking that ladder
down would have brought them all running
all right board so up it is yeah I
fucking love blood-borne blood-borne is
fucking great
here we go
where's the next brick hey you guys got
it looking for a brick need somebody
with a bottle
let me waiting oh yeah news today I'm

right side follow me oh she's gonna get

to get bitten because she has to be she
has to be removed
so we can focus on girl and guide so we
can focus on daughter dead daughter man
and surrogate daughter he's totally
gonna put a bullet in her brain not the
little girl but the older girl the woman

you have to run them you want us to just
leave you here yes there's no way I will

that
stop we just left her to die stop you
stay close to me just keep pushing
forward
she took out two of my man
you take out the door yes
somebody said once that every plot has
been done it's just a matter of how you
do it story-wise I don't whatever I
don't care I care about playing a game
the game portions are blah
if this were a zombie movie and not a
game would would you love it or would
you think this was fairly generic would
this be a great zombie movie honestly if
they turn this into a film where there's
just be a zombie movie I'll know about
lures what now keep your head down
oh please fuck off really
yeah weird I want to asshole come from
oh sure why not
it will buy you anything
skew me like the body where they won't
see it no no I cannot
we had a good sense for how good their
vision was like will he I don't know I'm
not sure if that guy will see me if I
try to go on that door well he wasn't
wearing armor didn't seem to matter
Oh bullshit fucking bullshit
all right come on thank you
stay down I don't know how many more
there are
yeah I don't know what Jack tweeted no
stream I told him I was gonna try and do
a solo story maybe for not meeting I was
gonna try it a night you both come in
this way
duck

[G] Oh shush
fuck these guys
all right spread out shit
Oh
I presume the resolver revolver has more
stopping power which i think is what I
want oh my god I look for flood minute
yeah you have to cram hey I need this
shit
versatility look like crap him but he's
crafting in a game with a hypocrite
something I have to do
I hate everyone I want you to know that
Chad I hate I hate every every single
one of you all of you
no way to step out regular fun the hell
out of here before T clickers show up
Oh button prompts that don't work no I'm
not gonna do about a video about this
game
white I can tell what's going on why do
I need the flashlight so it can feel odd
when I have my flashlight on and I'm
still thing and people don't notice the
man with the flashlight is that why you
want me aren't all the flashlights all
the fucking time that's what we're doing
there's the flashlight stream I got to
find you a fucking boat learn to fucking
swim that's what we'll figure out
why aren't you going to place alright
you don't want to go there alright
alright
nothing raft like over here no
is that other way around
so it's not like a puzzle we just have
to take this path what is going on now
I guess it's not the solution
what about diving that's a good trick
this one swimming in the direction this
one the direction of things early
look still works
grab the things there was no sound
effective grabbing things why not
hurry up we need her
is our way to swim
why is it so quiet because I am playing
game
God you swim so slow is there a swim
faster button does it go up and down
button but there's not God
just drown all right I can't go there
oh there's our raps tell us long enough
where you at your breath
get on the fucking thing get on the
thing climb climb thing how come I can't
climb the thing but can I climb on the
board how do I get out oh alright do you
think okay we're gonna wave my
flashlight for some reason batteries
okay just gotta wave it around
what's a good name for dark souls2 Dark
Souls 2 is a good name for Dark Souls 2
if I figured out that doing tasks as
part of the game is doing tasks
enjoyable that's the question I know
it's part of game but is his task
in-game enjoyable is the real question
does anything in life bring me joy yeah
it's not like I love blood-borne or or
Helldivers or a ton of other games I
don't like this game so obviously I'm a
humorless mockers others things gonna
play out
I'm gonna hate this game I just got out
of tehse ever tedious we just keep our
histories to ourselves secondly don't TV
assume that exciting condition freely
blandish slowish pace gunplay and lastly
you do what I say when I say it we clear
sure repeated I can play something else
let go
you wanted this you're getting it Merry
Christmas good there's a town few miles
north of here the fella there those me
some favors a good chance he could get
us a car okay
who's get a move on
there we go yeah it'd be faster to go
through here
what nothing it's just I've never seen
anything like this that's all woods
yeah
why don't you just take me back to my
room she was up to the task why'd she
dropped you off on us
she's better
get out me they've said but your friends
changes a survival weren't too high to
begin with
is that doubt I can get either one of us
back into the city one piece trust me I
wish there were some other option
fireflies I mean real fireflies yeah I
see then sorry
lost myself for a second
she was just being a normal little girl
briefly that's fine
that's a fine moment I'm just being an
asshole there I think I was supposed to
click on that game first so I so I don't
miss the phone again you know what I'm
talking about if you're at the being of
the stream I'm gonna click on this gate
I'm gonna find out I can't get in I'm
assuming and I have to use that plank to
do a thing what was that
the button prompt went away there was a
thing I thought I did click on over here
I guess that went away because I skipped
over learning I can't get through this
way I don't know I don't know
yep board over there to get in I got it
I got it I got it it's already done it's
already done yeah I already figured it
out kid
I'm gonna bring up with me maybe can I
do that oh maybe I can grab it from the
top
wrong button
one that I start streaming of roughly
three hours and 20 minutes ago
wait how do i upgrade this where's the
worst thing how to do thing fairly I
can't do that I can't improve the
mainland weapon why did it tell me about
that there we go right somes good to the
place it's gonna be full of the things
the thing is full of where you usually
made them different places have you I
know this is where he lives but no way
ain't never been here personally and
that smoke I think that's him there's no
better be well let's go check it out
then
and I got me things around here
somewhere
there's things everywhere everything's
just things Thing Thing Thing Thing
Thing I'm rigging that come on there's
another way around here down here let's
watch your step it's a good drop heard a
thing
there's a thing
what is that shit oh shit what
now you're in the thing
and I can't upgrade this I can't upgrade
that that's a lie
fucking face they're fucking fit we've
seen dozens of them this is nothing new
kid
I don't want to waste my stick that
sticks only got like a few swings in it
if I could kill instantly with it that'd
be one thing but I can't
are you alright I'm trying to learn how
to whistle you don't know how to whistle
give me a second
yes she's trying to whistle with zombies
outside that to be fair I think maybe
the game expects me to have killed the
zombie which I did not do
wow those clickers they have amazing
hearing that's how they find you with
the hearing so much of that webbing
look if normal difficulty is easy it
should be called easy
oh yeah I guess I wasn't anything super
cool by those clickers alright that was
a waste of everything was a waste of my
life just go down there somewhere yeah
sure go down there somewhere
it's not gonna be an all-night stream I
have never claimed that no that's not
such a good idea
well I can't boost you up how else are
we gonna open it all right just open it
sure thing thank you
so let's say we get a car from this
buddy you could you could technically
donate for an all-night stream but I
wouldn't see it because I'm streaming
for the ps4 and I'm not hearing
donations important would you be donated
fine thank you very much
sorry I haven't been able to read your
name and if you subscribed I'm sorry I
haven't been able to read your neighbour
from here which is why we need the car
mandatory evacuation evacuate so we
think quarantine zone C some place has
got a heads up before the infection
showed up most didn't yeah must be hard
just leaving all your stuff behind like
that
this place is very quaint quaint I don't
know I mean how would you describe it
empty yeah that would be another way

[H] would you play this before no but I had
a friend that knew everything about this
game apparently there's this character
called angel knives who'd she'd punch a
hole through your stomach before keeping
your head off I'm never a big fan of
these things I wish I could play it
which do you believe in ancient aliens
no I do not believe Egyptians built the
pyramids
well you start playing music what
what is all this music that's just
sitting here no one's around to listen
to it I don't know how's the zoomerang
was this the hipster music star vinyl I
guess it's the only kind of music store
that I can exist these days
because I don't think was supposed to be
the zombie apocalypse of 1975
no weird menu to go through
that's Bill's handiwork anybody else in
this town
as I know with just him
five 1721 I guess it's gonna be a
different safe I probably didn't read a
note one of those safes from before yeah
that one safe from the fourth that's
been enlightening what's the deal with
this guy well you helped us smuggle
stuff into the cities he knows how to
find things well let's hope we don't
blow up trying to find him
just watch your step you'll be fine I
missed the bow and arrow sir bow and
arrow I can pick up sounds fun
see that wire stay underneath it okay
keep your head low you'll be fine
do so Bob built this all on his own
with zombies everywhere how'd he do that
how'd he do that I want to know how do
you do thing all right

looking for alright alright yes we have
to go this way
what happened the duck kid it's good
thing your magic wrench do you think
aliens kick-started evolution why would
I think that ladder on the floor by the
fuckin ladders

where's the plank that's always plank
all right playing counts go find the
plank oh wait I gotta grab this plane
probably that makes sense
here use this
climb this thing climb the thing now
grab the plank this is this is some
intense plank action we have going on
right here intense looks it looks like
old moldy piece of crap though yeah
that's not gonna support this bands
weight all right I get off the thing so
I get this I was gonna try a stranger
over there damn it
me too quick for me get away get away I
got I'm sure I have to use this plank
again no I can't even pick it up the
game the game knows I'm supposed to be
done with it is that what's going on I
don't know shit can you reuse I mean you
were
that state no joy no joy
can you stop wobbling
I have realism love the realism yeah oh
no and it's it's one use shit
of course it's when you don't arrow
sucks he's wobbly and the head is wobbly
and I have to use a controller to do
this I hate this
now listen bill ain't exactly the most
stable of individuals so when we get
there you let me do the talking
you understand you got to be clear on
this you you don't take too kindly to
strangers all right it was a good guy
you just definitely need some time
warming up to you I don't I don't into
shooting in general with a controller
I'm far far more comfortable with a
mouse and ik trailers we're gonna make
it all wobbly oh fuck you
you hear that yeah look at that
you're immune to ever think you want to
run through their little girl I'm still
not sure why is this game so much gooder
than other game I'm not I'm not sure why
you think that fine don't worry I got
this can i disarm that truck gonna try
what's so great about the story it's
this alright I tried to get close enough
to it because you told me I could disarm
that trap I tried to get close enough to
dissuade for a dismantle icon to pop up
or something and it didn't happen I'm
blaming that why on the chat for saying
I could disarm that and that was just
dumb that was just dumb cuz I was
looking at the chat while walking
forward yeah I don't know waste that
health
go in there I want to see what we can
play you're gonna find my body when I
die from a heart attack don't worry I
got this

flashlight on at all times geez think

phrase it looks like that's a
counterweight okay and you think the
fridge isn't booby-trapped let that rope

what's the gameplay focus of this
hello I can't manually reload
squared button every other time I had to
reload it was our tool not aiming
