deaths has passed 200 the governor has
called a state of emergency hundreds
with hundreds of bodies lying in streets
panic spread worldwide after relief
report from the World Health
Organization showed that the latest
vaccination tests have failed I'm gonna
be quiet because I have never played
this before this is all new to me Los
Angeles is now the latest City to be
presidents are required to report to
their designated board lights have
continued for a third consecutive day
and winter rations are at an all-time
low
a group calling themselves the fireflies
have claimed responsibility for both
attacks their public charter calls for
the return of all branches of government
demonstrations broke out following the
execution of six more alleged fireflies
remember when you're lost in the
darkness
look for the light believe in the
fireflies

long-ass time

the old deal went south and the client
made off with our pills is that right
deal went off without a hitch my
fraction cards to last us a couple of
months easy you want explain this I was
on my way back here and I got jumped by
