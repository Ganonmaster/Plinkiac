oh my god the predictable ambush
Oh
no oh he's a zombie too I was I was
turning around I was waiting for the
zombie to attack the guy crawling out of
the ambulance
that wasn't stupidity the first one was
I wasn't sure I could die in this
section I wanted to see the zombie the
second time I just wanted to see the guy
get it didn't work out there's a little
girl Robert Atkin Downes we just be
probably he's he's in every game he's a
guy plays Travis touchdown you could
have just told them to turn away
Sarah baby
now I'm here the number of confirmed
deaths has passed 200 the governor has
called a state of emergency hundreds
with hundreds of bodies lying in streets
panic spread worldwide after relief
report from the World Health
Organization showed that the latest
vaccination tests have failed I'm gonna
be quiet because I have never played
this before this is all new to me Los
Angeles is now the latest City to be
presidents are required to report to
their designated board lights have
continued for a third consecutive day
and winter rations are at an all-time
low
a group calling themselves the fireflies
have claimed responsibility for both
attacks their public charter calls for
the return of all branches of government
demonstrations broke out following the
execution of six more alleged fireflies
remember when you're lost in the
darkness
look for the light believe in the
fireflies
oh my god 20 years later that's a
long-ass time

you
where were you test Western District hey
we had a drop to make we we had a drop
to make yeah well you wanted to be left
alone remember so I'll take one guess
the old deal went south and the client
made off with our pills is that right
deal went off without a hitch my
fraction cards to last us a couple of
months easy you want explain this I was
on my way back here and I got jumped by
these two assholes all right and yeah

that we're after him he figures he's

would have been neat
come on in come on in come on in pal
buddy Oh mine friend guy person dude

firefights and the these stealthier
aspects gonna be kind of neat

sold him
excuse me I didn't have much of a choice
I know someone you owed us I'd say you
bet on the wrong horse I just need more
time give me a week
you know I might have done that if you
hadn't tried to fucking kill me our guns
I can't just give me a couple days I was
just gonna say just break his fucking
arm already
it's the fireflies oh the fireflies what
okay they're basically all dead
just go in there finish him off we get
the guns who do you say come on
fuck those fireflies let's go get him
that is a stupid idea
murder gun rut is but how I don't know
we explain it to them look let's just go
find a firefly won't have to look very
far
no Queen Firefly why are you here
business you're looking so hot
where's Robert
I needed him alive the guns he gave you
they weren't his to sell I want them
back doesn't work like that test the
hell it doesn't
I paid for those guns you want them back
you're gonna have to earn them how many
cards are we talking about I'm give a
damn about ration cards I need something
smuggled out of the city you do that
I'll give you your guns back Vince off I
don't know you got him we're here the
military's been wiping you guys out
right about that I'll show you the
weapons I gotta move what's gonna be how
am i enjoying the game it's okay I want
to see those guns
got a move
they're here no way around this
yeah don't enjoy controllers to place
shooters but it's not it's not like a
super fast-paced shooter it's it's
manageable I won't be hitting the
broadside of a barn though so why now
we've been planning on leaving the city
but they need a scapegoat they've been
trying to rile us up just like they did
we're trying to defend ourselves
which probably never finished this
cousin so long I've never played this is
my first time I've ever touched this
game wait I missed a shiny thing oh I'm
on the rails now I can't go back
soldiers that's a way out the door under
the bridge ain't a big fan of these guys
we can sneak by them even though I know
that's not your style we'll see how it
goes moving
you need to get to that door
that Dorner okay we're be a guy or a guy
at we're a guy
what we have to go up here the doors
over there just no there's no guys

fixable
I got his help but I can't come with you
well then I'm staying oh we won't get
another shot at this
hey we're smuggling her there's a crew
of fireflies it'll meet you at the
Capitol building
that's not exactly close you're capable
you hand her off come back the weapons
are yours double what Robert sold me
speaking of which where are they back in
our camp
we're not smuggling shit until I see
them you'll follow me you can verify the
weapons I can get patched up but she's
not crossing to that part of town I want
Joel to watch over her how do you know
them I was close with his brother Tommy
said if I was ever in a jam I could rely
on him was that before or after he left
your little militia group he left you
two he was a good man I could just take
her to the North tunnel and wait for me
there
he's just cargo Joel no more talking
you'll be fine
now go him
don't take long and you stay close let's
go
nobody donated enough to make me play
this this is Marie Christmas try to do
something nice for fucking holidays what
do I get for
let me use the force on you ooh what do
you do get out of my way kid get out of
mine get out of my way yeah that's right
you back off you back off heard all the
shooting but what happened
fireflies same things gonna happen
notice if we don't get off this play you
think you could just replace my dog I
mean my daughter was that what you think
is that you think you think he can just
be a surrogate
all right where are we going you know it
looks like the only way angle
yep down here what Don Wilson - I can't
do it today it I just can't it's good it
would take too much out of it took too
much out of me the other night
where are we going
up there that'll get us to the North
tunnel how are we supposed to reach that
just give me a minute I didn't know what
I'm supposed to do with this but I know
it's here so I have to do something with
me over there um we're stairs coming out
stairs
where's the spot I have to climb up to
with us probably there will that reach I
don't know
can you climb that probably not oh and
did the quick turn I figured out the
quick turn
and how you're gonna climb that little
girl I hope you can jump
you can climb up in your own or do I
have to help you up yeah keep going
just take your sweet-ass time yep
sometimes no that's a first
what's the deal with you and Marlene
anyways I don't know she's my friend I
guess your friend you're friends with
the leader of the fire guys what are you
like 12
she knew my mom and she's been looking
after me and I'm 14 not that that has
anything to do with anything
it's where are you parents or anyone's
parents even gone a long long time so
instead of just staying in school you
decide to run up and join the fireflies
daddy look I'm not supposed to tell you
while you're smuggling me if that's what
you're getting at you don't know the
best thing about my job I don't gotta
know why be honest with you I give two
shits when you're up to well great good
well dog boy 13 I'm glad to keep hope
alive is it you can have to deal with me
talking less than experience in-game or
it's just the trade-off I'm sorry what
are you doing giving time well what am I
supposed to do I'm sure you will figure
that out
your watch is broken Shmuel swabs
you mumble in your sleep I hate bad
dreams yeah
you know I've never been this close to
the outside look how dark it is
can't be any worse out there
can it
what on earth - the fireflies one with
you hey sorry it took so long
soldiers fucking everywhere how's
Marlene she'll make it
I saw the merchandise it's a lot do this
yeah how do I feel about this character
do I not like this Curtis characters
okay
this character is my daughter died feel
bad for me that's his that's his
character so far it's a bit strange that
they're having us do their smuggling
he's my daughter died feel sad for me
and learned to love replacement daughter
I now know the entire story how he's
gonna be kind of standoffish but he's
gonna grow attached to this little girl
and this little girl's probably gonna
learn how to be tougher and
self-sufficient by hanging out with a
grizzled dude I already know what's
gonna happen on their road trip together
alone because obviously chick isn't
going to come with them
who's waiting for us at the drug load
you said there's some fireflies I've
traveled all the way from another city
you're almost be important what is the
deal with you you some bigwigs daughter
or something something like that how
long is this all gonna take if
everything goes as planned we should get
you to them in a few hours
le once we get out there I need you to
follow our lead and stay close yeah I'm
not saying that's a bad story but it's
Naaman friendly prick moles really
standard blatant blatant drama it's fine
that's not a deal-breaker it's just it's
just not a revelation it's just well
yeah da that's what they're doing I have
to plan I thought you were gonna climb
up
how long do I plant it's probably not
all night this isn't this isn't gonna be
a Christmas marathon all right we're
good
whoa kid
watch your step it's raining it isn't
good
up this way
I can take photos why would I want to
take photos I'm not gonna look at them
later it's not like this is my vacation
put your hands on your head
put your hands on your head put your
hands on your head put your hands

[D] this is Ramirez at sector 12 the
question pick up a three stragglers
understood look the other way
and to make this worth your while shut
up I thought we were just gonna hold
them up or something shit look
Marleen citizen
why the hell are we smuggling an
infected girl I'm not infected no which
is why I can explain you better explain
fast look at this I don't care how you
got infected it's three weeks old to
know everyone turns within two days so
you stop bullshitting it's three weeks I
swear
why would she set you up
by
where'd you go
when I give you the signal we run
somewhere
le it's gonna be another sprint ready
only I'm not supposed to sprint because
I have to keep ducking
so obviously I have to deal with these
guys
or maybe not be able to go away on their
own follow me all right follow me follow
me to the place
I'm assuming the kid has magic don't get
detected by people powers losing I think
an escort mission with stealth would be
obnoxious I think that I'm gonna I'm
gonna hope they know that
go go
right
nope nope nope
she's got a problem they're not supposed
to shoot you
alright it's fine
No
right
where do I buy my video games at the
store be fair most things I end up
getting these days are from Steam
you know think of the bricks a bad idea
at no point has a lure ever worked out
well for me
okay take a nice gun
I can't take a good gun oh fuck off fuck
off you you person you
great
just died
my hate I'm just gonna choose just okay
it's fine
waiting sticking around to find out it's
- gonna close this yes you got any idea
which way
Hey
see where this leads yeah this looks
right stay close
at least we're out of the rain how the
look I think we can squeeze through
there yes let me use the flashlight so
the people with guns can see this light
I know I know it's probably on it's
probably program so they ignore it but
it just feels wrong I feel weird I'm
gonna stop with a flashlight on
nobody here ignore them ignore the light
are we safe no they're still around
well the moment to get you back Joel see
if there's anything we can use in here
sure thing boss oh no is there crafting
there's crafting ow fuck
how am I supposed to craft
what's wrong with crafting this it's
probably gonna be tedious
yes up there here through this pot I
think we can make it through here okay
don't mind my flashlight don't mind my
emerging breaking flashlight
yes this is the rlm twitch stream which
is really just rich Evans and Jack and
sometimes J what was the plan let's say
that we delivery you new to the
fireflies what then Marlene she said
that they have their own little
quarantine zone with doctors they're
still trying to find a cure
yeah we've heard that before hunt s and
that whatever happened to me is the key
to finding a vaccine oh Jesus that's
what she said oh I'm sure she did hey
fuck you man I didn't ask for this
me neither Tessa what the hell are we
doing here what if it's true
I can't what if Joel and we've come too
far let's just finish it do I need to
remind you what is out there I get it
this way Jade did I say J yes yes J is
here right now he's just not saying
anything he's been silent this whole
stream he's in he's intently watching
the story he's not tied up in gag
because I've went insane and taken
everyone hostage
is it building leaning over I don't
think architecture works that way this
game was made after 9/11 right and we
know we know what happens when there's
some kind of structural failure at a
large building and they don't they don't
they don't comically tip over
are they clipping
I'm not an engineer but I know you're
there
architects probably designed these
buildings so they don't fall over
sideways and destroy half a city and I'm
pretty sure they're designed to implode
that just looks dumb
we need to get around this mess
this is the downtown area was now it's a
giant wasteland
I get around way around here I'm
probably not
you know actually can't fall off which
right is here's though have a hidden
path I'm playing on normal because it's
normal that's me that's the normal
should be the default difficulty and if
you want a bitch because normal is too
easy then it shouldn't be called normal
it should be called easy bitch ass
so you gonna pop up it's been ripped
apart
body's pretty fresh
that might be
I'm grabbing crafting shit but I have no
idea how to craft yet
those are one do our one this aircraft
button No
it's the worst controller I have used
the n64 controller what the fuck is it
doing why does it have the analog stick
in the fucking middle
there is no there is a wait waiting for
backup
so I can make a ship is that all I can
do I can just make a shift those my
options is to make a shiv
and make a shiv so I want to make a shiv
or do I want to make a shiv and many I
think I'll make a shiv with that I made
a ship with duct tape and like nuts and
bolts that's okay that's okay I get it
that's okay but it happened they see
using sound wait but you have to hide
they hereby they fight you by sound you
just have to stand still right and why
don't you have your gas mask on because
you're just probably knocking spores
loose left and right there left and
right
the building feels like it's about to
fall apart
oh really the building that's leaning
over comically and at defiance of all
known physics you think it's getting
ready to fall apart you think you think
you think maybe you think maybe the
leaning tower of belem was gonna fall
apart I just think all this shit I know
what it does because I want it I want
all the shit give me all the shit is
that shit I what's that
now this for the order I'd be able to
pick that picture up wave it around in
my hands and put it back down
fortunately I can't do that here because
that would be stupid
anyways it's something Stewie does but I
don't know if that can only be
attributed to Stewie I think I think the
voice getting hired thing that's just
just just a thing that has become
synonymous with Stewie but I think it
was the thing before Stewie Stewie did
not invent condescending
here got yourself up appreciate it
what's my help like do I need to catch
up
yeah yeah
I was get the hell out here
yeah but I think I think modern I know
about the Leaning Tower of Pisa of
course I know about that but I'm pretty
sure that modern buildings have been
designed to collapse down because they
don't want to kill thousands of people
and the occasion you don't want you
don't want your city like falling like
dominoes
just see if there's a way through
it's clear come on oh all right kid
you're up
come on
what the fuck long big guy
why are my controller make noises
is there a way to quietly put the shit
down like I might just stuck with this
my hand now do I have to make noise to
get rid of this well any combination of
buttons quietly put this away like like
the party here
they're attracted a nice I throw the
noise-making thing and it does not come
running what do i press to drop it
shitting my pants
let's go where
go we're we're I don't care easy give me
a second to what what do you do that
won't that won't bring all of the noise
sensing monsters reading to you this is
crazy
just don't look down
why doesn't that just open the drawer is
the rusted shut I'll buy that that's
fine
you gotta way through what do you
towards the thing
this is a fairly on the rails I don't I
don't know oh my god
