book movie

really should I've read the book the
movies very boring but kind of good just
very boring alright so what do we got to

science okay we got the science now
worked it or two to the left left I read
there it is I was good right the shuttle
already oh there's a science up here
I was just deployed defensive assets
great those are my favorite types of
assets Oh turret be prepared to hit the
deck
fucking murder everything
are you coming from over here
down
got him
oh shit sorry I love friendly fire it's
easy to hit other people with a machine
gun
now Richard don't don't get killed by
the shuttle this time you can do it
no I think it should be a running joke
is he just killed by the Challenger
don't do it don't do it it would be
funny but don't do it you know what I'd
rather shoot things with my machine gun
Jack I'm lagging this game this game is
fun yeah great great yes first hour
basically yeah that was our that was
like our third mission was that what all
right cool
having a plan we have not we have not
yet had a plan that might be a good
strategy yeah just press a if you're
streaming live had previously regarded
underscore live yeah it's very true
fights with fish we are streaming we've
been doing pretty good here in the pry
corn region so let's keep that up those
are some more difficult we can do yeah
let's see why I want to shoot a bunch of
things I sure had a few things we're
gonna meet you go for medium glue a
medium okay let's do a medium go for
medium and then that works out we'll go
for challenging great I like it mission
one here we go is there I hope
everyone's okay with medium
Oh actually we're in the same room we're
doing local yeah we're doing local co-op
streaming who's not in those fights with
fish you coming oh sure on the same
screen yeah a local co-op really nice
alright so yeah it's really great so I
think I'm gonna start here and then so
I'm gonna start at the artillery then we
can work our way up to this this this
extraction that and sure great I was
told we needed to make a plan and so I'm
making a plan
I feel pretty good about that plane it's
tickling funny okay what is happening
now we're just waiting
so Nova what are your thoughts on the
Batman vs Superman trailer you seen that
I'm expecting it to be awful everyone
says that doomsday looks like
Michelangelo from the Michael Bay
Turtles movie that's exactly what it
looks like okay we got one deployed
Jesus this is definitely harder that's
great
this is good I can I can deal with this
great was that me did I shoot somebody
else did I do that again
oh yeah you killed me I'm sorry jack I'm
bout to get mine great make us come back
now Oh everyone else dead
yes everyone else is dead oh no okay Oh
No get us back I'm trying I'm trying I'm
trying
alright alright hold on run away oh I'm
in the Sun I can't run shoot that thing
alright alright oh shit oh shit oh my
first my first night with the game fair
that's fair then I can utterly fuck
alright get everybody killed and then
failed to revive everyone I think I'm
allowed to do that on my first day with
the game what a calm man Nova is we like
him more people were like Nova I would I
would multiplayer more often I think so
ok let's try that again
red
all right we're gonna go with the same
plan here start down here work our way
okay okay but we're gonna fuck up less
we're gonna work on not dying that
sounds good that sounds good oh they did
it didn't you wave your finger up yeah
that's our that's our tip notification I
don't know if you can hear that yeah
that's a little while all right I am I
am activating a deployment no it's a
wait so it comes up and activate the
second phase of the deployment as well
really yeah
all right I got north
and I'll take South okay
now let's head up straight north
hard to run in this note you got a press
on you got a press through I think I
think I found a way to run through the
snow
yeah just gonna keep it up cover and out
I think might be might be slut now no
okay keep moving keep moving keep moving
okay
here there aria we're aria Oh
I think I really like this game yeah
yeah great great all right
ah Oh dead do rich do it nice

okay up up into the right let's let's
clear this area first because we're
about to get help me out help me out out
nope
there you go oh we we we crushed
fights with fish dammit I can't use it
someone else needs to get fights with
fish back
I think it's oh I can't oh no one can
okay no one get crushed by him this time
I capture this area here we got this we
got this
we got it now to the left down slightly
into the left okay this shotgun is great
oh that's why I'm getting slowed down
occasionally this this rage sticks
getting stuck whoa
all right still still down and slightly
to the left come on rich what
come on guys rich yeah oh who shot me
who shot me god dammit I don't know I
got you oh here it is over here's the
capture point alright alright
I'll reduce the capture point
is a game that's kind of hard to talk
over it's not happening yeah that's okay
maybe it's exciting to watch I don't
know people aren't leaving haha
is that an animal drop Patrick I'm kind
of oh okay I use a clip or two before I
grab that
yeah
that's very
okay up and up into the right is the
extraction zone all right
I feel like I'm doing much better now
that's how I feel you know I'm gonna do
the same thing
look at that shit look at that she took
everyone out then that South portion
that was awesome how come nobody's
talking about the awesome things I'm
doing huh I'm not paying attention
hit the deck hit the deck
I gotcha
or doing good guys these turrets are
little nuts hope there's a laser man
fuck it just blind with you yeah I like
it I like that strategy
no one gets smushed by the shuttle
all right let's go oh no oh oh go help
him go ahead it's too late oh yeah I
thought he was he was dead I thought he
was dead I thought he was dead
I'm so sorry Nova I'm a jerk I thought
you were dead
I cover I could have revived you though
I could have revived you I thought it
wasn't too late
rich you left him to die I couldn't get
out of the shuttle every man left the
light it's for democracy Nova you did
you died for democracy that's great
let's do that again you undo it straight
let's hear the next level up it's Ryan
unless one is there another section in
the media mirrors it I don't know is
there a mission two or three yeah yeah
yeah there's missing two and three
they're chat saying rich you were an
embarrassment to the Marine Corps you
are yeah yeah rich gets the medal of
cowardice alright let's let's select our
mission Jack okay
retaliatory strike two
let's go all right lemonade oh oh look
at this this is just kill everyone that
sounds fun
great let's do it let's kill everyone
I had I hit the confirm button in time I
did it I did it I'm a big boy yeah
okay we can do this
yeah you know what I got it
you got
Oh fucker
it was my own turret that got me oh not
again
no no I you know what I died trying to
save him this time yeah yep yep I'll get
you back I paid for my earlier cowardice
with my life oh I got hit by the turret
the second I get out of the pond get its
back ribs let's clear out some of the
chapter right wherever we go all right
okay they're not to turrets sure why not
do we want to
I would say I want to boil your throw
down at earthen because I am a madman
and I'm dropping ammo which I need one
shit no good no no no no no no shit get
up again come on
all right somebody revive me on it
Oh for fuck's sake I I'm dead already
I got lasered Jesus Christ that turret
our turret sucks our turn just sucks
yeah mine too it's alright just survive
just survive oh oh just stay close to
that turret rich is a burden and a
coward you know kind of catch is kind of
okay
to stay alive no no no rich bullet
sponge Evans hey I kept dropping down in
front of them turret okay
we came close how's it going ahead this
is does engage do it again let's do it
again we got it we got it all right back
in I'm not as tough when I'm not killing
babies in dead space
all right here we go we got this we can
do this and I believe in us I believe in
democracy
what are you throwing down machine gun
rock I'm not I'm not fucking around with
turrets I'm not I'm not doing that right
die motherfucker die
you know what what some anticipation mo
it's probably good idea
again thank you no problem no problem
sweet Jesus
which I jack
oh my my bullets thank you
yeah
I'm just gonna hang close to this turret
and so I can try to follow its movement
that's my plan
it's my turret strategy I know how to
stay out of the range of our own guns
that's important
hahaha the guy up huh wait wait wait
Oh No yeah that did your wives so run
along that's a lot
oh man our turrets doing more damage to
us than the enemies I think they're
helping sure don't try without let's try
I think we're doing better I think we're
getting killed Barone turret sure
president look we'll see I look over at
the chat don't guess I'm considerate no
all right let's try again no turrets
fight so efficient he's doing something
he's probably yelling oh no he left he's
probably gonna yell that by his wife yes
let's be honest he's just left you can't
talk to people microphone you're so d
years old oh so if you're not using your
turret you can change your turret to
something else oh yes I'm fine for now
yeah you know the air strikes are pretty
localized so I'm hoping they'll they'll
do less damage to us okay
smart idea
oh fuck did you get killed by arms you
killed my own Supply Drop I'm on it
great start great start great start Oh
God and we're getting overwhelmed
because I'm dead oh I've ruined
everything again pretty much this is my
life
great that's a good plan all right I'm
calling in a mo a head of time I gotta
reload
die motherfucker die you so crazy
I'm covering I'm covering all my time
okay okay gotta grab that em off I'm
reloading I can't do anything okay okay
I gotta reload this machine
ah that was quick huh I got him
through the area first oh I don't got
almost I thought we're doing pretty good
there
oh wait wait well oh my god yes
ah forget it just run Jack run run I'm
run
you got this Jack give it no no you
don't you don't get anything oh my god
how we feel about this you want to give
this one we're trying all right all
right one more Drive no that was me
what what what should we adjust
strategy-wise what's the deal what's dil
I I think we need to accept turrets into
our lives okay but when someone drops
the turret everyone just kind of stayed
close to it so we can keep an eye on it
ir our problem is we're not paying
attention to each other's turrets okay
okay oh that's me sorry I need avenues
you press a that's my official stratagem
asking if I'd buy this on Steam and have
two controllers can my buddy and me both
play on my PC that's what we're doing
right now
Chet's you can do that yeah it's great
rich can't level up because what on my
account button I think I can use the
things you've loved them though yeah I
think I just mirror whatever you are I
all on I'm getting my turret back here
but yeah this is local and online co-op
and we happen to be playing both local
and online co-op right now which is
great well if you can if you can find us
on Steam and join in go ahead I don't
know how that works obviously other
people oh oh hey all right we're all
having new experiences today well there
you go
yeah so keep an eye on this turret
rich-rich
yeah yeah yeah yeah I got move away to
the turret then I got lasered by some
dude yeah
oh rich did you die yeah okay
just don't stand under me jack oh god
there's robots spawning on top of me oh
good you might kill him like that so
we're gonna come straight up here yeah
sounds fine that sounds fines down there
okay
Maxon helping hands Oh Jack thanks the
helping hand what happened I was on the
ground oh sorry we're not killing us
right not killing it
sweet
yes yes I'm not doing well yeah yeah
right
I got a turd coming in so
no I got it I got I got it the
reinforcements thing I got it out here
you guys come it was fast enough okay
rich it's all up to you yeah yeah I can
see that don't forget about your
grenades
oh-ho God forget it forget it
oh you can reload while sprinting that's
good media Wow
medias right again it would be
incredibly disappointing if if we didn't
end up beating this Nova the Chet the
chap thinks you're a baller which i
think is a good thing I'm not up on my
hip hop the chant thinks that you're
very good at this game at least as
compared to rich and I so it's been
compared death let's do this I think the
world needs more twin-stick shooters
they're my favorite
what you doing on yeah Michigan maybe
yeah I'll drop one fuck it
I got a resupply coming up
shit what happened I was looking at
enemies of a shooting and out of the guy
who was shooting the laser at me I got
you I'm dying a lot I don't know if I'm
cut out for this this mission jack you
can do it right I've done well before
yeah
I've stopped doing well since once again
we're gonna come straight up here while
the turret takes care of all them down
there oh I just did too
it's the more the merrier oh yeah
oh that's fine it's fine everything's
fine
come on okay I got it I got it are you
calling in yeah
reinforcements called
if they're ready to get there get there
get there nice Wow alright
reinforcements aren't cool down okay I'm
coming I'm coming due it's probably wise
we're about to find out
oh good good placement good placement
well I'm gonna drop a turret
yeah Jack if you can do reinforcements
I got blocked off but can you send
reinforcements okay come in they're
coming yeah they're coming

Oh rich killed us all rich I want to say
that was our best run yet though what so
what happened what happened rich what
happened was I hit down where I should
have hit all right all right
is that okay oh not really not no it's
not I had a chance I had a chance to
save everybody Richard just got to work
on his fast drop I'm not a quick time
event guy and I never did like your
ddr's or your oh sure sure he's used the
right firm track oh yeah I'm sorry
Ritchie zigs when you should have zagged
yeah yeah these two clowns are holding
Nova back yeah it's true
we are holding you back now but it's
also it's a fun game to play
alright alright I'll drop the turret
right away
dropping ammo
did I shoot my way dropping turrets I
thought I dropped one already I think I
broke it
I'm dropping another one I think I broke
my own turret
whoa
I had dubbed history right here jacket
low enamel huh your low enamel no I'm
not here to waste bullets rich when a
huge swarm comes and you only shoot one
bullet don't blame me
don't blame me huh huh huh right so many
things you have to keep track of kind of
great Oh fucking turret got me along I
was running away from it I was saying
why thank you
long time
the turret is our friend
the turret is our friend rich yes I
understand that
what is it Oh bet you thought I had you
thought I had you oh that all of us did
that is all of us then it went really
bad really quick what happened I don't
even know what happened I'm interested
in buying this game is any good I'm
enjoying it I'm enjoying this a lot I
would say yeah agreed
obviously we're just a couple hours in
alright we got we got more people we'll
wait to send out that SOS earlier should
we try to get a fourth person oh is that
how do we do that I think that's how I
did it because we accidentally sent out
the SOS and then suddenly two people
joined oh okay let's do that then what
hmm you switch weapons I can upgrade
upgrade stuff okay okay
okay I'll send out an SOS first thing
okay you do that we'll see and we'll see
if we can get a fourth a fourth person
in okay okay and it might just make it a
bigger clusterfuck you know what that's
okay I think we've been okay with the
clusterfuck we get somebody else whose
wife is yelling at them
that's how did it go that's what we need
we need we need we need more domestic
violence on our show
all right now so as I'm sitting on some
ammo
all right I have a turret down turn it
down yeah
which I'll Jack you've written right in
front of my goddamn machine gun I got
you nobody Oh God Wow Wow
shit shit
all right I'm down if someone can get to
me come on all right I'm okay
shit I'm out of amyl worst possible time
I'm reloading

calling for reinforcements do it
dammit oh damn it fuck it are you doing
it well I'm fucking up doing it again
okay I got it right I got it right okay
good
well three guys dropped on me and I'm
dead yay we did way worse that time how
are you feeling about this mission Nova
you want to try this one again Jack what
yeah let's try to guess right again go
again we're trying again I feel I would
feel bad if we if we left it all right
yeah if we hadn't closed how long do you
have to survive what's the time no 180
we need to kill 180 and and we've most
we've killed is 130 yeah should I stick
with the machine-gun or should I go to a
shotgun this is this is good for that
shotgun okay don't you don't change it
here you you change it in the loadout
screen Oh Oh change it in here
so then where's that breaker what's oh
we got a defender too
let's do it
shotgun specialist right now we're on
the couch for the stream we're just
using a controller though I would like
to use a mouse for this I think yeah I'm
laying down a turret drop an ammo and
lay it down over here
should I drop another turret yeah
dropping here right right
and I just killed myself I wanted to be
near the turret I successfully revived
people this time thank you
for change of pace you know oh yeah yeah
oh my god

Jack what are you doing all the way over
there he was sniping our turret
wait rich go out lower Oh
you got I got him
turn around
I got big guns coming in alright my
torts on cooldown
what happened did we fall off the edge
can you fall off the edge is that a
thing you can do
jack you gotta save as' I can't my time
cooldown right now I didn't even know
you could run off just live
nope nope nope nope okay no you're good
nope nope nope nope fuck it fuck it
let's go let's do it let's do it yeah oh
no I mean let's one more time one more
time one more time one more time again a
different mission and then we're gonna
do a different mission and then we need
a different mission remember Jack for
democracy for democracy do it for fights
with fish and his wife wife or
girlfriend or whoever it was that was
yelling it in and poor man
yeah I know
the side we can't fall off of okay yeah
that might be wise I'm dropping the
turret I'm putting it right up here
perfect
dropping mo
and dropping that machine gun so we have
another pickup in case we were on a
family things are desperate and it fell
on me my mom because everything is
clustered in this corner and that was
kind of dumb call me and call me in
already did I already called in a
reinforcements and I'm I can't go on
