[A - 00h00m to 00h05m]
hi Aereo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo mad max
what what you just everything about that
well don't I just I just don't rich I
just don't
I do wish there was a faster run it's
our car maybe I don't know dun dun
something there might be something you
can drive in this game maybe you people
are saying damn it now you can't change
your stats other people are saying your
stats are fine I didn't want to change
my stats my stats are fine I know you
guys were saying like the stats I chose
didn't mesh well with like the the
sideshows but that's hey that's just how
we're doing it okay
that's cuz that's furiosa she's a
complicated woman
I just don't rich that's the real thing
I don't and I don't want to I think this
apocalypse is industry indistinguishable
from just a like a slummy area in Texas
if you if anyone has ever driven between
California and Las Vegas this is just
what it looks like now you know this is
just modern-day what that looks like so
you know it's pretty good though they
got mutants can only assume I'm heading
back to the litter Sonny now there's a
carped let's go look at the cart some
into cart cart capture an engine on the
cart and driving around wouldn't that be
great
pick up cart okay okay
onward to the lady
yeah I know did I really go this far
away from town apparently it's not the
same town I don't know I think I'm
supposed to go to this well I mean I'm
going to the big arrow I don't know
where I'm supposed to go there's a big
arrow that says hey dummy come over here
and I need that oh hey there's a lady
how much other saying nice ass yeah
that's why I'm choosing the third person
perspective I wanna let you know dr.
sunny yeah these will do just fine just
fine
all right now we're gonna be making
something folks on the trail called
healing powder go on over to that
campfire now give it a try
okay you are in the same outfit it's
that awkward in the post-apocalypse
healing powder skill requirement can you
get your own dog I yield I assume how
many one okay that's not bad see all it
takes to make a recipe is the right
ingredients and the right know-how
hey-oh
crafting yep I don't like crafting me
games yeah I guess an annoying
I think the matically it's appropriate
though it's the for a game like this
sure you're in the apocalypse are get
goo ran you know getting scraps
everywhere never forgive me hey do me a
favor Trudy she's the bartender up at
the prospector kind of the town mom she
likes to meet newcomers she'd be cross
with me if I didn't ask you to poke your
head in and say hi
all right that's Cheyenne crafting just
feels like an extra step the game is
vacant we take yeah but it also makes
exploring more meaningful because you
just want to grab all the stuff you can
and I want to say in this game there's
like a weight thing yeah so if you're
holding too much stuff you move slower
and so then it's it's like you have to
choose what you grab and like oh I might
be able to craft this later it adds an
element I I understand it I agree it can
be tedious but I understand it in this
game I would like to run faster and
dramatic shot tenten tenten tenten
tenten tenten tenten oh I do that all
the time in games like T people are
talking I don't with a slow pan around
yeah that's


[A - 00h05m to 00h10m]
it's actually really bothersome that I
can't look at the front of her face
because I'd love to do like a all the
panoramic trailer shaft right oh yeah I
think everyone does that in games it's
fun it's a shin ematic oh it's getting
to be nighttime it's gonna be nighttime
rich there's danger it's exciting though
does avi start coming out of the ground
all around you at night that's quite
possible I did he'll somebody saying
there's a fast travel that's great I did
he'll I don't know if I did take a sip
of my canteen so I don't know if that
helped me heal okay okay but I did heal
and I don't believe I did anything to
heal hmm so if it is regenerating health
it's very slow regenerating out hold
down a stick to pan around we're talking
about with the character standing still
oh yeah like I know you can do this but
like if it was a third person game you
could Pan the camera and look at your
parents not a shooter not a shooter
right like in blood-borne you can look
at your character space
hi we got to talk to some lady now
saving can you put your gun away or does
everyone always just think of playing
there's not a part oh if I should put my
gun away
get out what the hell is your problem
yeah yeah your sucker they do that
silent protagonist yeah yeah noise when
everyone else talks and you don't use of
text that bothers me what it mean this
but this way you can give it you have a
beggar I would like to have audio with
it you could give your own voice if I
once I select the thing that I say I
would want the character
oh I dislike that more no no no that is
that's redundant I hate that cuz then I
look at it show me what yes yes this
takes me out of the game this takes me
out of the world
I don't like redundancy in games hey
show me what you have for sale after i
already read show me what you have for
sale hates Gorman Freeman Gordon Freeman
is not a character no he's using traitor
Ringo comes into town survivor of an
attack he says bad men after him needs a
place to hide we figured he was just in
shock so he gave him a place to lie low
we didn't actually expect anyone to come
after him he's holed up at the abandoned
gas station of the hill
you mean murder him that's not our way
even if Cobb is scum he can bluster and
threaten all he wants all right ma'am
she's talking to herself that just
annoys me no cuz then in my head I can I
can put my own voice to who's that man I
don't wanna I don't want to read the
text understand what it means and then
have someone else hear that just waste
time out there not much other than
they're a bunch of freeloaders who
expected a few rounds on the house I was
able to get them to pay up though it has
been working since I don't want to say
that I do care about your radio eye but
I also want to know where those guys go
I don't like you know I don't like that
kind of argument about it but the guy in
the checkered coat caps Justin um
sounded like they came in from the north
you're Corey Junction if that's the case
I can't say I blame them for not wanting
to go back that whole area is overrun
with the kind of critters that just get
mad if you shoot him merchants avoid
them no stretch of I 15 like it's
radioactive which it could be for all I
know
hahaha I didn't hear exactly but then
finger 783 just signed his death warrant
little chat yeah we just said half-life
is pissed
I think I think they're going to tear em
apart like rabid wolves I mean Krieger
you're you're wrong and that's fine
I have no strong opinion I actually
missed out on half-life
when a half-life came at the time
half-life came out my computer wasn't up
to the snuff sure and by the time I did
have a computer up at the snuff there
were other games I was playing so I


[A - 00h10m to 00h15m]


[B] great I got some sarsaparilla
do-do-do-do-do hey Ringo Ringo what did
this come on I have no idea
that's the chat it looks relatively bad
I mean I think it was a while ago I
don't know if that's the floating us
because you're doing at the third person
sure that's close enough
who are you what do you want with me
sorry about the gun you just caught me
off guard that's all we got off to a bad
start
what say we start over with a friendly
game of Caravan you know how to play
yeah he doesn't look Betty has to do in
this role-playing
you can hear the audible frustration in
his voice even though he's not actually
vocalizes frustration you can hear it
like his breathing you can somehow hear
it in his posture it's a it's it's it's
a tough thing with a role-playing game
cuz like what if my character is
different my character doesn't want to
hear all this bullshit why don't you try
shooting at me out of it no no make sure
the crimson caravan pays you back you've
got my word just go off the rails go
off-script Jack die shooting him say
I'll consider it and then go into vats
aim for his head that first shot off if
you're not having fun and this becomes
frustrating stream she's been friendlier
than we may as well we may as well mix
it up a bit
why can you pick his pocket just get his
gun
they can't know I was just lying there
he's not moving why is it not a hundred
percent shot he's not moving I'll say
first let's just see what happens to to
to rob somebody sink crunch first them
pickpocket you've lost karma out of here
it's Karma
yeah oh you have the gun can't shoot me
now bitch hey he's got another gun he's
got another gun doo doo doo doo doo I
need to build up small points you gotta
fight they build up pretty quick
take a chance with a headshot you think
yeah another headshot I only get one
okay Rico head crippled yet he can still
shoot me
what the fuck Bobby knew even bobbin and
Weavin here we go now I get two shots

robot on the way so I've lost a bunch of
karma oh it's fine it's fine I don't
think you care about karma I don't care
about karma and I can only imagine like
the Karma effects have people treat me
or whatever so maybe murder enough

people that's all I care about any
post-apocalypse somebody is saying you
can mod in sprinting oh now that's a
spice is fast and it uses up action
points Oh interesting
I like that that almost seems what's
that what are the tiny arrows maybe yeah
like enemies hold X to put away gun away
and run faster oh oh yeah thank you
thank you
these are the important things to know
how to run faster hoho oh yes we weren't
we were greeting subs newby newby
piloted donut you noob average Oh fucker
Jack he's a noob he doesn't get respect
Wow he doesn't get respect to at least
four point five streams that's how it
works oh all right I mean that's fine
that's that's how you plain it
somebody else's I think you can pan
around your character when your weapon a
stowed oh well you know what we will
check that out
you can have your epic panorama shot
similar to snap that will give you more
action points or faster recharging
please take issue with that I start
hitting you for this shit - huntin
geckos but you're not dead yet alright
yes you hate the dialogue it seems like
you should have one with the character
of low intelligence that's it they're at
element yeah but you didn't nope because
I don't listen
really right fucking in the head the
kind of gun is rich using well I'm not
using any guns as I am not playing the
game
gecko meat I think I need to eat meat
because my health is low
let's eat meat do-do-do-do-do items
bloat fly meat seems like you should
move right health by eating the blowfly
meat what is that red per second it's
radioactive oh yay oh there you go fuck
it I'll be radioactive how'd that do
that didn't that did not aid me much
let's try some eating some more shit
gecko meat
P plus 1 I'm numb now I'm alive some
healing powder well it's good enough
good enough
oh my god you can cook the meat at the
campfire oh so you can't eat raw meat
that's what they're saying no I ate it
already
oh you can maybe just don't get as much
health from it maybe yeah that meat is
rare enough great so else it's fine the
radiation has burned all the diseases
wake up that's funny
I think the things you say is funny
Oh welcome to level 2 yay yay oh yeah
we're great at unarmed combat using a
shopping but I'm using a shotgun
you can try an armed combat that's a
good idea I'm gonna even melee weapons
I'm great ed what do we want bombs are a
mere 18 fries let's go ahead 1 2 guns
sad all of them the guns
no all right there
prepare to maintain any weapons it
allows you to create items that way yeah
that sounds good speak we do if I could
take away stuff from speak I would
Oh sneak medicine sneak great and hello
mister Stremme stir mister what he said
hello I said hey rich and Jack hi hey
welcome to level 2 she only took us
three hours swift learner come on
if to learner come on if to learn

[C] with each rank in the Swift learner perk
you'll gain an additional 10% of total
experience points whenever experience
points are earned well that seems nice
who would do more damage against female
opponents I likes that Swift learner
that soon to be good
I can choose another one too great done
great let's uh let's use a different
weapon I have a cleaver machete huh yeah
I got a cleaver okay I'll give it a try
at least I can't just walk right up
these rocks that's great somebody
somebody wants to know this is your
first video again this is my first video
game ever it's true it's my first video
game ever and so far you know I'm
alright with it
can't walk up that rock if I gotta go
around all these rocks
you got this rack somebody says you
fucked yourself jack you leveled the
resistance of Fallout Matt okay how
about that how about that oh I think I
sit for my canteen great I leveled the
resistance of Fallout what did I level
Swift learner swift learner what does
that one do know that that gave me more
experience points
10% more experience points okay no why
would you go to that one
the damage do a distance with melee
weapon probably not very good all right
let's see what happens this might not be
the best you might want to just wagon
things right now okay with your wagon
that's not working
take that back now go back to Vance whoa
you need more guns apparently I need
more guns
I can whack at him nine times three
times though so that's something this
doesn't seem to be working either
there's a big one
there's my machete sausage melee weapons
are overpowered you're gonna do fine
with them like you know what I'm gonna
put this out there I just don't think
that's true in my and using a melee
weapon twice now crazy come here
you dick is he flame he's fleeing you
have two different weapons that you can
switch between that would seem to make
sense if you could switch between a gun
and a melee weapon that would be nice
there was some I thought I saw something
in the menu for a RV two quick switch up
first
Oh check it out okay um what do they
have my shotgun shotgun your hotkey it
right button
there's oh you can put it on the d-pad
looks like or the number pad because
this is a computer
sure okay so that's my shotgun and I
could put like my 10 millimeter down
there so let's see what happens
hey you know with the d-pad you can do
with the d-pad yeah not what I wanted to
do I'm on a shitty back and broad
machete
you can fling the jinxes you could do
fine damage with whatever weapon style
you invest perks and skill points into
melee gets really fun at higher levels
and doesn't cost them out oh sure great
now we'll keep giving it it will keep
giving a hell somebody else's get him to
go to sleep so the health restores oh
yeah
yeah there was this thing how long would
you like to wait an hour how long you
normally sleep
did it happen health try eight hours
eight hours sleep just like it go six
okay I'll sleep for six hours I didn't
gain any health nope I think you're full
of shit
waiting is not sleeping waiting is not
sleeping maybe that's it
well then how the fuck do you have the
option to do one and not the other then
how the fuck do you sleep why do those
need to be two different controls I
don't understand things how do you sleep
you need a bed to sleep
fuck you you need a bed to sleep they
want you to find a bet you find a bed
I'll just jump off that cliff is fine be
fine he's fine
Tina didn't know you enough talking yeah
you can no fast travel yay great no he
did not annoy me need to get over this
fucking mountain uh I've got I should
take a bed with you you killed that guy
earlier he doesn't need that bed anymore
that would be great yeah like a roll up
bed you could take with I'm gonna make
sense yeah I got like a knapsack like a
sleeping bag like a camping sleeping
kind of bag Canada thing who's over here
jump there's a tent it's in the tent hey
dude
great can I go in sleep how long would
you like to see six hours somebody
thinks this is boring as for work yeah F
works kind of boring
hey there's my health great huh people
love the fallouts I think people love
playing the fallouts I don't think they
like watching other people play at
fallouts or I'm just so bad what's the
consensus Chad I think it's also like
the fact that I don't really care about
what's happening yeah um
means that like maybe I'm not as
enthusiastic about the game so I'm not
being as entertaining that could also be
a thing what you're saying is this is
not a game we're going to go and play I
can't imagine I don't like the talkies I
know you don't that's why I was shocked
you want to play this people who you
know what I just I wanted some it's it
was so long since I've played fallout3
and everyone's talking about fallout 4 I
wanted some frame of reference for like
what the game is you know so it's done
that for me it's like alright if this is
the kind of game it is it's probably
just not a game for me here we go here
we go get into the caravan I'm gonna
machete some other fuckers I'm gonna
machete motherfuckers in the face Oh
frag grenade yes yes what is that
pork and beans fuck yeah I'll take some
pork and beans empty its it says it's
empty oh that's good all right all right
we got some grenades we got some pork
and beans
yeah actually like this seems like a
game that you would really be into which
was why I was surprised that you weren't
you said you weren't really into
I'm cuz stream is a terrible place to
experience a story-based game that's a
taco this is kind of game you would need
to spend your own time getting into it
oh yeah well I'm just surprised you you
haven't is what I'm saying make a lot of
games they do make a lot of games that's
true I see and thanks to jr. P jeez I
don't I don't
sure because when I think of when I
think of RPG unfortunately thanks to
Squaresoft III think of like spiky
haired fifteen-year-old obnoxious
Japanese children with rare and
convoluted storytelling and bad stories
I just noticed something great being
railroaded into a series of events that
I have no control over and I'm lousy
combat system these are all things I
just associated surely without BG's sure
sir check us out I just discovered
something look at the coyote pups health
yeah do you see how all of the health
bar is down yeah which means if I make
the shot I kill him in one head yeah I
didn't notice that so that's how you
know okay what you need well you don't
know how much damage that hits gonna
take off yeah they do oh it says how
much like with with the mom coyote that
I killed because I did I killed the mama
I killed this family of coyotes because
I'm a heartless bastard um here you will
see when we fight our next bigger well
not yet dr. J turn-based combat isn't
lousy art JRPG turn-based combat is
lousy
okay what do you mean
and I know all RPGs aren't like JRPGs
it's just it's just a bad taste in my
mouth from those early JRPGs I have like
notions in my head that I know aren't
always true but when I think of RPGs
I think of JRPGs and it's a bad fun sure
yeah oh there's a big coyote you'll see
you'll see about this whole health
system like it's like imprinting or
something yeah no I mean you it's it's
Association yeah you've associated you
know RPGs only with JRPGs come here cuz
that's what an RPG was when I was
younger yeah see so do you see now the
flashing down at the bottom yeah okay so
then if I say hit him once and like if I
hit him again
ah again that's nice that's very helpful
I'm learning and then it's smacking fuck
yeah critical strike I am learning fuck
you okay okay let me take your meat I'll
fall off this cliff I'm gonna fucking
eat you you're mine now you are mine
take your hide to him can I wear his
coyote hide look at you motherfucker
come here coyote den mother like I gave
a shit and your pup - oh can you just
sneak by them you get to kill these
these poor dogs
trying to make a living as best I can in
this horrible world I guess I did I
guess I did have to do that search the
pup eat the meat now I'm gonna eat your
meat
great let's see what's down this road I
can't go down the thing yet
instead I need to be like level 25 to go
down the thing so I'm just gonna go over
here and look for people to kill what

of the most attractive women who has
ever lived

wasn't angry as the Hulk but that's

better than the Incredible Hulk then
Edward Norton sulk it at least you know
at least it had some style to it
angley's Hulk the ending was a bit
pretentious yes I know she was in Dark
City that's one of my favorite movie is

a dick melee girl
it's kind of weird way everybody has the
same fucking jacket well that's the area
we're in is like the jacket area yeah
well it's the apocalypse they mass
produce these beat-up jackets well
they're leather their leather is very
strong but they look the same
you didn't make something I love her
that much difference I suppose
all right great that's fine
place to sleep Oh is stimpak I think
that's like hell can you be murdered
while you're sleeping if you good them
if you couldn't be both annoying and
great I agree
well I need to eat something I think if
I eat stuff oh it looks like there's bad
guys in the next room
rich what does Mike love so much about
The Rocketeer everything about it I love
it too it's just a very solid superhero
movie we both loved that movie
independently of one another because I
didn't know Mike when I first saw The
Rocketeer and I was a kid I fucking
loved The Rocketeer and it flopped in
the theaters but like probably possibly
my favorite movie that summer yeah yeah
solid story solid characters art deco
goodness I mean that that fucking helmet
that outfit the outfit is fucking
gorgeous the outfit is genuinely
everything about that costume the rocket
pack looks great Jennifer Connelly isn't
it Jennifer Connelly's that did not do
much to to raise my health I'll tell you
that
that's fine let's just get it up a
little bit more
yeah all these things like raise my help
with health one points rich did you play
or like Dark Void kind of similar to
racketeer no not just that's a similar
that you have a helmet in the backpack
that's that's kind of about it
helmet backpack and you know pretty much
the same time period but like Dark Void
you're flying around an alternate
dimension and weirdness and gameplays
kind of bad kind of kind of mediocre
more than bad Dark Void is highly
mediocre they didn't integrate the
flying backpack with the shooting
mechanics enough it's like two different
games cuz you're gonna have to I mean
them in a limited game you fly around
with a Jack jetpack but there's a lot of
ground-based cover shooting which
doesn't mesh at all with the concept of
running around with a jet pack
sure Jack Jack you use a stim pack for
the love of God that's stim pack
exclamation point rich with your beard
on the broken age of you you look like a
down-on-his-luck J well fuck you too
honestly that's a terrible thing to say
food heals you over time it heals 1 hp
per second great I'll use this Tim back
there oh yeah that did that did a much
better job feeling me where are all
these bad guys I see oh god he's not
going to open this door I did it no I
did it okay I opened the door
it took me it took me a little bit okay
all right who's in here some bitches I
was something decent I love using the
vast system for these to any little guys
I think it's Larry's okay bottle caps
what what I'm sure this is all very
in-depth and wonderful if they find it
her if they find it hard to play hockey
fallout they wouldn't be able to get
through Witcher 3 I love it oh you're
playing and everything is they they they
they they they and and also like you've
gone out of your way to be like Jack I
knew this wasn't a game for you that's
why you're playing you're Jack you're
playing with the controller because I
would never do that Jack is playing this
and Jack has troubles with these games
so yes we're not cursed to be lumped
together no matter what no matter one
you know rich and I have very different
opinions about games I know we we agree
we have agreed on most of our episodes
but overall just weird
it is weird isn't it yes but I want a
good minor disagreements like I've been
I've been mediocre on things that you
have loved yeah that's true and vice
versa I'll probably
yeah so it's just like no jack has a
problem with this because I don't like
the talkies I think rich would actually
really enjoy this game so much so that
it really surprised me when when I heard
he hasn't played it I assumed that this
would kind of be right up his alley
and meet Maude beer great great no I am
you know Mike I think there was a time
in my life where I could have gotten
into a game like this you know I just
don't know if I have the time anymore
activate well I mean as far as like
talking in games I'm the one who refuses
to skip a cutscene no matter how many
times I've seen it before
yeah that's rich I think rich would
really enjoy this game and I might I've
heard some great things about Witcher 3
but I know the first one though the
combat just gave me such a sour taste
Witcher yeah the first one okay alright
I think we beat the bandits but yeah I
mean I'm still wasn't it wasn't any kind
of talking in The Witcher one that
turned me off it was the combat system
oh I'm still working on beating
blood-borne for Christ's sake ain't got
no time for Witcher
what's that guy why are so many people
shit talking the string is Europe hahaha
yeah it's just Europe yeah oh my god
that's hideous dead now that I figured
out oh my god that is really giant a
little bit more about the combat I feel
a little more confident why aren't there
a billion more it's in hand no wonder
that guy had ant meets and I was like oh
there would be nothing worse than giant
answer no they've made movies about this
yeah what if you could ride him like
ride the giant ants into battle Tallyho
yes you're just frightening giant ants
are frightening yes
ooh bark scorpion poison gland I wonder
what that is
I could use that more giant ants
critical strike yay take his fucking
head off rich have you ever been to
Europe I can barely afford to cross the
street I've seen you cross the street at
least once it was pretty exciting for
all of us
oh and see like when your crosshair gets
over them it turns red that's when you
know you can hit them that's fucked fuck
there's a big one doohickey too says
guns for the love of God guns I don't
give a fuck I'm the hit and answer the
machete what is more fun than hitting
answer the machete look at that shooting
answer the shotgun that might be fun I'm
hacking ants to pieces with a machete
and I think that's fun this is how I'm
playing the game gathering all the ant
meat I can oh what's happening why did I
start crouching The Rocketeer will not
be the next hour alone commentary track
you don't think I don't think I I in
fact I know it's not going to be the
next one what what
I started slow walking for some reason
rich what did you want to do as a career
originally a lottery winner that was
that was the first thing I wanted to do
yeah that's hard it's hard to break into
though no yeah yeah it's a tough field a
lot of people looking to get it oh yeah
a lot of competition I haven't tried
just punching an aunt maybe they should
try punching an aunt obviously anything
to be better at lock-picking
but seriously registry consider your
trash talking of Europe
I'm not trash talking having a bit of
fun it's like when I talk about soccer
and how awful soccer is you know I
really don't care that the Europeans
like such a horrible sport it's all good
fun it's it's it's a universal sport
it's so universal sport flooring
everybody kicks a wall and and it's also
a very affordable sport you know yeah
good to watch the ball just kind of go
around the middle field you know you
know what I'd like to see in soccer
smaller nets and no goalies kind of like
basketball somebody would hang back and
try to kick the ball away the feet
though you know you have an area where
you where that you your team couldn't go
in you know you have a defender you'd
have defenders but no no specific goalie
and then it'd be it then you know you
get a little more score a little more
back and forth I'd like that
just just switch to hockey hockey
there's a lot like soccer only at any
moment you can have a heart attack as
the game is so exciting I'm not much for
hockey I just pour it on my weapon I'm
all my points into melee weapons see
look what I'm doing
like I'm like crouching and in hockey
somebody could score or die at any given
moment yeah yeah why am i walking so
slow I don't know storm
don't you see wind
something's going on here something is
going on here and I don't know what it
is
Chad you're in Oh Jack what there's a
weight thing your inventories too full
yes thank you
fuckin hell alright let's get let's get
rid of some shit
you're no Giles Corey dad my dad died
don't even understand that I mean always
probably one of them biggest badasses
okay the Salem witch trials okay and I
know that is one of the accused I
believe and they wanted him to appear
although they wanted to like testify
okay he didn't want to concede it was
all bullshit and so they they they they
pressed him baby pressed they they they
took him outside and they kept putting
larger and larger rocks on him when he
agreed to to plead guilty or innocent I
believe okay
and when they kept asking him yelling do
you want to enter a plea he just said he
till he died he just kept saying more
wait nice you know what that's a badass
right there
boom boom okay it's basically eight all
my wolf is basically ate all my wolf is
basically
