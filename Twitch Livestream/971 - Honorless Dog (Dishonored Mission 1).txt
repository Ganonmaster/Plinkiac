should we should be on Zen even having
any any problems with the stream is
everything cool is everything good
everything working hello
I've got dishonored here I absolutely
fucking love Dishonored I am absolutely
in love with this game right now and
we're gonna have we're gonna have a nice
quiet rich solo stream because I'm I'm
totally gonna get lost in this game I
know cam well yeah there's a good reason
though this this game much much like
thief is best played in the dark and I
could turn the camera on but you
wouldn't be able to see shit the camera
is black is the camera still trying to
to show up and double-check that are you
still trying oh you're still trying to
show up Thanks there you go
hang a fixed totally fixed alright I'm
I'm going to warm up by embarrassing
myself with the combat I'd totally do my
best to play this game stealthily
so just have you know a well-rounded
game because I'm constantly playing the
main story stuff as I can
fearless still I'm gonna do maybe this
is some combat just just to be
well-rounded man no end of the breach
end of the breach is great but currently
dishonored is my gym
my screens a little bit dark I think I
think I can deal with that someone's
down I know you're somewhere around
say um this is about as much as I'm
gonna be talking what motors this is the
dunwall City trials this particular one
is the alley street boy it's going to be
bad I hate those dogs
Oh is another dog where's it at maybe I
can kill the one come here come here I'm
gonna kill you stop you know the combat
engine of this despite the fact that I'm
trying to play the games the stealth as
I can
the combat engine in this kind of great
[Music]
just disappear we know you're here link
me yeah die motherfucker don't you got
game what you've got
[Applause]
[Music]
yes anybody thinking of playing this why
I love this game I wanted to play this
when it came out my computer wasn't
quite up to it I got it
fairly early on but I was getting like
20 frames a second
where's my mouse pad
my aim always seems weird when I play
here at the studio I think this mouse
pad is just awful
yes rich solo Jack is ill
all right you're doing okay ish I'd like
to maybe have another help file when I
find you it's going bad good rats oh you
can summon enough swarms of rats and
literally eat people alive and it's the
coolest fucking thing fucking corpse
I wouldn't push this guy over the ledge
but I just hit him over I don't have the
power for that yet
what's got it is that that my hands not
be restless reveal yourself
give yourself up come out both know
you're weak at home
I didn't want to up you keep going
stop like see you
[Music]
nope no into the bridge
I like into the breach I also like the
solder
missed I missed bedtime to miss
[Music]
Cowboys I love the tallboys there
they're a great visual and they're kind
of fun to fight
[Music]
[Music]
goddess
[Music]
No
don't kill the corpse but the organ
grinder
he's my kryptonite
oh you're stuck in there you might be
impossible to kill ever
that would suck if I get stuck on wave
fucking 12
dog
that guy's music box blocks off my magic
powers
sees he's bad news
can you get unstuck
where'd he go Oh oh no I'm at Wave 12 of
the 13 waves and I'm fucked
he's glitched in there no no
oh right at the end
I think his legs are invulnerable
time to play into the bridge uh fuck
into the breach why do you people deny
me my good time why
I can't really shoot with these slits
he's not actually there
what can I do it blow em out
now try to shoot his feet all right I'm
pretty sure they're invaluable
hello
oh well huh so do i retry this as actual
feet
all right well try shooting this actual
feet
and now I'm completely out of ammo now
that a method of matters anyway
hello fuck it fuck it
he's pretty good pretty good entrapped I
had that happen once before all right
I'll start a new game Springs a little
bit dark I'm gonna I'm gonna crank up
the brightness a bit for me I don't know
how it's showing up for you on this TV
it's a bit dark
[Music]
all right
ah I think I got a normal save I'm good
III like into the breach I haven't
played it I'm gonna put a bid
I haven't played into the breach to
completion though Corvo if only there
was someone else I trusted to send so
that you could remain near but there is
no one else and the spy master was right
to insist that I send you the plague has
taken so many and we must find a cure
when you are near my heart is at peace
Emily and I will count the days until
you return hurry home and bring good
news
watch it
what kind of name is Corvo fictional
fantasy universe name this this doesn't
take place in any kind of Earth history
kind of dunwall tower what Corvo has
news for the Empress and we've come a
long way vaguely steampunker Suns black
magic superstition for all we know
there's a cure for the plague by now
wailing part of this world economy big
whale big goopy will monks that's
unusual we need help with the Rattler
[Music]
I love the crazy world in this game yeah
I mean this game reminds me a lot of
these a lot it's the spiritual successor
to theif the mechanically have been
different I I originally tried playing
this like me and thief was very much
about hiding in the shadows this this
game does not give a flying fuck about
shadows it's all line of sight
the Empress would be waiting for your
news for though their voyage sir it's
been good traveling with you Corvo
have you ever met my niece Calista she's
getting more beautiful every year I got
feeling I'll meet her later in the game
yes yes the pressure was too low hello
sir you're back we tell me about your
trip please
were there any wheels wait let's play
hide-and-seek first I'll cover my eyes
and you hide me you have time
well there's busy talking to that nasty
old spy master yes combat is the other
big difference between this and thief
okay
combat is very much a viable strategy in
this it wasn't the evo really good it
wasn't it wasn't intended to be come on
combat and thief was intended to be a
little bit clunky and last resort
[Music]
let's see if you're so good at this I'll
hide my eyes and count and at the end of
the countdown
I'll shy and find you okay I'm going to
count to ten
find a place I'd
stealth tutorial is a hide in the seat
game with the Empress's daughter it's
adorable you can you can lean around
corners standard it would spider-man
villain I've always been fond of Doc Ock
face game it's too dark in here for a
facecam I'm playing a game that you
really want to play in the dark
I beat a little girl a hide-and-seek did
you see my nanny says the big ocean is
full of them but I think she only says
that to scare me later will you show me
that TV in chokehold like you promised
I walked her mother don't you show her
that same chokehold and the intro to
Dishonored 2 - did they reference that
if you were listening to that thing she
just said welcome Lord Protector stop
moving Campbell and you Corvo
welcome back wherever you been they sent
him all around the aisles to beg for aid
a waste of time my elixir will banish
the playing from this city now keep
still a moment I overseer Campbell I'm
not so sure that painting looks like
Campbell
we saw my improvements to the water lock
see what I'm forced to paint the high
overseer is no beauty I'm sure the
Empress is eager to see you knew it was
a fool's errand Corvo the plague comes
from inside us we must all strengthen
our faith I oversee her I must ask you
to hold your pose no foreigner can save
us from the consequences of a corrupt
society no fancy elixirs either remember
to every man his choice to every man his
fate and by the way here's a cute little
thing he's painting him I'm gonna grab
the bottle what are you doing
I need the bubble to draw the eye away
from Campbell I suppose I can paint him
without the cider though in truth he is
always close to this stuff
she'll see you at once
they're sick people not criminals we've
gone beyond that question your majesty
Emily just glitched out save them from
the plague if we can all of them very
well we will not speak of this again
mother
Corvo is back thank you Emily leave us
please
as you wish your majesty
hi okay common to weird glitches tonight
in today's that doesn't usually happen
love surprises that's usual it's a fair
wind that brings you home to me what
news have you brought
emily has blink
she's already allied with the outsider
I hope that one of the other cities had
dealt with this before
knew of some cure this news is very bad
we're at the breaking point cowards
they're going to blockade us they'll
wait to see if the plague turns the city
into a graveyard are you ok mother you
seem sad yes don't worry darling mother
is fine wait where are the guards who
sent them away
[Music]
[Music]
Corvo thank you if you hadn't been here
not again
[Music]
Corvo it's all coming apart fine find
Emily protect her you're the only one
he'll know what to do
won't you carve Oh Corvo you had one job
what a solve look at what he's done
yes he's killed the Empress
what did you do with young lady Emily
traitor her own bodyguard ironic I'll
see you beheaded for this cargo take him
I was rich resisting playing into the
breach because I am absolutely fucking
in love with dishonored this is scratch
from a thief's itch hilarious how they
automatically assumed he's guilty
who do you think's behind this shit it's
a setup sign the confession and that he
give me the rights to put your spirit at
ease
[Applause]
that's enough for now
get out better than Vanquish well you're
talking about apples and oranges to
think but maybe God almost certainly
empress isn't dead her daughter Emily is
hidden away and no one will ever know
the truth yes unlucky you tomorrow
you'll be executed but it's for a good
cause this country needs strong
leadership now something to guide the
weak and that's where we come in there
was nothing personal in this even though
you almost sank our plans but it turned
out well you were in the wrong place at
the right time and someone has to take
the fall
goodbye
but they come back to itself
you should eat Corvo this meal comes
from the friend trip so we're in jail
what there's something hitting under our
bread it's a key to the door all right
yeah basically is this people helping
you get out they want they want your
assistance
[Music]
planning full stealth or assassin Roger
mixed I haven't finished the game for
one I'm about halfway through and people
are I'll kill sometimes I'm not I'm not
playing bloodless right social event for
the high and mighty
come see the noble Lord Protector get
his head chopped off I slaughter the
innocent guards fuck up and convention
the solitary Wing is off-limits to
maintenance this guy turns around before
I could knock him out he's gone
is this a spiritual successor to the
theme it's the it's the closest you'll
find to a spiritual successor to theme
yes
like I I was doing bad early on and this
and is honored to really cuz I I kept
trying to rely on on shadows and
dishonor doesn't really care about how
how dark you are it doesn't care if
you're hidden in shadow it cares we've
hidden behind some dignitaries
this game looks very halflife tuition I
have I have recently heard that a lot of
the guy who did art for this game who
did some design work worked on half-life
2 so that's there's probably a good
reason why you're reminded of half-life
2
hello is anyone there alright
sometimes this kind of turns around when
I'm sneaking up on and I don't know why
I'll take that coin
attention tomorrow's execution will be
restricted to the personnel assigned to
the event and approves dignitaries only
so far we're doing great
the stream has no owner that's that's
what I should have titled this dream
this stream has no honour
[Music]
you like hiding people on chandeliers
what so they fall over and hurt
themselves when they wake up after you
leave how's the audio
can things good good
Mackworth your lazy slug sorry not yet I
was gonna report that boiler leak from
yesterday forget it
just do your rounds or reports trouble
for both of us
I'm moving
[Music]
attention
tomorrow's execution will be restricted
to the personnel assigned to the event
and approved dignitary homeland
[Music]
I'd like to get that guy's key
I just want to find a good time to sneak
up on
I fuck up here they'll be blood
I had unless accompanied by an officer
of the wall escort
huh
I didn't want to do that but I couldn't
have him alerting everyone else I feel
bad about that that man had a family
[Music]
will be restricted to the personnel
assigned to the event and approved
dignitaries only let me know if you want
to take my patrol flow off
[Music]
I want to make sure he can't see when I
take this guy out
almost almost undetected almost
[Music]
a no deathrun I that would take too long
me to spend a whole day just playing
this
look at I'm looking at that guy in the
upstairs I'm looking at him he's turned
around now we going for the kill
nope
or the be not killed
[Music]
[Music]
I have a nice collection of a conscious
men what do I look like Kevin Spacey to
you
[Music]
whole group of guards up there I don't
want to see me staying underwater
yeah as original only stream jackass
sick that it
Lahab Ridge steals their possessions
before choking them yeah man master
pickpocket I am so my allies have
stashed weapons for me in the sewers
watch for booby traps could be some down
here by the look of it all right if
we're lucky one of them will get Corvo
you're afraid of him he's sir Conan it's
all merchants and whores down there kids
like you you never saw what he was like
I saw him fight three two one in the
practice yard I hope it's me that finds
him I don't
I haven't watched a full-on speedrun of
this game I have seen videos of people
who are basically just fucking showing
off though added it made me feel so
awful about myself and my own skills
there's people out there who have turned
playing this game into a fucking art
form
oh man this is gonna be a perfect ghost
except for that one guy who spotted me
and I had to kill him I hate those guys
I hate that guy who made me kill sewers
are full of people by the way who have
died from the plague
still on things
do over yeah man you got to live with
your mistakes
turn over
[Music]
that's to know the elixir preventive
maybe either way let's just dump them
down there go rats
I love this little puzzle you need to
get to that thing but all those rats are
there so we just throw some bodies on
the ground and that distracts the rats
which ever played this I never played
the first one my computer was too crap
when this first came out
and I had it but I was getting 20 frames
per second yeah maybe someday and
someday came
by the way there are booby traps
that's that's a tripwire there but if I
trip that I will get shot it's another
one right here so uh we're gonna disarm
the traps
now that I've played this what do I
think I'm absolutely in love with this
[Music]
when was this released six years ago
[Music]
what you actually do in this game
stealth
I just slid under a tripwire you know as
you do
all right this all kinds of little
there's no details they put in here my
gears are safe with some information
they give you a hint on where you can
find the combination to this safe they
hint that it's the whiskey you check
your whiskey and this is whiskey shelf
over here and you can I don't know if
you can read that if it's too dark
thirty numbers four or five one
I might like Splinter Cell I had thought
that Splinter Cell was more linear like
metal here where there's certain ways
she's supposed to get around things and
it's not really that open like a thief
or a Dishonored
you won't get past me you know I'll try
to but I've heard someone say that
splinter cell's bit more like thief so
maybe I'll try to make a lot I'll give
it a shot
knock something over if you can bastard
did we kill this guy it's probably safer
to kill him honestly smells like a
deadly bird here yeah I did it why would
you kill him uh easier less chance of
alerting the other guard not getting out
this way on my watch
I mean I'll admit I probably didn't have
to kill that guy there is another way
but the the drop kill was just easier to
do and less risky man you're such a
chopper
you have slate bolts I'd like to not use
them just yet
wretches cold-blooded a little bit
I'm bloodier when I play this than I am
when I play the thief when I play thief
killing people it just it feels
unprofessional it feels like I was a bad
cat burglar when you have to kill
somebody in theif here though I'm an
assassin it's fine
these guys have just tappers oh they're
big-time tappers
[Music]
our fair inference and the disappearance
of lady emily heir to the throne has
temporarily estate over here
[Music]
I'm Samuel and I worked with some good
people who want very much to meet you
they said you'd come out here
I could still hardly believe it I'll
take you to meet them just down the
river from here
all right how did you unconscious bodies
found that sucks wondering which ones
they found who got discovered man who
got discovered wait can you kill Samuel
as far as I know at some point you can
kill everyone in this game hostiles
killed - I'll see y'all take it low
chaos that's good low chaos is good
I do want low chaos the ones you didn't
hide rich well who found them who found
them
this is the Hound pits pub closed for
business after district marked off is
dead from the plague were right under
the Lord Regents nose and he don't know
a thing
[Music]
of course if anyone finds out what we're
up to the watch will break in with
swords drawn and now that you've escaped
the Lord Regent is going to be tearing
the city apart
[Music]
take you up to meet Admiral Havelock the
rest of the loyalists the Admirals a man
to be reckoned with if anyone can help
you find that missing girl lady Emily
and clear your name
I expect they're hard at work in there
let's join them they'll help you again
whoever really killed the Empress
even after six months and cold ridge
prison he slipped out like it was
nothing
yes not surprising he was the personal
bodyguard of the Empress you've heard
the stories yes I have it still amazes
me that someone could get to the Empress
and young lady Emily no one knows the
real story Trevor we all have our
suspicions we'll know the truth in time
he's strong and quick but I hope he
understands subtlety as well this isn't
one of your fancy dress parties the
reality is that we need men killed have
you ever killed a man
only with my wind but it's a fair point
as always he'll be here soon and I'm
looking forward to meeting him all right
so so many the chat says why are these
guys so sure you didn't assassinate the
Empress um I don't think they really
give a shit these people are they're
trying to use us they're trying to use
us and that's that's okay that's okay we
can continue this later Lord Pendleton
the man of the hour is here
Corvo I'm Admiral Havelock a true
servant of the Empire like you until the
Lord Regent purged those of us who
wouldn't recognize his claim on the
throne and I'm Lord sever Pendleton
I represent the nobility in our little
group but we all act as equals here at
the Hound pits
this is a momentous occasion cause I'm
going to come out with we've been
building a coalition of loyalists aimed
at ending the Lord region's tyranny and
restoring throne at risk of execution
were committed to finding young lady
Emily and seeing her crowned as Empress
we've got big plans but we can't do any
of it without you
we need your skills your ability in a
fight and in helping us we're going to
help you destroy the men who murdered
the Empress sorry you must be exhausted
we can discuss this further after you've
recovered but before you retire you
should introduce yourself to Piero he's
challenged it's time it's not spoilers I
haven't finished the game I actually
have not finished this game but I double
cross a mile away
he's going to be crafting the gear
you'll need go talk to him and they
smelled that shit coming a mile away
good to have you with us nothing against
the others but there's no substitute for
a man who's done a service for the
growling look at me common beggar
my only question with the double-crosses
maybe is it is it only if you have a
high chaos kind of thing if you kill a
lot of people or does one or the other
double-cross you depending upon whether
or not you're higher low chaos that
those are my only real questions but I'm
pretty sure there will be a double-cross
I'll be crafting your weapons and gear
all custom work for you
kappa now the tank of whale oil will you
get a new tank from upstairs please
while I hold this in place be careful
oils unstable when it explodes there's a
terrible mess and if you read all these
things they appear in your notes I read
them later
I'm just gonna steal all your stuff
along here I know you're my a life and
I'm just gonna steal all of your stuff
all this all this optional or just
sitting all over the place overflowing I
could slowly increase pressure on a
subject over a long period of time and
then observe them for years to see if
the formulation of energetic substances
developed surely the Empress would be
able to if you like Laura what's a good
game subjected doing I believe it or not
now why do
get it near the receptacle magnetism
will do the rest
perfect thank you here see the assassins
mask you're a wanted man so everyone in
the city knows your face is Tarrant you
just hold still fit must be precise
there can you see normally they're
better now I could create more food
upgrades for your gear weapons munitions
but our situation is desperate
scavenge the city for valuables and I
will resell them on the black market
that should give us the money to craft
the things you need Jeff Simon honk and
steampunk
don't need to fight each other they can
coexist
upgrades Oh
what's priority one here crossbow and
accuracy as well with mask optics and
that's what I can afford for now but
we're gonna do fuckload of sleep darts
oh wait I forgot to buy combat her life
who darts now all more difficult soon
you should afford them later and you can
very well you know best let me know if
you need anything more
both capacity for more sleep darts ah
you know what I can choke some guys out
I don't want to be utterly reliant on
the sleep Dart
all right so should I loop this area or
should we just get on with the game you
know do it quick a quick run around and
I want to be able to afford more those
upgrades or anything over here there is
my time
are you rating dumpsters it's so fucking
pathetic so horribly pathetic traffic is
forbidden from landing in the Distillery
District due to risk of infectious
contact violators will be taken to the
flooded district for treatment and
rehabilitation
I do I do want to afford more upgrades
so I think I think looting is an order
later notice later there's something
down there
my you must be Corvo
I am Lydia at your service your room is
upstairs and ready when they told me who
it was well I thought you'd be older
like the Admiral I'm sorry it's so dark
we can't risk being seen it is a bit
romantic though isn't it
do not attempt to house or care for a
friend or family member who shows signs
of course he didn't people are foolish
and believe whatever they're told okay
she's not gonna trust your innocence Oh
will I
log entry wonderful seems we've moved to
a new phase Martin's improvisation
support the former bodyguard has been
freed moved to the staging location
Pendleton's voting bloc and my military
connections all we've lacked is the
ability to reject lethal force in a
controlled manner against a previously
inaccessible to the point we need a man
who can kill the bastards for us
Corvo is more than capable of that when
I prepare this game to Metal Gear not
the earlier metal gears cuz that shit's
linear which is fuck man any items
recovered from doing so are considered
state property
pleased to meet you master Corvo I saw
you at court in happier days but you
might not remember I was once a close
ally to the Lord Regent Hyrum burrows
back when he was just the spymaster
he's one manipulative bastard I can tell
you that there's something distinguished
about you Corvo was their nobility back
in your family line I wouldn't be
surprised
did you know I'm distant kin to the late
Empress in her line not close enough
sadly I'll never be improved see that's
that's our first hint for this guy
that's why I don't trust this guy hun
that is not have the Empress dies his
his plan and share thing to do
he's planning shed me a noble birth
requires a sense of loyalty so I I don't
trust the fuck out of Lord Pendleton no
idea what it's like to suffer Wallis
please breathe two bottles of dunwall
red never mind
which and fetch a clean glass tomorrow
plus he's a skinny white guy called Lord
well this you know what this is a game
with a monarchy and that's that's to be
expected from noble types
tread jump on I can just hold five which
is nice
I think I I think I've looted all the
things you don't know what it means to
work with a man who stood at the
Empress's right hand we can't bring her
back but at least we have the man she
trusted most and maybe we can help you
right some of the wrongs done to you
this bar is mine but please treat it as
your home
Piero still wants a word with you
he's well he's not a diplomat but he's a
brilliant man Samuel is a blessing
without him we couldn't navigate the
waters in here I can't pick it up we
keep our lights low point prying eyes
attention all citizens curfew extends
from sundown to sunrise
unless you're otherwise Onorato
violators will please follow me remember
this this isn't isn't my first time
playing this game I've played through
this section of the game before but I'm
about halfway through the game for my
first time everyone looks sketching in
this game that's the art style which
honestly I think is neat so it's fine
this is your room it was chosen to give
you privacy I understand you'll need
your rest
alright let's continue on with the game
all right
hello cool though your life has taken a
turn has it not the Empress is dead her
precious daughter Emily is lost
somewhere in the city and you will play
a pivotal role in the days to come for
this I have chosen you and drawn you
into the void
I am the outsider and this is my mark
there are forces in the world and beyond
the great forces that we call man this
guy's voice for some reason I hate it in
the second game I believe they recast
this Jessica's newfound power my gift to
you come find me
this how we get magic powers
then this is me at least somewhat
realistic mom sorry steampunk fantasy
world but kind of a neat world
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the days that follow were trials would
be great Corvo seek the ancient runes
bearing my mark in the lonely places of
your world and at shrines raised in my
name these runes will grant you powers
beyond those of other men to help you
find these runes I give you this the
heart of a living thing molded by my
hands with this heart you will hear many
secrets and it will guide you toward my
realness
no matter how they may be hidden listen
to the heart now and find another room
it displays the ended of all things
oh by the way this is the the heart of
the dead Empress your your dead lady
loves heart whispers to you and tells
you things
why's it have gears because steampunk
the more serious of all things creative
salons as a confidence to you
I really need that room that makes your
magic recharge faster
[Music]
when I say that I'm steampunk I don't I
don't know that I am steampunk I've
always liked steampunk how you use what
I have given you falls upon you as it
has to the others before you now I
return you to your world but know that I
will be watching with great interest
we go where we got Bo charms
good lungs find better ones
why somebody bone charms those are the
starter ones those what they give you to
start off with should I clear space for
Samuel then if you like but he won't use
it why he can't sleep in regular beds
anymore or that's what he says says he
was in the Navy too long can you believe
it
oh that pile of wood out there it's a
holy build from an old rowboat where
does Admiral Havelock find these people
I wonder to the heart you can point it
at people
it tells you things about them good day
master carver
Lydia nitrate chores sometimes and I'm
starting to think I never come out ahead
she's a smart one mister below how cute
sound and the Melanesian just says
alright this is why I think Havelock is
going to at least potentially backstab
you at some point this is not a good man
yes yes he has the bloodlust
mad
why is bad someone likes his job I'm
just saying these are hints well let's
get down to it first off I know that
assassination is dark business but
sometimes good men have to do bad things
to make the world right our purpose is
clear we want to restore her Majesty's
line by finding and putting emily
kaldwin on the throne to those ends
we'll hide act in shadow take them apart
piece by piece
well that heart be talking to knives to
the game only when I activated eyes by
your hand it won't be easy he's
protected by his overseers an army of
religious zealots but if anyone can do
it you can your exploits are legendary
Campbell carries a private journal once
you've eliminated him get the journal
because we think it contains Emily's
location recovering hers obviously
critical assuming she's alive that's the
gist of it remember our cause and strike
true we're counting on you
another thing Campbell is holding a
former overseer by the name of Martin
he's one of us and if you manage to find
him give him whatever help you can thank
IKEA master even when he's not working
for our cause it would be good to have
him back here at the house
glad to see you got your rest Corvo
you'll need
it's cousin vital let's get some vital
upgrades we missed
what can I do for you subtitles is the
volume not loud enough for you to hear
the sound I I deliberately wanted it
louder than normal because I know I know
how rich solo streams go alright
breaking my immersion but that's fine
for you for you from a fans anything
from a fans it's it's fine being so dumb
Oh Corvo if you've a moment Corvo hello
I'm Calista I work here for Admiral
Havelock I'm sorry to intrude on your
business but this is important I suspect
you're going to kill the high overseer
that wretched man there's really no
reason for you to listen to me but my
uncle Jeff Kurr now still serves as
captain in the city watch but he's a
good man and my only family the chatter
in servant circles is that Campbell just
took delivery of an exotic poison and I
think I know why my uncle's not
corruptible like the rest of them
Campbell is going to poison my uncle do
you think you could protect him you used
to do that right before you had your
current profession
before you became an assassin
right side missions fun side mission
actually i love that 'extra objective we
got to rescue cornrow it was when i was
when i knew i love this game I'm
supposed to use the heart to track that
here brain and I remember it's that
it'll be super good or pragmatic
pragmatic
[Music]
goddamn fish waste crossbow dart on that
stupid fish take that you fish
[Music]
they eat everything we'll find some more
for it'll be fine
[Music]
ready to go just give the signal I hate
fish when they bite me
my no cam tonight because I'm
