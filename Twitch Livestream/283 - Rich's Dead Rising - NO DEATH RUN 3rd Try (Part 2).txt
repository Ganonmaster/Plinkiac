[A] striker 1 1 2 1 just 
collect your money now
and that's give me the cut Singh oh
that's right a good chance to me
generate the Dark Souls thing I'm fine I
don't need to
we gotta move your bombs that's cheating
Jimmy James is not going to fucking help
my goddamn expound fuckin piece of shit
Xbox
you tennis days are over Carlito you're
finished
Rizzy Xbox they they're not very
sensitive to feelings they're
insensitive this is why they they crash
near the ends of highly successful no
death runs Xboxes don't give no shits
thanks not just that fuck you on the red
ring fuck you
Oh how much you pay for me Oh too bad
that ring fish that's that's an Xbox
they're highly insensitive
Frank took care of the house that the
bombs over and done with Brad went after
Carlito copy
I want to get the the key to the
underground that's in this room back
here
so I do have reason to come over here
bread
if you're waiting around to see if I'm
gonna pull off the run and you want to
be doing something else it's gonna be a
little while we got some we got some
hours left to go I fully understand if
it's getting late you want to leave are
you hurt
we're gonna be around probably go 2 a.m.
I'm coming over there Brad we'll go back
together if you're hurt we'll patch you
up
Jack this is my xbox I know you want to
make videos smashing it up freezes again
xbox if we do that it's the only way I
can play this game Dead Rising is why I
put up 360 even though I'm already dead
I take care of some business while this
is ranked actually there's only one new
one okay
sex weirdo thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it
don't tell Jessie this
how come Dead Rising woman hasn't gotten
a pork when the others have I've heard
and I don't know if it's true because
I've heard I've heard the opposite -
I've heard conflicting reports that the
engine they used for Dead Rising 1 was
some kind of weird weird Japanese engine
that was difficult to port stuff over to
windows huh that's what I've heard I've
also heard people say no that's not true
so I don't I don't know I don't know
I'm gone the wrong way sorry
yeah that's why I wanted I want to turn
around
this up knowing if it is save I'm going
to I'm actually headed
excuse me the saving place for sales
plushie patch thank you for subscribing
we really appreciate it
that makes some quick step and by then
ought to be about time to start the
final leg of 72-hour mode here
is that more so they do anymore either
inventory just got a lot lighter
back to the under safehouse
Oh
okay
I understand yes we have talked about
Mad Max already it's fucking awesome the
conclusion we all came to was you need
to stop what you're doing and watch Mad
Max immediately if not sooner
preferably sooner because that movie
needs to make money okay so they make
more kick-ass brutal our rate in action
movies with practical effects as soon as
Brad gets his hands on that terrorist I
guess it'll be case closed huh
you know of anything else he could be
planning no nothing but the bombs
he's got his computer hidden away I'm
sure there's plenty of information on it
can you take me there to his hideout
leave it to me
Viji dentists you could argue that
you're late or you could argue that
you're right back to where we were when
the last one glitched out on me mister
mister peres sir you said it shipment
called

I don't forgot to say oh well no time no
no time now we're racing the clock
racing the clock
always shit I beat the the the bet I
made for the bathroom before they take
the bathroom good load
wait a minute I'm missing something here
worse the whores in the door
started it down
third
that's not great I've got time to chase
that up so deal with it
dad dad did it all right
right know exactly where I'm going
that guy I mean that meets this is good
neat huh
I just got it in here it's fresh you
just wait right there sure
in a moment you can try the best ground
meat you've ever tasted
whoa whoa wait a minute listen I had
something else in mind
zombies I know good I can't see my
customers spoiled meat like that I have
a reputation to uphold
technically Frank's been here three days
but the zombie outbreaks been going on
for longer than that what's going on
before Frank West shows up at the mall
you got me to give you a friend to shout
out huh sure hey Carl you cool bro
you're finished it's over
what about Isabella yes I know I know
the the mini chainsaws are overpowered
she's on ours
I feel cheap using them but it's all for
the sake of doing a no deaf computer
right now to get revenge for what you
people did to sandbag Alisa to my
hometown
why why was her meat so much more
important to you than human life why why
did my people have to die to feed your
fat bellies that doesn't excuse what
you've done
but I promise the Santa cabeza story
will be told but I need the password
hey hey hey stay with me
give me the computers password are
zombies great I mean all they do is eat
and eat and eat Americans are in dollars
did you know Americans are too bad you
good
it's not over
yes
speak speak damnit what do you mean it's
not over
I'm sorry Isabelle
give this to my sister
Hey
yes
right
perfect
all rights or anything to eat in here
that's a terrible on health but better
safe than sorry
all right
right time to fucking around
earlier we get on the ship the putter
oh whoops
not really
yeah just gonna wait this one out
so I don't know how to feel about that
that fucking Xbox fries bullshit
it's soiled my no death run if I took my
no death from and the Xbox pulled down
its pants and just pissed all over it
I know there are points to be had but
I'm gonna have plenty of time to kill
after the next couple missions plenty of
time to kill will be fine I save in here
I can
he's dead
Oh
so you're saying unless I die in-game an
assistant crash is still a no death run
but you have failed to do was a
single-segment no depth one yeah I know
it would feel so much better if it were
singles like we know do damn it just
looks good there's my best dead rising
run ever he died without telling me a
damn which is why I'm gonna die in LA at
the end the very end I know it you know
I thought he was terrorist scum
in the end all he really cared about was
his sister
jerk
here
he wanted you to have this
yes the game froze while back I've been
saving this time though so we started
nearby froze right before right after
finishing the the bomb run
hmm ah
did you figure it out
yo mama
although earth
our parents said that a lot
the place we live
Senta cabeza
blessed with nature
please believe me when I say my brother
didn't want all this he
even Peace Center cookies
you know now I'm worried it's going to
freeze while I'm saving and ruin the
safe
the emergency lines been freed up hang
on I have never even played dead right
now recently very recently a someone
wanted one of you guys very generously
gifted me a copy of Dead Rising 3 I
haven't gotten around to playing it yet
I kind of want to play through the whole
series so after this I don't know I
don't know if I'm gonna stream it if I
do stream it it won't be a no death run
and then I'm gonna play through Dead
Rising 2 and then and then and then and
then

[C] then I will get around to sleep
Frank it's over h qs decided to Dead
Rising 2 will not be Sunday I got other
plans reject the contacted headquarters
the government has decided to deny all
knowledge of what happened here Special
Forces I know I don't regular Dead
Rising it too is is the cannon dead
rising 2 but the Hoff the record has
Frank West so everyone there's that
I'm not sure which one I'll play the way
I have both do I want Canada do I want
Frank was probably Frank was but I'm not
convinced about hundred percent
tiny turnip have a have a nice nap sleep
well thank you for showing up anybody
else it feels like taking a nap week
when you got a chunk of game left so if
you want to go it smells as good a time
as any I completely understand grab
those flashlights this dark comically
comically dark
all right Jack good night thanks for
thanks for chat with everybody making
this silent nearly silent stream a bit
more exciting
we're damn near at the end of it love
stories
Jessica McCarney
talk about your close calls you
contacted us just in time
your boss thought we should ever talk
with you before the operation begins
we'll be taking you into custody if you
sign an agreement to keep your mouth
shut about all this you'll be free to go
it's kind of tragic Jesse and Brad are
the reason you can't save everybody with
the true ending hey whatever they want
to call it
did she ever get bitten it's possible a
lot Barnaby did something Jessie I don't
think even necessarily have to get bit
in this universe just like I'm assuming
like a wasp sting might do it
yeah there is a way to save Jesse and
Brad you just can't get the good ending
you have to get one of the lesser
endings
you stun basically just stop the story
before they die in the story
what the fuck
so Otis Otis abandoned us into the ball
fuckin Otis and he took everyone else
with him I just
what so now I'm gonna run for a while
what what time's the next thing happened
right actually doesn't say all right
they've all technically I'm done but I
know there's one more thing I can do I
need to do to get the ultimate good true
whatever final bestest amazing amazement
wonderment ending but yeah we got we got
time to fuck around here actually I'm
gonna while I'm in the safe room I'm
gonna go to back I'm just gonna love
this run for it I'm gonna go to the
bathroom
hmm
ok I'm back so how are we doing that is
a nice word
that's the thorn I got from killing the
Colt guy it's still still lasting it's a
good Thorg alright let's go let's go
play around in this mall technically I
could I could just hang out in the safe
room for 12 hours game time and
accomplish most of my goals but we're
not gonna do that that's not funny we're
gonna try to play around in this zombie
fun house
save yeah yeah that's a good point I'll
save
we couldn't we couldn't track down
stickers take pictures of stuff it would
be hilariously tragic if I died while
fucking around but you want the rest of
the stream to be just this sitting here
like this
well don't something yeah bout
definitely first thing I'm doing is
we're going to the orange juice store
and we're gonna make some help I'm going
to try to get the level 50 I don't know
if that's possible
like mathematically I'm not sure if I
can but well I'll I'll do my best
actually waiting around in this room
while I went to the bathroom probably
didn't help the cause
but whatever fuck it
you
did I show you guys a shower head shower
heads great actually know what taking
the elevator down might not be quicker
I'm not a goose there but no big deal no
big deal we've managed to do everything
so it didn't hurt me
what what's this why what's going on
what could this be
all right now those guys they're gonna
be how I attempt to live it off you get
something like 5,000 prestige points a
kill so if I'm gonna do it it's gonna be
by killing Special Forces assholes I'm
gonna try not to die
as greater numbers than I can handle
with a dime
let's find some Special Forces assholes
well we're almost leveled good 247
let's make our way to get a new chainsaw
chainsaw will be a lot of help chief but
we're in don't die mode
nice little checkup that's a good one
what are my what are my stats life throw
distance little Luke gotta get that
throw those things up sorry say to me
you fucking zombie
hopi chainsaw
first of all chainsaw that's that's its
name Opie
there's more guys to kill
lie down there
yeah I was Dead Rising 2 & 3 2 is okay
it's so much easier I don't enjoy it as
much
three people say it's bad I haven't
played it it's recently been notice oh
oh
I don't think I like court much
I just had a thought oh so do something
I forgot what I was gonna do something I
wanted to get that would help make
things easier not what you do they're
gonna get a book I clean forgot
oh I what I was gonna get down oh I
forgot about that where we're taking the
long way we're not fucking with that
shit
barge open space and that I get boys to
fight here moving on
avoid the park
there we go that helps so uh that's
that's our life now work till when
Special Forces guys and killing Special
Forces guys how do we get rid of my boys
except limited usefulness on Thursday
well don't make them like they used to
I could sword the SWAT guys but they're
dangerous I'm not fuckin around with the
SWAT guys
hmm
hmm
that'll be some spot got a fucking or
somewhere vodkas here somewhere
Papa's here somewhere vodkas here
somewhere

[D] 

[E] it's a and the other sound 8 no I don't
want something
all right you can hit up that last oven
and then that's it
this
get up
not bad at all
Saur keeps on rocking
yeah
well missing big chainsaw
I think I think I'm guaranteed 40 at
this point I'm pretty sure I get points
back there the story's over which should
be enough
level max we did it
this is the most amazing dead rising run
this ever happening in the history of
ever
what's it my own fun hardly there yeah
now I just have to not die
in the water
horses new are running nice
now comes over Chainsaw died
almost there
Oh noble effort don't fucking you savvy
Miss America there is never got to show
you guys this thing
there are no special forces guys which I
guess is not a shot but
watch this
almost it we're almost there
fail
I'm gonna save I'm gonna save
whoa
look even if I don't get to the
helicopter I'll get an ending and and
technically it will have been a no death
run so
perfect
yeah for people asking I made a new
profile which was a good thing I did
because we did have another xbox freeze
issue because the Xbox is a decrepit
piece of shit
perfect
yeah
SWAT killed all of the zombies now I
have nothing to do but get to the
helicopter tried to take Isabella with
me she wouldn't come easy would have
nothing to do with this her loss
with their more than a little time to
spare oh my god
I think I'm going to take another
bathroom run oh wow
all right do the Xbox meltdown huh
almost there
less than an in-game hour cool zombie
walk yeah I think I can manage zombie
walk
this is what you get for top of the
highest level
don't don't spoil things chat don't
spoil things
who never played around with the zombie
walk much it's kind of amusing I I love
the look on his face
yes it makes the zombies think you're
one of them it's mostly an easter egg
it's really it's it's kind of completely
useless because if you're rescuing
people you can't walk this slow plus the
zombies would attack the survivors it
who aren't you anyway but it's fun this
game is all about having fun
am I going to watch the Hawks tomorrow
I'm probably gonna be here streaming
if they if they get to the Stanley Cup
Finals I'll make sure I watch those
games but we'll see
yeah there we go
enjoy people
Oh games out of two
well I'll be damned
he's still alive that son of a bitch
mating that must mean he got his scoop I
can't wait to get my share of the take
whoa yeah
all right you just hang tight buddy I'm
on my way
now I'm sure what has figured out what
overtime mode is by now but if there
were an overtime mode would not that
have been the fucking perfect ending to
a zombie movie I mean just absolutely
perfect
and I'm totally doing overtime Oh
I'm happy enough with the way this game
went tonight even if I'm not successful
with overtime I got I did get an ending
and I didn't die
so good
you think wrong let me tell you
you know you don't agree that's the
perfect zombie movie ending I think the
classic Romero zombie movies are
horribly depressing I mean the first one
ends with the what's-his-face getting
shot people by the human beings the
second one ends with them taking off in
a helicopter that's almost out of fuel
and they have no idea what the fuck
they're going to do classically a zombie
movies a dark endings
anybody who wants to leave now we can
officially say I have done a no death
London so nope no shame in leaving now
but I'm gonna keep playing until I get
to the end end or that possibly go
yeah cos bright on the rich 11 guitar of
death a plot to kill themselves
our branch says visible ending but manic
glory ending performer there's more
how long is overtime mode over time mode
can bear can vary there there's still a
timer but you can finish overtime mode
before the timer actually you need to if
you don't finish overtime mode before
the timer you die so over to my mode as
is as long as it takes me to finish
overtime bone
look at that look at that this is great
fucking great
helicopter there are over 50 survivors
but by completing story mode some
characters die
good night John kilo or if you're saying
goodnight to somebody else good night to
that person
I have my reason for not saving there I
will be saying thank God it wasn't easy
getting you back here by myself you know
you collapsed on the roof I collapsed
no I wait
does that mean

[F]

[G] that's my seller freak out we may
actually read ring before this is over
so this drug that stops the parasite
growth
have you ever made it before or is it
just a theory when I was working in the
medical lab my brother asked me to
research a method of suppressing a
parasite of course back then we didn't
extract the hormones directly we
synthesized them in the lab so he was
looking to protect himself from his own
terrorist scheme he wanted a way out is
that it I don't know I know he didn't
bring the drug with him here I have no
idea what he intended to use it for you
think I'm just making excuses but
Carlito kept things from me
even if this
even if you do manage to make this drug
it won't completely cure me will it I'm
afraid not when the effect wears off the
parasite will develop as it normally
would
continuing the zombification process
that lot of good that does me
well
it's the only hope I've got now huh
this is all I need as far as supplies
are concerned now all we need are some
Queens yeah listen
just how long do you suppose your drug
will prevent me from turning into a
walking corpse during my research which
I was never able to conduct proper
clinical studies
to a certain extent the period of
effectiveness depends on each patients
physiology
yeah maybe only a week there's no way to
tell for sure fantastic so I'll be a
walking zombie time bomb a time bomb
what
once the drugs development was complete
Carlito poured his energy to starting an
NPO dedicated to helping war orphans we
had 50 doses of the drug prepared not
long after that the NPO managed to find
homes for a large group of children went
against just how many
god
you saying he infected these kids and
then gave them your drug and he made 50
little ticking time bombs don't know
just don't know it's possible
nor see la these kids are spread all
over the country your theory is right
the entire country could be crawling
with zombies by now
I don't know what's worse
that we don't know for sure that we
can't warn anyone about this
well what we need to do right now is
prepare the hormone and get you taken
care of
boss how to get the generator
I hope stretch go stretch
that's not the worst possible moment my
chainsaw is gonna give out it just knows
it in my blood
goodnight Krieger goodnight anybody
nobody is obligated to stay I know this
is a long-ass stream I know a no death
run is longer than I even thought it
would be
just a helicopter crash
now anybody could stay I'm just saying
you know I feel obligated
no I will not be in the half of the bag
of Mad Max review my review though go
see it
Mad Max fucking awesome
damn it even if this thing leads out of
here I doubt these zombies would just
let us walk right through
oh don't forget the generator come all
this way and forget the generator itself
I ate that helicopter the zombie walk
won't help me with the helicopter coming
plus I've got to get a bunch of Queens
and get all this shit back to Isabella
before time is up
I am stockpiling Queen says hello
Isabella's gonna need them to make the
cure or B not to cure the what do you
call it it's not even a vaccination
either he did delay she's gonna need it
to make the delay the suppressant
all right halfway there but the Queens
for more
points
No
anymore
now the Sun bathe the reason I'm
throwing that away is that attract
zombies to you it's useful when you're
escorting survivors less so or any other
time
looking for the Queens
fuck off
goodbye flashlight
so one more
oh yeah
one near there
just in case this triggers a cutscene
I'm gonna go grab some weapons pieces
triggers something I can't come back
from
I don't think we'll but
so my quest I don't need a damn what
this
ah yeah
we're almost there
almost there
you're gonna inject me with that huh
okay doc
let's get this over with
at least I won't have to worry about
turning into one of them for a while
okay next on the agenda figure out a way
to get the hell out of here when I'm at
the studio my home internet sucks to
identify a pheromone that suppresses the
attack instinct in adult parasites in
other words the zombies don't like the
way it smells if you give me a little
more time I should be able to produce
some of this pheromone they think it
smells bad
you think we could use something like
that to keep them away from us
we could just walk right past them and
get out of here in theory yes
either way it's certainly better than
not it was a cave outside with a
helicopter crashed it was packed with
zombies I mean shoulder-to-shoulder but
it may lead somewhere outside
works
anti-zombie perfume it could keep us
safe in that cave
what you say you ready to get the hell
out of here
there will be enough of this pheromone
to wasted on experiments
we'll only have enough to use at once
whatever you say as far as the the last
boss I have a strategy I'm going to try
I don't know that it's going to work
lead I don't know
considering how many of them keep
pouring out of here it must be connected
to something
Isabella look any other way out of here
is guarded by the military if we're
gonna get out of here and put a stop to
Carlitos plan we've got to go in there
it's the only way it's not like we're
unarmed
we got your smelly perfume don't leave
quick step and mini chainsaw yeah that
will work
you have to fight the last boss
barehanded right they take away your
inventory no weapons no chainsaw no food
