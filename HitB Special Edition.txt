["Half in the Bag" Intro]

Mr. Plinkett [voiceover]: Half in the Bag! "Special Edition"? Who do these guys think they are, George Lucas?

Mike: Hello, and welcome to a special edition of "Half in the Bag". I'm Mike Stoklasa.

Jay: And I'm Jay Bauman.

Mike: And today, we're going to do something a little different. We're going to review a short video that, uh, Jay discovered on the internet recently.

Jay: Yeah, it's essentially a parody of a real movie trailer, and it's done so brilliantly, you, you can't even tell the difference at all.

Mike: Right, it's made to look like some by-the-numbers, big studio, piece-of-shit movie, but it's done so perfectly.

Jay: Yeah, I can, I can see this fooling a lot of people because of how well it's done. But, uh, anyway I guess we should show people what we're talking about. This is the fake trailer for a movie called "The Zookeeper".

[Trailer from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: Oh...wow. That's amazing. Do you know who made that? 

Jay: I, I...no idea, but what's really impressive about is the fact that they seem to have gotten the real Kevin James to be in it.

Mike: Yeah, or a really good look-alike.

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: So they made this trailer look like a bunch of people just got together and said, "We need to plug in all the appropriate elements into a movie to make dumb people go see it in droves."

Jay: Yeah, the cliches in it are so laughably bad, but it's so close to reality, it's right on the line there. I could see this being an actual movie, sadly.

Mike: For me, it goes a little too far in the stupid department. 

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Jay: They did hit all the right marks, though.

Mike: Yes, yes.

Jay: I can see this being a movie that tons of fat idiot retards just flock to and enjoy.

Mike: There's a lot of them out there. 

Jay: Like, you've got the the lovable schlubby guy with a woman that's way out of his league. You've got talking animals, for no apparent reason. It's got really awful, unfunny, physical comedy. Like, it, it just hits all those notes.

Mike: It even has that, like, obvious boyfriend character that's going to be the competition. He's like, you know...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: It's like, by the numbers. 

Jay: It's perfect, yeah.

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: Um, cliches aside, there's, there's some general dumbness in the trailer.

Jay: "Some"?

Mike: Well, there's, there's one part that stuck out, where Kevin James is being taught how to release his inner bear.

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: And, there's apparently no jokes in that scene. It's just him growling and going [Mike makes a roaring noise]. It's so horrible. I mean, if, if this were a real movie, it would be so embarrassing for anyone involved.

Jay: Right. I don't even think that Kevin James would be in a movie this bad...

Mike: No.

Jay: ...in real life.

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: Like, it, it comes off, like, one of those movies, like, late in someone's career, like, I'm just desperate for money...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...kind of thing. And, anyone who's an actor with any kind of integrity would not star in this film.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: Unless they're just a horrible sellout. Um, and I don't know that much about Kevin James. I know he was in "Paul Blart: Mall Cop", and...

Jay: That says it all, doesn't it?

Mike: So, yeah.

Jay: It, it, well, it's kind of nice that he's able to poke fun at that image by doing this...

Mike: Yeah, yeah.

Jay: ...this parody trailer.

Mike: I think it really is him in the trailer.

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: Yeah, maybe he did it on the weekend, and they thought it was, like, a funny thing, and he was poking fun at himself.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: Like, "This is a movie I could potentially star in."

Jay: Right. "I never would, so..."

Mike: Yeah, yeah.

Jay: "...but I have enough of a sense of humor about the dumb movies I've made, that..."

Mike: Right.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: Exactly.

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: There's also a brilliant product placement gag in this trailer.

Jay: Yeah, yeah. All those those real Adam Sandler movies have some sort of whorish product tie-in, and with, like, a restaurant chain or some sort product. So, the fact that they included that in this is like perfect.

Mike: Yeah, yeah. There's a, there's a talking gorilla in the movie, and for no apparent reason he says he loves TGI Fridays, ort that he wants to go to TGI Fridays.

Jay: Yeah.

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: And, uh, and then it, and then later on he goes to TGI Fridays, and, and that's the joke. 

Jay: Well, he goes, he sees the TGI Fridays, and he goes, "Shut...up."

Mike: Like, yeah.

Jay: Like in awe.

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Jay: I'm picturing, like, retarded people in the theatre just laughing hysterically cuz they've heard of TGI Fridays.

Mike: Yeah. And, and the fact that, that a gorilla wants to go there.

Jay: That's also the scene where the gorilla is in the car dancing to that hip-hop song that was popular like three years ago. 

Mike: Yes, yes. The apple bottom jeans song. 

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: It's always like a dated song, slightly dated.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And, and it's perfect. The "apple bottom jeans" song is perfect. And one thing it was missing is, they really should have had one of the animals log into his myspace account, just to make it, just, perfectly dated.

Jay: Yeah. I, I was a little disappointed that the, the fake trailer didn't have either a fart joke or, like, a kick to the crotch.

Mike: Yeah. Right.

Jay: It was also missing, like, a whacky sidekick, like a zookeeper sidekick character to Kevin James, played by, like, I don't know, like, Justin Long.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: Or like a rapper. Like, that would have been, that would have been perfect.

Mike: Yeah. Well, in order for the gag to work, though, you probably would have had to get the real actor, you know, so maybe they couldn't--

Jay: Maybe they couldn't get somebody.

Mike: Maybe it was just a thing where, whoever made this new Kevin James...and had him for a weekend, or something like that... 

Jay: Yeah. 

Mike: ...you know, so, like, it would have been perfect to have, like Ludacris, in there, or, you know, someone like that.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: As the whacky...

Jay: Wisecracking sidekick.

Mike: Wisecracking sidekick, who, who you wouldn't think "Works in a zoo..."

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: "...but he does!"

Mike: And they even got the font right.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: You know, the shiny, semi-reflective, embossed, pastel-colored, 3D, soft, beveled font. The kind that looks like candy, it just makes you want to eat it.

[Scene from "The Zookeeper" plays]

Mike: So, Jay, how does this fake trailer compare to other recent fake trailers?

Jay: Like, what? 

Mike: You know, uh, "Old Dogs"...

[Scene from "Old Dogs" plays] 

Mike: ...mm, "Grownups"...

[Scene from "Grownups" plays] 

Mike: ..."Furry Vengeance"...

[Scene from "Furry Vengeance" plays]

Jay: Mike, those were real movies.

Mike: What?

[House phone rings. Mike picks it up.]

Mike: Yes? Thank you. 

[He hangs up the phone, and turns to Jay] 

Mike: "The zookeeper"...is a real movie. 

[Mike cocks a loaded shotgun]

Mike: I'll go first.
