_____________________________

Woman's voice: The hell just happened?

Jay: I don't know. That was bizarre.

Woman's voice: I totally just hit record. That's all I hit.

Jay: Is it recording?

Woman's voice: Yeah.

[Intro: FAST FORWARD VIDEO and BLANC SCREEN CINEMA present "monkey make movie"]

[Episode 1: George Lucas sucks]

Jay: Hey, boys and girls! Welcome to the first episode of "monkey make movie"! You're, uh, bi-weekly installment of instructions on, you know, anything low-budget-film-related.

[Under his breath, Jay says, "God, I suck."]

Jay: I'm your host, Jay Bauman, and of Blanc Screen Cinema! And, uh, I'd like to take, uh, this opportunity on our first episode to introduce my assistant. This, uh, is Bingo.

[A woman around Jay's age awkwardly shuffles towards the camera]

Jay: Get in here.

[He motions her to hurry up]

Jay: Faster. Faster.

[Cut to a close-up of Bingo, who is holding out her bottom lip toward the camera]

Jay: Bingo hails from Rockford, Illinois. Bingo, uh, tell people about yourself.

Bingo: My name is Bingo, and I'm from Rockford. Auuuuughhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Jay: Bingo, you're not speaking words anymore. What have I told you about that? Are you--

Bingo: My gums are bleeding!

[Bingo purses and rotates her gums in several directions]

Jay: What? How did that happen?

Bingo: I got into a barfight. Bar won.

[Jay curls his mouth in horror]

Jay: Okay, well...Bingo, it's funny you should mention blood, actually, because that's what we're gonna be discussing on our first episode. Uh, the, the proper recipe for how to make really good quality fake blood. Uh, anyone familiar with Blanc Screen Cinema and our films knows that we love comically gratuitous violence.

[Various scenes play from Jay's earlier films]

Jay: So, yeah, I have...uh, I actually wrote the recipe on the back of my rent check envelope. I didn't have anything else to, whatever. Okay, here are the items you'll need: six pints of Karo syrup. We couldn't afford any Karo syrup. Uh, we had to go through the kitchen. Just pretend that the, this ranch dressing is Karo syrup for the time being. Use real Karo syrup. Ranch dressing isn't the proper substitute. Uh, three pints of red food coloring.

Bingo: Three pints!

[Bingo is holding up four fingers]

Jay: How many?

[Bingo mouths for the correct answer]

Bingo: Three?

Jay: Yes.

Bingo: Three pints.

[Bingo is still holding up four fingers]

Jay: Uh, we didn't have any red food coloring, so we're going to use this, this Pepsi instead.

[Jay takes a swig from a 20-oz bottle of Pepsi]

Jay: I don't even know whose this is, I don't know where it came from. Uh, one pint of non-dairy creamer. 

[Close-up of Jay holding a single serving of Ramen noodles]

Jay: Pretend these Ramen noodles are non-dairy creamer. 

[Bingo is in her own world, playing with her hair]

Jay: And one drop of blue food coloring, which I'm not even gonna bother to try and substitute. Uh, so, first, to get started, you're going to want to pour your Karo syrup into a mixing bowl.

Bingo: Yup!

Jay: We didn't have a mixing bowl, uh...

[Camera jump cuts forward]

Jay: Bingo broke the mixing bowl--

Bingo: I did.

Jay: --so we're gonna use a strainer, you know...demonstration purposes. Uh, do you wanna open up the Karo syrup, please?

Bingo: Okay.

[Bingo struggles to open up the Karo syrup]

Jay: And while you're...add the syrup, and the, uh...

[Close-up of Bingo's cleavage as she struggles]

Jay: Bingo.

Bingo: What, it's stuck!

Jay: No, Bingo, this is--

Bingo: What?

Jay: This is, we're trying to be informative here. It's really distracting. Could you cover yourself?

[Bingo nods, and puts a paper bag over her head]

Jay: There. And, in a separate bowl, you're gonna wanna mix your non-dairy creamer, uh, mix it up with a spoon, or something, until it gets fluffy, and kind of a, kind of a pasty consistency. And then, you're gonna take that paste, and, and slowly fold into the, uh, Karo syrup. 

[Jay drops the packet of Ramen noodles in the strainer, next to the Ranch dressing]

Jay: And then you're gonna wanna take your food coloring, and, and pour that in.

[Jay takes another drink of Pepsi]

[Bingo starts wandering off set]

Jay: You know, the uh, the real truth is, you know, no matter how much your blood to make it look good, people aren't gonna care. It's like, you know, you can cover an entire kitchen, and all these actors, in fucking fake blood, and people are just gonna complain that it's poorly shot, or the actors suck. They're not gonna care about all the hard work you put into decent-looking blood. They're not gonna care about that.

[Jay raises his fist, and pounds it into his leg, repeatedly]

Jay: Ow! Ow! 

[Bingo lifts the bag off of her head]

Bingo: Is it over?

Jay: It's over, go away. 

[Jay keeps hitting himself]

Jay: Ow! Aagh, Jesus!

[the end]
