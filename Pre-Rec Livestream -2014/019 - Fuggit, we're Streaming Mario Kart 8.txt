issues today was supposed to be the day
that we were going to record all of the
gameplay footage for our Nets prereq
episode of Mario Kart 8 and I had a hard
drive failure and we lost a couple hours
worth of really good footage all of the
footage that like the first time playing
it Rich's first time playing J was here
playing the games we created knees we
created knees for rich and J and it was
a really fun time and the hard drive
crashed and we lost some footage and we
felt really sad and so we said fuck it

figured there might be something

100cc now Ritchie's game man you are 100
for sure he's might even unfasten what
because I won you may be a Mario Kart
expert that doesn't mean I'm horrible
I am very expert that Jack is currently
obsessed with this game I've played a
lot of mario kart thank you you didn't
win every year yes junkie though there
will still be a stream on Friday oh yeah
yeah we're not cancelling that this is
just this is I felt like it yeah we felt
like it this is a bonus stream there

there
all right I'm gonna be I wouldn't be my
me go we got a new part yep oh the
sports cool the front yes this is
depression stream yeah that's an
accurate assessment situation silver
tone Sonic the Hedgehog is not a good
game we have a whole video describing
why it's not if it were just us shitting
on it and laughing yeah I'd be one thing
but we've brought up points and we
talked about why we felt the way we do
mm-hmm
so I think our criticisms are valid you
know there's still opinions sure I think
I'm gonna be the sports coupe it seems
super nice top speed here
at the standard you wanted my bonus I
got I got values here of my values yes
well you know I'm a bald man with
glasses everything looks like Moby let's
go for one that doesn't have the three
stars because then everyone see you see
down bottom by some of them have the
three right now I'm trying to go one all
right 100% Mario Kart
oh I'm sorry if you were trying to watch
sharknado 2
why would you go watch sharknado 2 I
don't know catch up with a stream later
yeah this will hey I know how long we're
gonna go tonight this might not be
what's this we're starting late summer I
believe I might go so I get I have to
drink beer and then sober oh we need to
pause it right away and change motion
fun I don't like it okay
all right here we go off to the races
you're the one that's you yeah yeah out
here with this Jam we okay so jack is on
the right
riches on the Left riches Murray riches
Mario Jack is the blue helmet oh my god
this is significantly harder with the
wing
all power slides Jack is a power slide
expert I can Tokyo Drift this is all I'm
saying oh my god did you give your enemy
rapport no that's coming out talk you're
drifting to the s Tokyo Drift right into
your s hi here we go oh you're Mario
yeah Mary hey guess what boom power
slide
you can't can't dig on this
rich is still figuring out how to power
slide and I've discovered I was trying
to like we played with with rich in with
jr. and I realized like explaining it to
someone or trying to verbally explain
how to power slide it's a really
difficult test so I'm hoping that he can
just kind of watching
until then I'm just gonna win I'm gonna
beat it you really likes being a jerk I
do I'm sorry okay Jam
welcome to the jam yeah this is the slam
hey okay okay
banana watch out for bananas by the way
that's all mario kart is is watch out
for bananas I do almost wish there was
an auto gas button never I die I cannot
think of a time once in the game that
I've taken my thumb off of the gas pedal
just like why not just make that boom oh
thank me first place someone is asking
whether or not I enjoy the gamepad don't
you and I do it's a little I mean it's
different is is the real thing and it's
surprisingly comfortable to hold in your
life didn't ya like it's it's you know
and what like you find yourself when you
game you kind of just like rest it on
your legs and it's it's really nice in
your than on your lap I can't imagine
like
like a sugar bank comfortable with a bun
way out I don't know yeah I'm using the
stick and the butter seems it might be
switching between the two shoulder
buttons is awkward they want you to use
your index and your middle finger which
is just a terrible idea
yeah the two shoulder buttons are really
far apart yeah but I've never been in a
situation in which I need to use them
both rapid succession
so I remember once it's too so here's a
Mario Kart pro tip when you see the
letter to when they're counting down to
three two one that's when you press on
the gas pedal that's what gives you the
speed on the last come on the tube now
you start moving up on the tooth
also I am thinking about going pro I
don't know if you guys just saw that
promo vessel again just talk wrench you
can hold bananas behind you
when someone shoots a red shell at you
to block cut you and green chose to not
just block to cut nothing whoever's
behind me God
all right hey you have those let's let's
you know sometimes you get caught
sometimes you get caught you know bring
your bad luck some place aren't that
yeah
whoever's behind me is getting all the
red shells
check this out jump in the Yale company
every jumps is super cute
here's what you should know about Jack
he's super granamyr I'm in first place
Oh did you just throw glue shot at me it
doesn't matter I'm so far in front it
doesn't even super jerk disguised as
many plays Mario Kart Oh actually and by
the way there was someone right next to
me hit them too I'm great
I am a jerk I'm really sorry but also
I promise
my future right back I also just kind of
think it's fun
I'm being extra a jerk because so yes
I'm blaming this tree
yes MLG Pro Mario Kart are we gonna do
we just get a sub tell me so this this
shit
yes hero of Leon hero of Lenin no hero
of lemon thank you for subscribing we
appreciate that have a pizza roll jack
is really very tiny touch
we weren't we're not necessarily set up
or streaming yeah and so I don't have my
nice microphone I don't have my extra
monitor and so I probably sound like I'm
sitting your furthest away yeah so if
anything sounds or it looks funny
tonight okay that is the moral of the
story this is really tough the Wiimote I
might I might move to the back control
so when you see that - that's right
and then for every jump is another
mariokart pro tip every single jump you
hit that jump button dump button which
is the power slide button which is what
I'm doing right now every single jump
you hit that button and it gives you a
little boost on our side power slide no
this is pink taking pink
to Jim Jim Jim
I went too fast don't go fast
ah
but be ok with it
and God probably oh that was it so one
of the new items they added to mark our
date was that item I just had which is a
red box with a little yellow it's like a
big noise maker and it is the first ever
defense against the blue shell and what
I mean by that is like you know if you
had a star or something you could defend
yourself against the blue shell but
never gonna starve you that is an item
that you get first place and it defends
against
Oh powers like
next week a new mark
who that who that noise
who saves hours life
go get that power slide down stick with
pink offer who's that yeah
it's game is all about power signing
Tokyo driftin if you know what I mean
up in here r.i.p Walker everyone stop
listening today strange man this is her
jerk this is very true sometimes Dec
just talks no particulars
turn are you
yeah okay I just plugged in I have the
whatever this is the classic controller
this'll do me oh I don't
sure yeah Jack is extra silly tonight
that is very true
that was horribly depressed
it depresses me when computers don't
work it really does because they're
supposed to we only lost the game plays
oh that's right we still have us all of
our talking
okay we're gonna how to play the game
again new control
oh yeah
yeah it's their power slang
that fire sign into the coins into the
boost into the boost and a jump off the
boost everybody's everybody's impressed
you know who's most impressed it's jack
nobody's born personally that means
stupid power drift you still not getting
the partner really guys suck at racing
games weren't only my bag
yeah yeah okay sir it's not for everyone
it is not forever
Oh fun will appear for these Oh in case
you guys haven't figured it out only
because
I have always and forever been a huge
fan of lots of memories
- would you move would you hit that jump
on it if that jump up when you go after
jumps get a little boost
now it's 9-9 a power slide power slide
check us out at mobile it's blue city
just boost off of everything yeah
boom City baby you keep it put city
population a jack he's talking about how
much I started I'm sure that I have not
checked
well in the victory loading the victory
we got nothing
hmm
fire cart isn't it you know what maybe
it is maybe it's an acquired thing it's
like what is somebody saying oh that's
what someone said Mario garden an
acquired taste
it's like you know this is the kind of
games I would play we'd get together by
mark
what it used to be is right um eight out
of high school
guys
bring such and that this wasn't usually
our test someone who would want to go
home and who would think they were too
drunk to go we played Mario Kart and
depending on how well they drove and
where our cars out we'd let them go well
if anything it stopped them from going
home for like an hour if they were to
whoa three stars
everything's great how are you guys
tonight okay different course choose
different cars we made a rich me too I
mean genic has had one beer tonight and
I'm having another one now really is not
that great stopped you
ears weird that way I'm gonna dig in
this don't worry about it but no my
confidence is not coming from the beer
it's coming from joy of playing Marc
especially with this yeah well you know
this like everything's just
so this gives me a little more
this big honking thing I've got that is
really great it's just the the pad rests
I only been great with the pad is I find
specifically for Mario Kart the on
screen stuff useless it's gonna be about
five games totals of the system that
seriously need this group right
that being said but I would like to try
it clang just on the screen that's what
I'm selling points at the weeds that you
can play the game just the screen
breathe so it's like Oh suck it biggie
Luigi I wonder what it would be like to
play a game like Mario Kart
I have a question which is by the way
another
butt-fuck powerslide yo which is that
fuck that another one of my big gripes
of the system is when you're playing
multiplayer and you want to look at just
the screen it it shows the entire it
shows everybody shows the split-screen
it's like a little shit show me just hey
Veon but what car do you have got this
big thing yeah
slidin might be a wheel selection
those the wheels make a big difference
if you want Jax kind of rocking it
yeah it might sound like it's cutting
out every once in a while we're just
using the UM laptop microphone using
garbage just garbage is what we got we
got we got nothing but garbage this I've
yet to play Meijer garden newer than
double - double - I love double - double
- was really fun
that was the I mean for the you know 30
people who owned a Gamecube Double Dash
was great I don't know what either of
them are the truth the tiny wheels of
the bed I don't know I don't I don't
know well let's find out if anything we
can just do it right
oh yeah did you guys see I can't read it
because it's very tiny but Kotaku linked
to the sonic review and I thought that
was really about some of them so how
many how many people on the thread hey
toes yeah
how many people loves on a guy's job
yeah you obviously I didn't say I hate
son I never said that argument was
overrated
and in fact that you went out of your
way to say that you still enjoys I
started to I didn't get much food no no
it's like when the to is all the way out
like it's not a situation no and I also
made sure to keep that in the editing
you know that we said like you liked it
especially while rocking a Chaos
Emeralds because I knew that was
important
but still you know people just see it
assume both of us hated it even though
it was just me that they could I agree
but I mean yeah as far as like overrated
goes it's just one of those things where
the games are overrated
but Sonic as the embodiment of the Sega
Genesis is very important and I totally
get and agree with that point Genesis
was big competition for Nintendo as a
good system had a lot of fun games Sonic
was the mascot so Sonic does deserve a
place in history now because of those
games I think that's the takeaway
as far as I - if you like the games
though I think that's what us it's the
wheels you want super touch the next the
next horses yeah I'm just gonna pick
both basic standard birthers okay
nothing that's fine I just
I always just choose like stock moves
cuz I have no anyone your 12th place oh
my god oh I just went to 11
oh there you go love it be ready ready
you're doing it
get there get there buddy that I mean
also I ever do apologize like we're both
playing right now so we can really read
the stream of the comments
we're playing but in between matches
I'll make sure to check it
it's not really anyone's free to monitor
the chat right now I don't have magic
guys I can't do this that you know what
actually I just see someone mentioned
Crash Bandicoot I the one really
surprising thing is I've heard a lot of
people defending Crash Bandicoot games
never I can't
that's to me more surprising than Sonic
yeah I understand people liking Naughty
Dog
I understand that sure sure that's
pretty the things they like you like
Jackson Dexter they like oh sure they
like drake's Fortune a glassed of us and
so it's just it's like sorry I can't
have no control I think a car with low
acceleration that I can't control
constantly hitting things and I can't
get up oh yeah and did you know the
golden boy I'm gonna do that okay he's
throwing it there because of your tiny
tiny wheels yeah yeah look at you dating
now this whole game is wrecked because I
forgot to do the initial
what
get that coin so if you guys see us
collecting these coins think or anyone
who doesn't know for anyone who does not
know you can collect up to 10 coins in
Mario Kart 8 and helps your Maximus and
then a little bit of a speed boost oh my
god
apparently I can't drive home ice world
so but the coins are some of the coins
are a little out of the way so
collecting the coins is really important
out of that first lap and try to hold on
to as many as you can
round the rest
and always powers like you guys were
ever thinking about not power-sliding I
would power slam
in a room fun game but we're playing
fucking marketer
beddin deal with it
rich knows how to place we're doing is
once but you start the slide you can
move right or left but you don't turn
yes it's right here
that's how the slide works so it's it's
whether or not you're turning a hard
right or a soft right and once you start
this line and so this is you got a turn
to start the slide but you have to turn
to start to find the slide just guides
you it's it's nothing but intuitive have
you ever driven
have you ever Tokyo drifting no well
okay I Drive with the same even big but
so the first thing you have to do I go
to the store when I come home yeah first
thing you have to do is Tokyo driving it
like when when I was learning how to
drive a car that was one of the very
first things that I was point ochio
drift not so good is is go out in the
snow in an empty parking lot and slide
did you ever do that oh that's what they
say to do is to go out into an empty
parking lot and slide around so you will
know what it's like to slide so then
when if you're in an emergency situation
so maybe this is the problem you've
never Tokyo perfect I'm just gonna keep
going and don't go drifting John kilo
knowin in Mario Kart 8 you do not move
slower on earth there are a ton of water
section yeah there's a ton of underwater
sections and it's really fun
get a little propeller
makes no sense it's perfect sense for
fun we tried holding our breaths
underwater sequences right ah we lost
all of it
No we might have lost all that I'm gonna
try to recover all that's a rawhide
needy gorilla step one
Tokyo Drift step two question mark step
three profit you did it a little too
soon too soon
yeah it's like it's like when you have
to let go no no like you know like the
two kind of like chops up wait until the
two is all the way out okay okay
it's been Marta curtain villa
I got this game not this good this came
on Monday
it's game Monday night I've been playing
this game pretty much since
showed up late to the studio today
playing this game this morning had to
get quick work done in the afternoon
which is my house a little friendly but
also like I've just played every single
Mario Kart that is
I am a Nintendo fanboy I don't think
there's anything wrong with being a
thing well it's like what's the
connotation of family stupid I think sir
I like I think been a fanboy means
surrendering the grain and the Viking
something just because it has the right
oh well I don't like to find sample oh
okay well then I'm not at that I am a
fan of Nintendo Nintendo makes quality
products a lot of the time you also have
the time next time standard things
standard ever standard go to hurt
stamping wheels you need to standard
Mario you need to go standard until you
learn you learn once he wants you to
figure out some stuff then you can send
lesson now learn the rules before you
can break him no I'm saying everybody
yeah
you jump
ah Tokyo Drift past the banana also they
have these sections here like we just
saw where it's like we ain't pass stuff
and I have no idea what the purpose of
that is what that's okay that I can read
the agree to China Sonic 2 is the best
game for Sonic absolutely absolutely
does anyone remember the 90s absolutely
I tied for 11th place Haney
congratulations you have your dear
you're tied for last
oh there's another race
yeah always practice Tokyo drifting
oh well I'm glad that this dream is
sexually arousing
by the - that's so weird well because it
takes your tires
time to rev up past games wasn't it
always thing I think it's I actually
don't remember I want to say it was
different customs yes I think you're
right that's like you have to hit it
like right before or the last signal
goes yeah yeah you might be right and it
might be different for each game I don't
know gentlemen we have a special guest
on cabs in skis here so now it's just me
what's so bhavam hi everybody
Hayes here David Mike send the laptops
away
okay because suppose I could sit in the
chair alone thank you
we're gonna scoot over very tired and
sore now you're talking hello addict can
people hear me yeah I see that
see go
yeah
since we don't have a proper audio setup
I'm not talking sensibly about when
Peaks blu-ray that just came out how
amazing the deleted material is I save
that for another day became an economics
Kudo at brains have shut off so I can
articulate things properly I'm very
tired because I was up all night
watching drink leaks blu-ray stuff yeah
- I've gotten two blue shells yeah this
is following different printing paths
I have gotten to Michelle's Oh No
Eastern tiny Oh
well above Olivia oh that's all I
remember in the n64 version there were a
couple of courses where if you made
people aren't tiny like before a jump
they got like sent back to the startup
yeah
and so you would always like watch your
friends screen and right before they hit
that jump you've hit the lightning bolt
fuck their shit
three times her head my those who won
terrible that's okay it's okay to be
terrible oh yeah a lot of people are
just like saying like I need stuff like
you remember 90's stuff I remember the
night I was oh my hey Dylan this is
someone just the news does anyone
remember Animaniacs he names was the
greatest how old are you that's asking
that guessing you're younger than us
probably maybe you're not old enough to
be nostalgic yet once you are old enough
to be nostalgic he'll understand it's
fun
yeah why are you that's what it was
Mario Stadium 64 had a jump to jumped
over an earlier part of the track which
was also okay like a meat level design
but then if you lightly need someone in
the middle of the jump they would drop
down to the beginning of the crap into
the track it was really funny okay hey
we do it um sure always think we would
you like a spot on the couch yeah yeah
you know what you know what it does okay
we're gonna three raise now all right
we're gonna have a three race hey Larry
um I'll be this guy uh you know the fact
that he's called a shy guy is probably
something I didn't know at one point in
my life is super acceleration
mr. scooty mr. studio super acceleration
what speed they only have like it
anything and super acceleration it had
yeah my acceleration accelerating the
jack-shit if you get like this game you
can get hit with everything and
everything so that's I'm used to just
getting hit with everything that's what
happens to me when I play this I'm
calling it well that's not it's probably
true that it's probably okay y'all so
rich is Mario in the top left Jack is
Luigi in the top eight J shy guy in the
bottom
what is going on oh it was on the wrong
thing
it was on this I think hope that's all
right see what happened yes yes now I
can okay sorry okay here we go you
fixing help
everything's under your personal
I hate everything I just eat everything
better let's do it let's do it cuz
there's so much good enough you should
pick up the new twin peaks' blu-ray you
won't hate it cuz it's great it's got 90
minutes of new material that I have
never seen before
oh my god I don't know where I'm going
there
ah how am I getting worse that's how I
feel when I play these games
it's official it's
ah I tried to tell the owner of deck
video I don't believe in the Tokyo
drifting never works for me you gotta
live in Tokyo Drift it's the only way by
the way I don't know if every just saw
my from me I Major League Gaming Pro
moon is if there's someone second place
kind of behind you
hit the brakes and the blue shell was a
total dick and it's awesome just so
he'll drifted right another wall can't
explain to you how to Tokyo Drift it's
gotta be learning it just learned I just
Tokyo Drift it into the wall again Wow
I don't think it works this is made-up
nonsense wing and you started to Tokyo
Drift you're locked into turning in one
direction yep and then you can either
turn harder
just tell us every single time that's
all I do
it doesn't work just trying to make a
fool out of me it's why it's my mind
game yes you know it's a rich here in
your Mario right yeah yeah better than
you I suck Susan escape bad reviews and
so Ken yeah well you know what rich you
should have raised
that doesn't change any of the problems
with the game you're still the game is
on the rails you can't see what you're
reacting to see what your old so the
thing you don't know is coming Mike
stripe for anyone good no I wants to
understand the joke that was everyone
everyone who criticized rich a nice
critique of Sonic everyone just a resume
which did nothing to diminish all of our
critiques rolling the Matabele sewers
under Mushroom Kingdom
if he doesn't work Tokyo drifting is a
myth hear me now
Tokyo Drift for life all I maybe he
blamed it on my car earlier when I
played but I'm blaming it on it's not
working I'm blaming I know exactly I
undo it exactly what you say to do and
all I do is run into walls I'm blaming
it on my inability to explain to you how
to properly okay okay I I apologize
oh my lord where am I see buddy job
local duty job
do
you didn't
yeah
ah about the stubble it's my favorite
best in the furies doesn't sink supposed
to be good
I don't know fine I think those movies
at this point I've never seen a single
one yeah but what I gather they know
exactly what they are and and they just
try to be as good as they can
yeah how does that goes I'm sure they're
fine what was the latest one six I think
what I heard was that one reached a
point of self-awareness where it was
like they were like meeting with oh no
that's what was that what that was Tork
where they had like a kung fu fight with
motorcycles right and I have no glue
it's a it's fast and furious with
motorcyclists and they have a come to
pass
okay they fight it's like I might swing
them around yes like they swing around
motorcycles one winding
really watch the torque is that a movie
it's a movie I'm in pre-production no
big deal bad boys boy you learn no no
this time I am in 12th place rich
because I'm balding off of everything
huh and hitting every single wall
I've tried I've tried Tokyo drifting and
that's a bunch of bullshit yes it is it
took you I'm driven right into that wall
this particular bike has a lot of really
sharp corner it does that's where Tokyo
drifting really helps cuz like look up
it's not wrong place
yeah how come I'm in first it's like if
this is because apparently you play this
game way too - I got this game on Monday
Harold this is the curb you have to
start Tokyo drifting like here and then
like drift there where do you start it
for the stream or there's no camera
alright if to start drifting way before
the turn
it didn't work but that's okay
okay well then it did work
I know no one's gonna want to be my
friend if I keep Tokyo drifting sorry
Street
this is my problem there forever
problems I run out of people to blame I
wonder why is your ass yeah
like yeah
oh my god everybody's hitting me
everybody has a register it's probably
everybody everybody's got red shell
we have to read Chelsea
there there are a few games that I'm not
allowed to play with my life I cannot
play Smash Brothers with her though she
will kick my ass in any any other 2d
yeah like Marvel vs. Capcom the game in
which she will destroy me and I don't
know why any a sword like Street Fighter
Mortal Kombat any of those types of game
I will get them direct
but for some reason Spanish brothers
like Mario Kart
Beach out of here
this actually is what really excites me
about to be be used as gamepad so I can
play on the gamepad while she watches
directors from Swiss comments on it okay
oh really

is the thing we were all telling each
other to shut off the any bill that
episode where mike tells me to shut up

weirdos someone in the stream sure is
handsome god damn it

same time this is the frustrating part
of this game mm-hmm yeah yeah you son of

what every um no Jack and rich have not
talked about the reception of Masonic
would you like us to talk about the
receivable sonic video I'm assuming they
would cuz everybody hates you guys now
it's pretty true no you know what
actually I've seen that's what I'm also
saying a lot of positive
people are apparently heavily divided on
the sonic this is important it's a 30
year old video game it's apparently an
issue on the on the red letter media
subreddit is a mobius strip that's
awesome
the the sonic episode has the most
amount of comments over anything
subreddit right now people really love
to talk about something whether or not
something is good people are passionate
about the shit they grew up with it's
crazy
yeah oh that's fine I think I think it's
all fine like and as we've said a
gazillion times on this live stream like
whatever you're into man if you want to
like sign a new like Sonic that's fine
I'm not gonna stop you and like in Sonic
but you said that you don't mess and
that means that that's your opinion you
think your opinion expect that's how
that's how people react yes things
exactly who are you to express your
thoughts on this
I'm just semester Jack back yeah I I
really enjoyed the sonic video there
were a few audio issues that I realized
that bored sorry if I brought in our
here's a couple loud but I really like
the sign
I think Regina I got to express our
thoughts very clearly and I appreciate
anyone who enjoys the jokes and who does
not because of an episode about video do
you on some level though appreciate the
people that want to move on somewhere on
some level I would like to it's just
just my shit here what I'm doing right
now your life yeah no it's gonna you're
crazy
down here you know what you are the
mayor of crazytown that's what I'm
saying
we're living in a village full of crazy
crazy
thank you saying we're driving up a wall
I like the fact that this courses of
fucking mobius strip yeah it's beautiful
this is beautiful design the people
talking about samurai cop yes we're
aware he's alive he tried to work
something out and it didn't come
together
unfortunately never never will is
instead yeah okay
unfortunate but whatever if I want to
know anything about what he's been up to
there's a podcast called he's
picturehouse I think is the name of it
rock did like a two hour long interview
with him that gets you up to date on
everything the second part that's
focused solely on samurai first part was
the to our first to our part it's just
his life burn after Santa oh it's a good
listen I highly recommend it
let's already oh yeah
and he does not reference us by name but
if you listen to podcast he explains
that he was talking to the clog a blog
about coming out and doing a cameo in
the film he doesn't mention us by name
which is nice but he's big he's talking
about us and white anything
he didn't know how to upload a video to
youtube so he can call our site a blog
you guys are vloggers right
blow dear blonds to the vlog or a log
for the called bolt right I've always
assumed water long ism oh I'm gonna be
mom yeah no I've never I've never heard
it said be longer for the first period
of time I've heard that
I'm not go the movie enemy yes I've seen
enemy enemy is one of my favorite movies
in the last few years it's fantastic now
there's someone that comments exit enemy
and under the skin or two movies I've
seen recently that no one's making
movies like that right so it's really
exciting especially enemy I like that
it's like two people in the start
now that is legs it's true this no I
mean yeah I know I hear you hear you
0:04 the blues oh yeah yeah
observe that I mean I would feel bad if
I wasn't still in for twice
but we have any other games we can that
we can download again we have the Wii U
here and there you can download games so
that we do you condemn you don't have to
insert the cartridge you're doing sit
suitor character at the blow of the
cartridge first and then put it into the
machine never go into the cartridge use
a q-tip button - so what having you over
the cartridge you don't own the digital
media that's a licensing given the
option I'll always take something up
this movie is a bit paranoid
also there are no spikes in this game
that I know there are some bottomless
things other skeletons that need to be
removed don't lose any skeletons so oh
sorry yes this is Jack versus rich rich
is Mario on the Left Jack is this is the
one that's losing lucky thing on the
right there's the one that fucking sucks
apparently a barrio cover for anyone
just joining the stream i see i saw
someone said they're just joining the
stream
jack is really good at Mario Kart and
rich is learning how to play again
I remember being good at the version I
remember playing races on wine and
winning
okay so it's just you might be out of
practice and that's fine that's fine
I had a couple online matches last night
and enjoy it it was it was really fun
playing with I think the most I had
online I was like there ten other people
it was really fun playing with ten real
challenged you know like no offense to
Nintendo's AI but it ain't the brightest
so yeah playing with that many real
people that's real and like a real
challenge people be bitches I only I
want to say it played like I have games
last night and i won i only won worn
like a min first the rest time it was
like pretty soundly like do you know
like I can do it smart
which is nice
and you can you can tell immediately
they knew what they were doing
which is fine I had like a little
ranking system you know if you come in
here
Mikey Bailey goes up
it seemed to work the only weird thing
but like the good and the bad about you
I know I'm ami that there's no voice
chat you can choose to stay a list of
predetermined phrases so you can say
let's get the game started I hope I do
better next time you know stuff like
that
and so you know everything was quiet and
I felt and you just see everyone else's
movies and so like everyone just seemed
really polite mostly because they
weren't talking and then all these nice
smiling weave means were there and
you're just like oh I kind of do want to
talk to you but then you did yeah they
just be saying awful awful things so
expect
I do also have high broad Albert is the
my regard for the week
sometimes do it sometime
the difference in the feel with handle
little edges yeah I break it off
every day
no Jack and rich rich is on the left
Tech is on the right
I'm just hanging out and JC's hanging
you know some work in the background
someone just the best of the worst it
should be up tomorrow
Oh God pass the word should be out to
Serbia tomorrow assuming there's no
last-minute technical issues
rich is using the gamepad I'm using the
Wii classic controller the Wii classic
controller that you plug in to emote
looks like a real control I tried using
the Wii mode earlier on but not much
care for it which is using the gamepad
overall we kind of like the gamepad has
a nice weight to it and it feels it's
nice when it's kind of resting under all
happening to have different games yeah
that's the thing is we so far we've only
use it with one character oh it's only
yes the awkward super cut is wonderful I
think we say three or four more times
and the new episodes coming out tomorrow
which someone made a supercut of every
time we use the word awkward on best of
the worst gig so me right yeah Betsy
this mentioned in the stream and yeah
because it's the best quality of that
movie to know yeah
red shell what I'm tiny make that light
Oh blue shells Oh dick evolution that
kind of sounds like there's no justice
she just overtook me and the blue shell
game no justice
oh did you throw the personnel it just
seems wrong you been in first place yeah
yeah no sometimes that's just the luck I
feel like I got hit by two red shells
right in a row watch tiny I asked for
someone named me yeah and so what it
overtook me in a movie okay such is life
sometimes you getting hit with red
shells
sometimes you're missing a bleep joke
sometimes you eat the blue shell
sometimes it needs you
I just want to play on my own
oh oh maybe is it just like a country
over you like
I don't know
yes there is still going to be a stream
on Friday yeah that's not it it's gonna
be a this is sort of an impromptu street
right special guest he came in late
basically we were trying to film for
previously the corner we're trying to
play this for previously deported and
there was a technical issue and we lost
two hours of footage and we just didn't
feel like we're doing it we're just sort
of sweet yep but you still will be
playing Friday but they know what the
somewhat special occasion is well Josh
can finally make it to a stream we've
finally worked that we finally figured
out a workaround for Josh's schedule so
josh is coming to the stream on Friday
nintendo64
oh it's gonna be crazy you guys like
polygons you like blurry screams yeah
it's gonna be it's gonna look but it's
gonna be a lot of fun a lot of four
player games someone generously donated
an n64 we have gold and I we have Smash
Brothers we have Mario Kart
ooh starfox yeah when I would play
Starfire will get a copy of star
the josh and i will talk about 20k yes

twin peak stuff last night yeah her I
think for most of the stream it's going
to be this it's this one peak stream I
want to play the Twin Peaks Super
Nintendo game that came out at the 1991
so listen I know I think actually most
history was just gonna be kind of rich
me and Josh and maybe Jessie and then
Mike and J will join us later
we have very important business to
attend to on Friday they're very very
important what happens um very important
business very important business happens
oh I think there's a movie coming dude
that has nothing to do no no I guess
maybe a little you see this
I have heard that the temporal I know in
Australia in Australia all right yeah
okay they release the post they posted
the poster on Twitter and it's um
jumping out of exploding building misses
with the September 11 yes
no you can't expect that to be a
cultural thing there well it's it's a
worldwide known event certainly it was
an oversight on somebody's part and they
didn't release it like um they really
said on their Twitter yeah like just
like their whoever's released me we
let's say it's paramount released it on
Paramount no it was something else for a
long time Oh what's a paramount in
Australia oh yeah it's a little it's
it's an oversight on their part and it
was kind of stupid but I don't think
it's worth being upset a song people we
got it down have people some people have
benefit it's insensitive but did not
intentionally did any Australians die I
mean sure they died on stencil you die
every day this is a good conversation
yeah okay we're gonna take it away I'm
gonna run a commercial and and we're
gonna come back and maybe play something
else or maybe not or maybe fuck you I
don't know this is the mood worried the
night folks left and you're gonna see
the spinning flower thing because I
don't have my little curly damn episode
every lately impromptu everything
everywhere everything's fine
