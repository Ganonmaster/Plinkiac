Cliff: Hi, Honey. I'm home.
Honey: Hi, dear. Here's your pizza.
Cliff: That's all you made for me is the fucking goddamn pizza?
Honey: No! No, Cliff, no! Oh, god!
Narrator: The Grabowskis.
really I've never tried hot wax before
rhotic it really is and you know what
you should get to know the candlestick
maker because he is so good okay good
some here start making dinner we're
having a guest tonight really who Frank
hammer he was on the east side he's
never over there had to invite him here
I had this settle the score it was
really a holy cliffs arch-nemesis and
the only man to survive getting punched
in the face by cliff and not getting
knocked out immediately
Oh live yeah how's that wife of yours
what's her name honey honey I'd better
this is sweet ass hey cliff I'm sorry
what did you say I'm saying that I'd
like a slice of that sweet honey pie
metaphorically speaking of course you
know cliff if you were to ever die or or
even be slightly injured I'd be over
there that little princess faster than
you can say
I'm saying that if she's the honey I
could be the king bee and that little
honey would get some of my king bee
honey you know some of my metaphorical bee
honey all over her face and boobs all
hail the king bee above I told you
there's no such thing as a fucking king
bee I'm sorry did you say something it
was more than just not getting knocked
out the man didn't even flinch
now I've punched out men statues horses
women even dinosaurs but not Frank hammer
he's like the Lois Lane to my Superman
don't you mean kryptonite to your
Superman no no I don't mean that at all
yes

like I'll be eating out yeah still got it
