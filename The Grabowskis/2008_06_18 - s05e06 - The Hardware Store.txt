Hardware Store Employee: Hi, sir. Can I help you?
Cliff: Yeah. Yeah, you can help me. I got a leak at home I'm trying to fix.
Hardware Store Employee: I sure can help you with that. What kind of leak is it?
Cliff: It's my wife's mouth. It won't quit running!
Hardware Store Employee: Good one, sir.
Cliff: No, but, uh, seriously. I'll take a double cheeseburger combo meal, no onion, large fry, large Coke, too.
Hardware Store Employee: Seriously, sir. How can I help you?
Cliff: I just told you my order.
Hardware Store Employee: Sir, you're in a hardware store.
Cliff: What? What?
Hardware Store Employee: Phil, call the police.
Cliff: What? What? What? You're mine!
