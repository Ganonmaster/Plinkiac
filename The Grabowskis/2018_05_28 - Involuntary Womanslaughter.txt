Honey: Darn meat pies. I like me some meat pies. Hi, Cliff.
Cliff: Hi, Honey.
Honey: How's it going?
Cliff: Well...
Honey: What happened?
Cliff: Well I was going to the dollar store to get some condoms and Slade II kind of came out in front of my car.
Honey: Did you hit somebody?
Cliff: yeah I mean yeah. It was an old lady. She just came out right in front of me. I was only going about 125 miles an hour.
Honey: Oh, my god. What did the police say?
Cliff: Well I didn't call the police.
Honey: You left the scene of an accident without calling the police? What if she was dead?
Cliff: Honey, there was blood all over the car on the street. I mean, I picked the bumper up. I tried to hide in the trunk, and get the hell out of there.
Honey: No, Cliff. I don't care about the car. What about the woman?
Cliff: Well, I did go up to her. She said, um, Help me, oh, god, I'm dying!
Honey: Oh, Cliff, if she's still alive, you can't leave her like that. You've got to go back, Cliff. You've got to finish it.
