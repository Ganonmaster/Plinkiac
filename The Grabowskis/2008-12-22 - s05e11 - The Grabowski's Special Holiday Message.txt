Honey: Happy holidays from the Grabowski's. Wave, Sammy.
Cliff: That's right, folks. What she said. Have a Merry bleep.
Honey: Cliff, you're not supposed to say the c-word.
Cliff: What, bleep?
Honey: No, bleep.
Cliff: Why the fuck can't I say bleep.
Honey: Cuz some people don't celebrate bleep, and they might get offended by the mere mention of bleep, so that's why we say happy holidays.
Cliff: Oh. Well, why are we doing this promo then?
Honey: We're doing it for the people who celebrate bleep, and for all the others, to.
Cliff: Others? Oh, like, like Hanukkah and Ramadan?
Honey: Don't forget Kwanzaa.
Cliff: The fuck is a Kwanzaa?
Honey: I don't know.
Cliff: Hey, and how come we could say those other words?
Santa: Did someone say cunt?
