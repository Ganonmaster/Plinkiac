Intro: There's good times and there's bad times, but mostly bad. The Grabowskis.
Cliff: Honey, who are all these people in this photo album?
Honey: Your family.
Cliff: Honey, why isn't the coffee pot working?
Honey: Because we don't have one. Honey, I think we should get a Costco membership.
Cliff: What?
Honey: Well, it's a really good investment.
Cliff: The hell's wrong with you? That's sickening.
Honey: Well, we could buy bulk in items like toilet paper or dog food.
Cliff: I can't believe you're even suggesting this. It's fucking gross. Oh, a Costco membership.
Honey: Honey, I've been going over our financial records, and it seems that our money is gone.
Cliff: Honey, is this hot?
Honey: Yes. Honey, it's three o'clock. I think we need to pick the kids up from school.
Cliff: We picked them up yesterday.
Honey: Honey, I think little Sammy needs to go to the doctor.
Cliff: No, he doesn't. Honey, I've been sleeping around, I think you should get a divorce.
