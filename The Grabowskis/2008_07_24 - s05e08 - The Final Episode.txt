Honey: Cliff, do you ever feel like our lives have just been a complete waste?
Cliff: Yeah.
Honey: Oh, wonder who that could be.
Cliff: I dunno. Let's go find out.
Salesman: Hello, are you the Grasblowskis?
Honey: Yeah.
Shamson: My name is Shamson Shonsonson, and I'm from the city, and I have to tell you that your building is being demolished, and you have fifteen minutes to leave. Thank you. Have a good day.
Cliff: That's not a lot of time.
Honey: I know.
Cliff: All right. I guess, get your stuff. Pigeon, and my iPhone. All right. That's everything.
Honey: What are we going to do now?
Cliff: Well, I was gonna open up a bar called Cliff's Place, and you could be dead.
Honey: Or, we could just stay at my mother's.
Cliff: Yeah, I guess. Let's go.
Honey: You know what, I'm really gonna miss this place.
Cliff: Me too, Honey. Lot of good times here.
Honey: Cliff, did you see that, too?
Cliff: Yeah, I did, and let's never speak of it again. Let's go! Thank you. Oh, my god, Honey. I cannot believe we forgot the toaster.
