Intro: There's good times and there's bad times, but mostly bad. The Grabowskis.
honey
I'm wait shut up don't finish that
sentence unless you want to find
yourself rolled up in some carpet with
27 stab wounds in you honey the last
thing we need right now is another
wallet leech crawling around the floor
wait we haven't had sex in two years how
are you pregnant well I wait shark it
was the butcher wasn't it no wait his
penis was chopped off by a meat saw it
was the Baker no his penis was baked off
it was the candlestick maker that's it
honey I said it before and I'll say it
again I'll say what I've always thought
since our wedding day you're a horrible
woman and I hate you now what were you
going to say pregnant with the
candlestick makers baby
