Mr. Plinkett [voiceover]: Half in the bag! Get this shit off my cabinet.

[Enter Mr. Plinkett's house. Mike and Jay are watching a movie.]

[Old country singer sings about gay Santa Claus, while livestock roam in an open field]

Jay: What is this?

Mike: It's a sing-along, with Frank Woehrle.

[Close-up shot of Mike holding a VHS copy of "Sing Along with Frank Woehrle"]

Jay: Oh, my god. He has the voice of an angel.

[Mike ejects the Frank Woehrle tape, and sets it on top of the TV]

Jay: What are you doing with the Frank Woehrle tape?

[Mike smashes the Frank Woehrle tape twice, with a hammer]

Jay: Oh my...!

Mike: That's what I'm doing to the Frank Woehrle tape.

[Mike expertly twirls the hammer around in his hand]

Jay: Who do you think you are with that hammer, MC Skat Kat?

Mike: No, I think I'm fucking Thor, the God of Thunder. By the way, have you seen "Couples Retreat"? It's a really funny movie.

[Scene from "Couples Retreat" plays]

[Jay watches as Mike chugs a Rolling Rock beer and a Red Bull at the same time]

Jay: You're gonna have a heart attack.

Mike: No, no, no. This is a depressant. This is a stimulant. They negate each other.

[Scene from "Thor" plays]

Mike: It's actually good for your heart.

Jay: So, it's kind of like not drinking anything at all?

Mike: Yeah.

[Scene from "Thor" plays]

Mike: So, we just saw the movie "Thor", which is a Marvel Comics feature, uh, starring Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. Um, it's about the mythical figure, Thor, the Norse god of thunder, who comes to earth after being banished from Eternia where he lives, uh, in a happy land with his dad and his mom. And, uh, he falls in love with Natalie's ass and wants to pound her mound into infinity, which is the general plot of the film. Would you not agree?

Jay: What movie did you see?

Mike: Jay, what did you think about "Thor"?

Jay: I enjoyed watching "Thor". I had a good time watching the movie. Uh, the whole thing is very silly. It reminded me of a sort of mid-budget eighties fantasy movie, like, uh, "Masters of the Universe" or "Krull". 

Mike: I really liked "Thor". I was, um, thoroughly entertained by it. Um, there were some problems, which I'll discuss, but, um, it, it is what it is.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: And that's kind of what category it falls in, into for me. 

Jay: Mm.

Mike: I really like the opening because it showed exactly, like, the world that Thor is used to. And, of course, that lended itself perfectly to a handful of fish-out-of-water jokes, um, which work. Um, there's just a few, just enough.

Jay: Yep.

Mike: They didn't push it too far.

[Scene from "Thor" plays]

Mike: Well, "Thor" is a bit of an arc. You know, as a character, he starts off kind of, like, immature, brash...

Jay: Arrogant.

Mike: Arrogant, headstrong, etcetera, and, um, he wants to start, he wants to fight people, he wants to prove his worth, and, you know, and then, you know, he gains some wisdom over the film. And I, I think that's all the movies about.

Jay: Yeah, it's very, very simple.

Mike: Yeah. 

[Scene from "Thor" plays]

Mike: In regards to "Masters of the Universe", there are two ways of doing these kind of movies: entirely in Thor's world, or entirely on earth, and they kind of kept going back and forth, and, and that, that was a little, like, oil and water to me.

Jay: Yeah, well, especially since the majority of things that are happening on earth are sort of, like, they feel like filler in this movie.

Mike: Yeah. 

Jay: Like, the...

Mike: Right.

Jay: Everything with Natalie Portman. Like, the only reason she exists, the only reason she's in this movie is to be the generic love interest.

Mike: Pretty much.

Jay: And there's not much else to that, and, uh, yeah, it sort of just feels like, "We need to put these things in, 1) so people have something they can connect to, and 2) to, to pad out the movie."

Mike: Yeah, yeah. I mean, Thor could have had a romance with a girl that was part of his warrior friends...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...tribe, or whatever. So I found myself, like, "Oh, yeah, Anthony Hopkins is Laura's dad, and, and, oh, he's injured, and, uh, Loki is doing this thing," and then it's like, "Oh, back to Natalie Portman in the desert."

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: What felt odd was when that robot came down to earth and started, like, blasting the town up.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: That felt, like, whenever something's in there, in a movie, it doesn't feel like completely natural to the story, and it's, like, we have to have a scene where, on earth, where action happens.

[Crosstalk]

Jay: Yeah. "We haven't had an action scene in 25 minutes!"

Mike: Well, not, not just a time frame, but all the action in the movie, essentially, takes place in Thor's universe.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And there's not a scene on earth where there's action. And, and there's, it's not connectible.

Jay: Yeah, yeah.

Mike: Um, but, but a thing knocking the car out of its way with its arm is connectible to the audience.

Jay: Right.

Mike: And, and that also gets Natalie Portman involved, and it merges those two. Um, which was fine. It's a cool action scene, but, um, it felt kind of unnecessary.

Jay: Yeah. All the action scenes of this movie are fun. They're very light-hearted. It doesn't feel like there's much at stake. Like it's, it's a very, there's not a lot of characters to really latch on to. It's all very, sort of, it's like fluff. This movie's fluff.

[Scene from "Thor" plays]

Mike: I think, I think overall, though, we might be overanalyzing "Thor". Um, not just because it's called "Thor". 

Jay: The movie is what it needs to be.

Mike: Pretty much, exactly. 

Jay: It's a Thor movie that's meant to set up another movie.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: Is basically what it is.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: One thing I don't understand about Kenneth Branagh's direction is the, the choice to have every blurred shot be a Dutch angle. 

Mike: The Dutch angle started to appear in the film halfway through towards the end. I, I saw a lot. 

Jay: There's a lot in the first half, too. 

Mike: And, and, and it goes from the most insane shit in outer space to, like, car driving down desert road. And so it seemed like, "Well, what do we do?" [Mike mimicks holding a camera] "Bwaahp! Turn the camera." That don't make it, like, a comic book thing. Like, it was really, like, "Why are they doing that?"

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And...

Jay: It's like someone that doesn't, which is probably the case with Kenneth Branagh, someone that doesn't know comic books, doesn't understand comic books, trying to make something that he thinks would look comic book-like. 

Mike: I don't know. 

Jay: I guess. 

Mike: I don't know.

Jay: There's more Dutch angles in this than the old Batman TV show, though.

Mike: No. No. That's an over-exaggeration for comic purposes. 

Jay: It was a point where the Dutch angles were getting so out of control that it was already on a Dutch angle, and he tried to turn it to another Dutch angle, and the movie was sideways.

Mike: Mmm.

Jay: Half of this movie was completely sideways. 

Mike: Or perhaps it was on a Dutch angle and such a degree that it ended up being straight again.

Jay: So, you're saying that the shots in this movie that are straight were maybe an accident?

Mike: Every shot was a Dutch angle, except for the, the Dutch angle shots which, ironically, were not Dutch angle shots.

Jay: Wow. 

Mike: Because it had all come full circle. Those are straight shots.

Jay: I see. Okay.

Mike: Or maybe they just had a broken tripod. So, to wrap up, I would recommend "Thor". Uh, I enjoyed it. Um, and it had, you know, it had its moments. It was fun, entertaining, uh, lots of good action, and I don't want to sound like a simpleton or a moron, you know, like, "It had lots of good action in it." But, for a movie that's about Thor...uh, it is a movie about Thor.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: And, and you will enjoy it on that level. Um, it's not boring or horrible or stupid or pandering or, you know, a Michael Bay movie.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: Uh, and it has Natalie Portman, and she has a pretty face. And it's nice to look at her face. And the ladies, you will like to look at Chris Hemsworth's perfectly cut abs and pectoral muscles. When I watched the film, there were several, uh, groups of ladies in the theatre who had all come. Middle-aged ladies, who were school teachers, um...

Jay: Not comic book fans.

Mike: Probably not comic book fans.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: But they were there for something. 

Jay: Do you think it could have been because of Stellan Skarsg√•rd?

Mike: Oh, right. Yeah. Oh, totally. I'm sorry, yeah. Um, but, yeah, "Thor"...uh, see "Thor" if you want to. I don't give a fuck.

Jay: I would also recommend "Thor" as maybe a lazy Sunday matinee movie. It's not great, not bad, but it's very charmingly simple, and there's great comedic relief by Sir Anthony Hopkins.

[Scene from "Thor" plays]

[Mike and Jay are watching a home workout video on Mr. Plinkett's TV]

Mike [suggestively, while licking his lips]: Yeah...

Jay: I don't even know who you are anymore.

Mike: What?

Jay: You realize we're watching a pregnancy workout video, right?

[Jay holds up a VHS copy of "Pregnancy Plus Workout"]

Mike: Yeah, I realize that. Fucking hot.

[Jay ejects the VHS]

Mike: Hey, why'd you hit stop?

[Jay unspools the magnetic film from inside the VHS tape]

Mike: Ohhh. Oh, ghtt...! You asshole. Fff-...wh-, wh-, what would you rather be watching, Joel Silverman's "Hollywood Dog Training Program"?

[Mike holds up a large, black, plastic case titled "Hollywood Dog Training Program"]

Jay: Is, is that a book?

Mike: It's a big VHS tape.

Jay: Oh, my god.

Mike: Oh. 

Jay: There's cassette tapes in there, too.

Mike: It's a whole program for Hollywood dog training.

Jay: Why does Plinkett have that? He doesn't even own a dog. 

Mike: I don't know.

Jay: That looks unwatchable.

Mike: Speaking of unwatchable, have you seen "The Hangover Part II"?

[Scene from "The Hangover Part II" plays]

Jay: So, "The Hangover 2" is "The Hangover"...again. 

Mike: Quite literally.

Jay: Yes, Mike. What did you think of "The Hangover Part II"?

Mike: Um, amazingly bad. 

Jay: Okay.

Mike: Not, not, mmm... okay. I'm going over the top. It, it was watchable. But boy oh boy, it was lazy. 

Jay: Well, comedy is very subjective, more so than maybe some other aspects, of other genres of film. I don't know...

Mike: I guess so...

Jay: I, I, I'd, like I said, I understand why that movie was so popular. I get it. And I liked the concept of the movie. I like the idea behind it. 

Mike: Oh, yeah.

Jay: When I, and I, I saw the movie long after it already had come out. I didn't see it in the theatres. And, uh, when I heard about it, it's like, "Oh, they, they got so drunk, they don't remember what happened the night before, and they have to find the groom. So they have to piece together all these elements." I was expecting something just even a little bit more clever than what it was, where, when they finally realize where the groom was, it...nothing that they discovered throughout the, the rest of the movie, before that, had built towards that.

Mike: No. No. 

Jay: It was like a mystery, but the ending was like, "Oh, I guess he's over here." 

Mike: Right. Right.

Jay: And it had nothing to do with anything. 

Mike: Yeah. One clue didn't lead to another that lead to another.

[Crosstalk]

Jay: Yeah, it, it's...

Mike: At least the second one had that.

Jay: Well, that's what I was gonna say, is that the first one, it is very much just a series of, uh, comedy set pieces.

Mike: Right.

Jay: And that's pretty much it. And I will go on record as saying that I kind of liked "The Hangover Part II", uh, for a lot of the reasons that people that love the first "Hangover" probably will hate the movie, uh, which is that it wasn't as broad, it wasn't as "crazy", and on a story level, it felt a little more cohesive.

Mike: Mm-hmm.

Jay: Uh, as far as the basic plot, it is, it is shockingly, uh, similar to the first one, and that is beat-for-beat, plot-point-for-plot-point, the exact same movie.

Mike: It's almost, like, intentional.

Jay: It's almost awe-inspiring how lazy they were being with the script.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: Uh, but tonally, it's sort of different. 

Mike: Very different. 

Jay: It's much sleazier. It's sleazy, it's darker, and it's more uncomfortable. And the theater I saw it in was just packed with people ready to laugh because they loved the first "Hangover". And most of the movie was lots of uncomfortable silences, and people shifting in their seats, and waiting for the hilarity to happen that never came.

[Scene from "The Hangover Part II" plays]

Jay: When I hear about an unnecessary sequel to a movie, I always have this running gag her I say, "Oh, no! It happened again!" And that's one of the first lines of dialogue in this movie. They actually say, "It happened again!" And they say things like that throughout the movie.

[Scene from "The Hangover Part II" plays]

Mike: The one thing I was thinking about early on was how terrible the editing was.

Jay: Yes. Yes.

Mike: It, it was just, like, cut, cut...

Jay It was jarring.

Mike: And then it was, like, "The Hangover Part II". Like, the title appears, and it wasn't, there was no, like, energy. 

Jay: It was like, "Here."

Mike: Yeah. "Here." And now, and then, the one thing that ran through my head was, "'Part II'. 'The Hangover Part II'," as in, like, it's a continuation of a story, and it's not.

Jay: No.

Mike: It's like, it's...

Jay: It's the same story.

Mike: It's like a different flavor of ice cream.

Jay: Well, I, I guess people like the idea of the first movie, but also what they liked is the, the characters and the performances, cuz this is a group of talented people...

Mike: No, the, the, the actors are all very likeable.

Jay: All you need to do is take those characters and put them in a completely different scenario... 

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: And you might have something.

Mike: Maybe, here's something crazy. Maybe it's not a wedding! 

Jay: Why does it have to be a wedding?

Mike: Oh, my god!

[Scene from "The Hangover Part II" plays]

Jay: Uh, and this movie played it as safe as it possibly could...

Mike: Right.

Jay: ...with the story. Similar to, like, "Home Alone 2", where it's the exact same movie in a different city.

Mike: Well, in "Home Alone 2", he wasn't in the house again. 

Jay: He was in New York City. He was in a different place.

Mike: So you're completely fucking wrong. 

Jay: Oh.

Mike: I mean, "Home Alone 2" broke new ground. It just shattered conventions.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: I mean, this is a wedding, a bachelor party, and things, you know...

Jay: So you're saying it's even worse than "Home Alone 2" in the story department. 

Mike: In "Home Alone 2", if Kevin McCallister was still at the...oh, here's this, here's the twist. Instead of going to Paris, the family is going to...London on their vacation.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: And, and Kevin gets trapped at home. And Kevin McCallister...and then throughout the film he sets up booby traps. 

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: But they're just slightly different.

Jay: Yeah. 

Mike: It's not the same exact booby traps.

Jay: Right.

[Scene from "The Hangover Part II" plays]

Mike: But, but sometimes when something's really bad, bad where word of mouth kills it...

Jay: Yeah. 

Mike: And I don't see how bad word, word of mouth could not have killed this.

Jay: Yeah, yeah.

Mike: Unless people are just like, "I love the first one, I love the first one, I don't care what you say, I'm going to see this, I'm going to see this," and, and that just got their money.

Jay: And talking about this movie being tonally different than the first movie...

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: ...even though story-wise it's exactly the same, is that in the first movie everybody reacts to everything, like, completely crazy, like, "Oh, my god! I can't believe we did this!" And in this one, there's certain sequences that get really creepy and dark and uncomfortable, and the characters acts almost believable, like, as if this actually happened.

Mike: Yeah. 

Jay: Which takes away from the hilarity, which makes it not funny to the people that like the first movie.

Mike: Yes. 

Jay: Uh, but to me, that was sort of interesting to see them, them treat the material in a different context like that. But there's long stretches of this movie where it's not even trying to be funny. 

Mike: Mm-hmm.

Jay: Where it's, it's almost just like a straight sort of mystery thriller movie. And there's a car chase sequence in the movie that I actually thought was, was pretty well-executed. I mean, do you, are you familiar at all with the director of this movie, Todd Phillips?

Mike: No.

Jay: You've seen the first "Hangover".

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: He directed that. He's always been a filmmaker that I've been intrigued by, even though I've never liked any of his movies.

Mike: What other movies?

Jay: He directed "Road Trip". Do you remember "Road Trip"?

Mike: Is that different than "Boat Trip"?

Jay: That's different than "Boat Trip". "Road Trip" is Tom Green. That was his breakout movie. He did that, he did...well, he did "Due Date".

Mike: Oh, I love "Due Date".

Jay: Yeah. And every movie he does is like that, where it's like, I'm sort of baffled by the movie, but people seem to love them. But his very first movie was a documentary about GG Allin.

Mike: Mm.

Jay: And then his second film was a documentary, kind of, about frat hazing. And so he has this sort of, like, subversive dark, quality to him, and I keep expecting that to show up in these mainstream movies that he makes, but he always seems to be just sort of playing to the cheap seats with these Hollywood comedies.

Mike: Well, this was certainly not that. The first "Hangover", yes. but not this.

Jay: The first "Hangover", and then that's, that's something I admired about this one but at the same time he alienated the audience that liked the first one.

[Pop-up box of total domestic revenue from "The Hangover Part II", showing almost $200m on a budget of $80m]

Mike: Apparently not.

Jay: I, I, well, but...do you think people are going to see this movie because they've heard it's a great hilarious follow-up to the first one?

Mike: No.

Jay: They're going to see it because the first one was successful.

Mike: Yeah, yeah. Pretty much.

[Scene from "The Hangover Part II" plays]

Jay: It's not as blatant as, like, a sequel that I love, I don't think you care much for it, but I love "Gremlins 2", and "Gremlins 2" is a very deliberate and obvious attempt to ridicule everything about the first movie, everything that made the first movie successful and just be completely balls-out crazy.

Mike: That, that's a good point.

Jay: I don't know if that was what they were trying to do with "The Hangover Part II" or not. Why can't you just make another story with these characters? 

Mike: Because the story is the fact they wake up drunk, and not remember anything. It's not the story about the characters.

Jay: Well...

Mike: I mean, the characters are I'm saying if you want to do a sequel that was something different that's what you can do is make it not them waking up and not remembering the night before not that would accept that 

yeah no no except unless it had the same premise 

yeah or a similar premise but but then you run into the problem that this movie does where it is the same premise down to every sort of beats 

right 

but but what I'm saying in addition to that is even mild tweaks yeah could have fixed that is someone with just you know a fourth-grade education could have done that like what like I suggested the simple simple premise there is no wedding 

yeah 

why is there have to be another wedding it says why does it have to be a bachelor party 

yeah why cat

there's so many other events in life that have drinking and partying that it didn't have to be a wedding 

sure 

so and and I have a fourth-grade education and I thought of that how about they go to something that's not known for parties they go to a software convention in Cleveland Ohio yeah and things get crazy and and there's a different premise right there 

so The Hangover Part two uh no I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a good funny comedy if you're looking for a worthy follow-up to the hangover if you like the first one I wouldn't recommend it for any of those reasons if you're looking to see a movie that is just like morbidly curious and how off-putting and wrong it is see with but that's you that's me that's what I'm saying mmm don't go see this one no one wants to go watch a movie out of the morbid curiosity of how how they how they can watch the audience in the theater with them be disappointed now people want to go to the movie to be entertained by it and whether it's an action movie a drama or comedy 

so you must withdraw your recommendation to see this movie on any love there must be other people out there like because there must be 

right 

oh there's no redeeming qualities in this movie know that that that would give them think of it as a just the general audience there's no redeeming qualities in this movie that would make me recommend it to any demographic it's not funny there's a couple little chuckles here and there but it's not funny it's not fuck this movie it's warping my mind 

yes 

it was just a bad idea 

yeah 

all around

yeah 

like there's a sequel it'll be real funny they go to Bangkok and that sorts of crazy stirring shit happens it'll be hilarious yeah and it's not hilarious it's it's kind of twisted and dark and kind of like okay it's supposed to be funny and twisted and dark can be funny sure incontinent ever anything can be funny in contexts but this is a movie where I don't know what the context was supposed to be right the context is not there you know you don't know what you're supposed to be laughing at or what you're supposed to be disgusted by 

yes 

and on there scenes where the Buddhist monks is hitting them with a stick for ten minutes and it's becomes the Three Stooges 

yeah 

or a monkey is smoking a cigarette and it's funny because monkeys don't smoke cigarettes and then then seen before that it's it's a it's a horrifyingly graphic description of how ed Helms was fucked in the ass by a transvestite 

yes 

and that's like that is is buttressed against that and you're like yeah hey guys check it out Alan cut it out with a monkey nibbles on the wieners it's funny in any language ever 

bamboo book it has everything from hidden treasures to battles inky suspense and it's like if that's what you mean if I got a book here that you pick up a good way for you you can think 

oh and we also saw x-men 

x-men first class of course needs no introduction as most of you have probably seen the other x-men films or know what the x-men are and have probably been waiting to see this film for a while as I have been 

x-men first class is essentially a prequel because it takes place before all the other x-men films and tells the origin story of Charles Xavier and how he formed the x-men and more importantly his friendship with Erik Lehnsherr who eventually becomes Magneto which is the focal point of the story 

Jay, what did you think about x-men first class 

I enjoyed the movie for the most parts

yeah 

the first half of the movie I would say I kind of loved but then at a certain point I noticed weird things started creeping into the movie that kept taking me out of it like one frame of a pornographic film 

no but what things are you talking about

uh well there was certain things where like dialog started to feel off and there was moments where the dialogue was very like hitting you over the head with its obviousness and then yeah the final action scene that the whole movie is are building towards because it's not a very there's not a lot of action in the rest of the movie no which I appreciated because it's more focused on the characters but when that action scene happens it felt very awkwardly handled some of the shots were bizarre and and comical unintentionally comical and then that whole sequence just went on way too long 

I liked x-men first class I did not love it I kept hearing how just awesome it was and and the trailer was perfect 

one path we shall never choose

I think it was a just a classic case of high expectations yeah being a little too high and and I think that was some of the problems maybe I'll appreciate it more upon more viewings because there was a lot going on in it but it's certainly not a bad movie no any means

oh no no I enjoyed it quite a bit um but I had the same problems you did where I was thinking actually for the first like half an hour of it I'm like wow you know idiots are gonna be really bored 

yes yes

as there's no there's no big like action opening it's very it's very subtle 

yeah

I I thought the guy that played Charles Xavier for me stole the show James McAvoy 

oh good job I have never heard of him before but he did a great job playing Xavier and it was nice to see Xavier as sort of like having a lot of youthful energy it was fun to see him like hitting on ladies and using terms like groovy yeah and things like that

yeah 

I think that's what the earlier films are kind of lacking was that they're sort of established like Xavier school for gifted youngsters Xavier Cyclops you know and and there's no like humanity yeah and this one Xavier was like I'm I'm Xavier I'm excited about things 

yeah

and it's fun and it's interesting to see like him talk about how mutants should be out in the open and proud of themselves but that's because he can't relate to the ones that have physical 

yeah 

elements that make them look different than other people 

yeah 

he in a bit he wasn't he was a little naive

yes 

about 

yeah 

the things demo the movie almost empathizes more with Magneto 

listen to me very carefully my friend killing will not bring you peace peace was never an option 

the main conflict in the movie is between those two not necessarily Sebastian Shaw versus Magneto 

right 

and that's what drives the movie and that's what I thought was pretty well done 

I will agree with you yes it was well done and and and being that that's the core of the movie that's what makes it work for me but the frustrating stuff comes from the details there are shots in this movie they're so cheap looking it looks like kind of like a comedy film like like there's there's the ending as you know from the trailer takes place during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the excellent sort of intervene in this and there's shots aboard a battleship that which are like if you would imagine a comedy scene aboard a battleship that's how you would shoot it the bridge the windows almost like almost like a like a John Wayne movie from the 40s or the 50s where it's just like the bridge of the battleship or like a Naked Gun movie or like a Naked Gun with specifically the binoculars the so there's a shot where the captain has the binoculars it's as cliched almost and and the cameras pushing in and he lowers the binoculars and it's Michael Ironside because I we saw there and I was I started laughing I started laughing and it was like because that the whole thing feels like that's the punchline like I'm making gun movie or it's like he lowers the binoculars it's like of course it'd be Michael Ironside 

right right yeah 

and you know some average moviegoer might not know but I was expected to see Leslie Nielsen when it launched think at one point Michael Ironside goes gentlemen it's been an honor serving with you and it's like it is flash if you know anything but like a sitcom filmmaking specifically flat shots at eye level are typically funny 

yeah 

at least for comedic effect I don't know who directed this but Matthew Vaughn and it's like right in the middle of all this dramatic tension between Magneto and Xavier yeah that cuts it keeps cutting to michael ironside constantly

yeah 

why are we cutting to him who is he he's just the commander of one of the ships we should have never seen anyone 

yeah 

on any of the ships ever don't show them 

yeah yeah 

ever just keep showing Xavier and boats in the water and like because the movies about mutants trying to like mingle intermingle with human affairs 

yes 

don't even show them they're like ants you know but they keep cutting back to Michael Ironside what no 

should we hit the button the nuclear button no first of all not be risk allies doing so we have it has to be the better man we already evolved in

the first three x-men movies Xavier and Magneto was always kind of like this little thing that would crop up 

yeah 

and it was always the Wolverine show 

yeah

and and to me and I guess to most other people x-men is always Xavier versus Magneto yeah because it's two conflicting ideologies and Xavier has his guys magneto has his guys and the conflict in x-men is do we side with humans or do we wipe them out are they our friends or are they our enemies or or in a different way of saying it is should we protect the ones that hate us and that's the conflict in x-men and it's not Wolverine Xavier and and and and Magneto are the kings on the chessboard and they're all the other characters are the pawns okay and and that's the story and that's what this movie focused on yes and that's why it's good 

right 

it's just the technical things that's sure that day and some of the script things because some of the dialogue in this movie there's a certain there there's one scene in particular that that completely I don't want say derailed the movie for me but it definitely took me out of the movie to the point where I have trouble getting back into it which is was it the scene where January Jones said anything what  January Jones is terrible in this movie but we'll get into that they love to get into that there's a scene in this movie where what's beasts Hank McCoy there's a scene in this movie where Hank McCoy comes in with like the serum that will cure him and Ravan / mystique of their physical differences from humans and every line of dialogue in that scene is awful like like laughably bad and there's no scenes before that that were that bad and it really took me out of the movie to the point where I thought like is this a reshoot like did they do this because they didn't think that the point of the movie was coming across well enough so they redid it that scene onward is when I noticed problems starting to to pop up 

yeah yeah yeah uh

another thing that that you bring up that sort of was hit over the head with a hammer was the parallel especially in the third one which a lot of people have discussed was mutants as homosexuals and that whole social message science fiction has always been more like respected or more um you know noteworthy if while it's doing science fiction it's making commentary on society or social issues sure but the core of x-men is humans hate mutants but mutants are good enough to want to protect humans well you can take that and make it that blatant words like humans hate mutants

yeah 

and an individual viewer can apply anything they want to chance it needs the racism sexism homophobia whatever it doesn't need to be so specific where you have characters saying like mutant pride 

right 

and it makes it - that's the point of it is humans have the capacity to hate something that's different
yes 

it's all in the verbage because mystique says mutant pride pride is associated with with gay power is associated with with domination white power black power you know magneto magneto is is um is mutant power yes he's the militant and and and Xavier is more of mutant rights and rights are kind of like more equality civil rights like the civil rights movement um gender rights women's rights I would have liked a little bit of the other elements in there too 

do you not I mean 

yeah 

another mutant already here 

why didn't you say say what because you don't know 

I am so so terribly sorry Hank

and he's like well they did ask so I didn't tell didn't ask so I didn't tell that's like oh that's like saying shock and awe yeah like shock and awe is clearly labeled towards bush intolerant bigoted take gave you right o sleep it alone just absolutely enormous no I I think the movie should exist on its own and don't hate their mutants they're looked at as being weird and different the ends because we get it without it

yeah 

we get it without the hammer all the performances are very good the movie aside from January Jones she delivers her lines like she has no idea what movie she's in 

yeah 

we have a situation they're recruiting or or what being a human being this she's she's really bad 

yeah 

and I haven't seen her in anything else so I have no point of reference but who her her lines are like nails on a chalkboard like wow 

yeah

there is no it comes off like when and when an athlete host Saturday night life yes that's kind of acting it's a good analogy 

oh and another thing we should we should kind of talk about is at some point I noticed that the movie felt a little like cheap for being like a major x-men movie like some of the visual effects 

yes 

some of the some of the effects of the movie are like off-puttingly bad 

sure Emily the movies about the characters in the story so the visual effects aren't important but they shouldn't kind of distract you it comes with some of the effects not all but some of the effects come off like kind of like sci-fi channel kind of CGI looking like television quality and and I was expecting just like you know top-of-the-line effects for an x-men movie chair and they're not really there which is not a big concern but it's noteworthy it's one of those things like I was saying halfway through the movie there's certain little odd things that start to take you out of the movie 

yeah

and when enough of those crop up that's what sort of spoils the movie for you what's good about this movie and in comparison to like the third or third film or the second film maybe is the third film a lot of the comments about it is that it's so cluttered with characters 

yes 

um it's a very muddled movie and this movie they albeit briefly they take the characters and there's a kind of a fun training sequence where we learn like the characters can't really control their powers and Xavier starting to learn how to become a mentor on training them with their powers so you learn a little bit about each character and what what their limitations are and what their fears are and stuff like that and that pays off when they use their powers at the end yeah and that's all we needed from like a character like banshee or havoc 

right 

it was just a little bit of introduction banshee doesn't quite know what to do 

have I can't control those powers 

it's so great and and then at the end they learn how to focus them in control 

yeah that's right 

nice example 

yeah 

for a movie  that's this sir because it's a long movie that's a pretty long movie 

yeah 

so for a movie that within this length and and covers this much period of time and this many characters is all balanced fairly well 

right yeah right 

I just wish it was more silly wish it was more silly x-men should not be taken super seriously 

yeah

magneto needs to go it's the x-men nicer fighting the the Hellfire Club have a secret submarine underneath the ship and Kevin Bacon's there and he's in the he's in the Sebastian a sure on that helmet yeah and it's like shocked 

yes 

immense ik don't you shouldn't you be proud of the way you were born and our big theme has always been tolerance if you're different to be proud it's okay giant robots people going look out it's the x-men you know like one or the other
yeah 

if you're gonna have Kevin Bacon and a secret submarine grabbing on to to radioactive nuclear rods you know then go overboard yeah and don't cast Michael Ironside yes like Alliance I don't kiss Michael iron unless it's unless it's McHale's Navy starring Kelsey Grammer cuz it's a comic book it's not a social commentary on the the intolerance of people against homosexuality it's a movie about people that fight each other with superpowers 

yes yes 

and it doesn't need to be anything more than that 

who's with me listen to me very carefully my friend killing will not bring you peace

so I would have to of course recommend X-men first class I wouldn't recommend it to Grandma because Rambo no fuck's going on but if you are a movie fan if you're a comic book movie fan if you're an x-men movie if you're any kind of movie fan you should probably go see x-men first class do you agree 

I would agree I I I enjoyed the movie for the most part it had lots of issues it's not a perfect movie no it's not a great movie it's not the best x-men movie but there's lots of good stuff in it lots of good performances yeah lots of fun stuff 

yeah 

lots of fun stuff 

yeah

ah good old Richard Simmons I loved his tapes 

oh yeah yeah he really helps off fat swells 

no absolutely they need all the help they can get they're repugnant

well it's like once you go over a certain weight you're no longer human I mean fatso should be should be chained and putting the zoo for all I care

yeah well it's good because Richard Simmons once that's us to avoid that kind of shame and ridicule if you can lose weight so they don't look so an opponent 

did you know Richard Simmons used to be a porker really 

mmmm 

it was like 300 pounds 

holy shit 

um yeah cuz you know there's a lot of calories in semen but Richard Simmons you know he really gives me a hard-on um but um you know he helps the Fatso's you know lose the weight and feel good about themselves with these cookies 

hey sorry you know this is my favorite part of this tape you seen this before

yeah 

worse a lot of times a Tracking's off again with the tracking 

mm-hmm 

on the VCR there goes we've been watching VHS tapes all afternoon so well the VCR works 

yeah obviously what's your point

we're here to fix the VCR it's supposed to be broken 

oh fuck that's right I completely forgot why is it working

oh shit you know what I think I accidentally fixed it a couple weeks ago what I'm sorry it was like second nature you know cuz I'm a VCR repair man it just 

yeah 

and I was not even thinking I was just on autopilot pretending to fix it think it was over there and I think I might have fixed it obviously I did 

Oh what are we gonna do about this there's only one thing we can do
