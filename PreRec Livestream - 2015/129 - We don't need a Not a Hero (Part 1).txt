It, it totally looks like a Jack game.
But I wanted to play it.
And Jack's not here.
So I'm gonna play it.
It's called Not a Hero.
And I've only played this game a little bit.
And I have, I have since reset it.
So, here we go.
Hit the play button.
All right.
So, that was Bunnylord, a purple bunny man.
If I had a song called Purple Rabbit, I would've played that instead.
But I don't.
The_rising_sun, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right.
So obviously there are a bunch of unlockable characters.
But the only one we have right now is Steve.
So we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna play this game.
The echo is, is totally minor and acceptable?
Okay.
Then we're gonna deal with it for now.
All right.
Left stick or D-pad to move.
Easy enough.
And the, uh, A button does some slide-y stuff.
And, uh, this is a 2-D sidescrolling pixel art cover-base shooter.
As you can see, he's in shadow behind that, that cabinet.
That's, he's in cover.
So this is a cover, this is a shooting game, with reloading and everything.
And he says amusing things as you shoot people.
I'm, I'm fine.
It's not terribly challenging so far, especially with the regenerating health.
I'm assuming most of the, uh, challenge is going to come in, uh, time, doing it quick, and, and doing the little achievement things down at the bottom.
All right.
Ooh, special weapons.
They didn't seem to notice that explosion.
All right.
Tutorial.
Tutorial is done.
I did all the, the unlock things.
Landowastaken, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right.
We're gonna continue.
So, you say the audio sounds static-y?
Uh, DaveAA005, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
It's an okay game, so far.
Not much of a challenge.
I'm assuming the challenge is going to be doing the accomplishment-type things.
I, I don't know.
We'll, we'll see.
TourGuideNixon, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right.
And we're moving on.
I don't think Jack would like this game.
Jack would complain about the cutscenes.
Uh, as far as where I found it, uh, Steam.
Oh, shit.
I'm dead.
All right.
Steve, not as, I mean, uh, not Steve, Cletus, not as good.
Not as good.
Gonna try again.
Always be reloading.
Oh, I suck at this guy.
Well, we're never going to, uh, I'm never going to get the, the five-kill streak.
This is, this is a disaster.
Burning people's nice.
All right.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna retry that.
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna get that under the time.
All right.
Restart.
We're gonna beat the time.
Totally gonna beat that time.
Out of bullets.
Out of bullets.
I'm out of bullets.
Oh, fuck it.
Fuck.
Restart.
This game is okay.
I, I, I'm worried it's gonna get old fast.
All right.
One more time.
This was, like, thirteen bucks.
Wasn't that much.
Restart.
All right.
I'm gonna try this one more time.
Did I say one more time?
I meant two more times.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
All right.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Twelve sec-, I think I've got it, I think I got, I think I got it.
And, I think we did it.
Whoo!
What, what animal is Jack marrying this time?
Oh, he's not marrying an animal.
He's on his honeymoon, with the bear.
He's, he's taking her to a circus.
I mean, that's, that's kind of sick, you know?
He's taking her to see other bears in chains?
I, I don't get it.
I don't get it.
I did not know I could've gotten this game on GOG.
That's probably where I would've gotten it.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Owl warehouse.
I love their voices.
Uh, FearfulSludgeboy, I've played plenty of Bloodborne.
Let's see what characters I got.
I'm going back to Steve.
I'll take that range, and clip size over, honestly, I'm not, I'm not sure what advantage this has compared to the shotgun.
At least I got more killing power against guys like that.
I don't, I dunno.
Oh.
Ooh, owl.
Sixty seconds.
Oh, god.
Time to run.
Almost forgot to reload.
Something there?
There's nothing there.
All right.
Nothing there for me.
Go back down.
Go back down.
All right.
What didn't I do in the list of things to do?
I missed something.
I'm gonna try it again.
This is far more action, fast-paced than, uh, Gunpoint ever was.
There's some visual similarities, but not that much alike.
Oh, I can use the special weapon.
Oh, fuck.
Steve died.
All right.
Four kills in five seconds.
I'm probably gonna have to do that with the specialist.
Don't forget to reload.
Oh, shit.
That didn't work out too well that time.
Did I see any of the leaked Suicide Squad stuff?
No, I have not.
To tell you the honest truth, I, I don't really give a rat's ass about the Suicide Squad, so I haven't gone out of my way to, to look at any of the related materials.
It's kind of, like, eh, whatever, who gives a fuck.
Oh, shit.
They shot you off the ledge.
That was not stupidity.
This guy's packing much.
I missed something over therek, didn't I?
Hello, person who just said hello.
AlzheimerPenguin.
Ow.
Ow.
Regenerating health.
I'll be fine.
Dammit.
We're gonna do this.
We're gonna do this, goddammit.
Nope.
Nope.
I'll try a few more times, then I'll give up.
Fuck.
Oh, now I can't get the owl.
All right.
So I have to go out that way.
Rich Evans, can you say poo-poo platter for me?
No, I, I cannot say poo-poo platter, so do not ask me to say poo-poo platter.
It's just not gonna happen.
Can't knock him over.
Get four kills later on.
Fuck.
I don't think I used all those other grenades.
I wanna get those four kills.
If I don't do it this time, this'll be the last time.
Where you guys going?
Yeah!
What a weird grenade.
But a cool one.
Can I go down...?
Nope.
Sweet.
All right
All right.
That's not bad.
That's not bad.
25 pixels tall.
He shrugs his shoulders.
Punched...oh, shit.
Well, whatever.
Wow.
Okay.
She died quick.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
I don't think I'm gonna do it.
Get 'em!
All right.
That was bad.
Oh, shit.
Too high.
Too high.
That didn't work out like I wanted.
Yeah, it's just me today.
It's a solo stream.
Ow.
Don't get dickpunched.
She, I'm playing as Samantha right now.
She can't get dickpunched.
She literally can't get dickpunched.
It's the one thing that's not gonna happen.
Oh.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
I, I suppose Samantha, Samantha could be transgender.
Whatever, whatever.
Fine.
If you reall want dickpunch that bad, fine.
She can dickpunch.
Cuz it makes you feel better.
Got it!
Did it!
Oh, I got punched, though.
We gotta try again.
I'm sorry.
All right.
No punches.
No getting punched, or whatever.
Yes!
Did it!
Going back to Steve.
Had a lot of luck with Steve.
Ooh, I can't jump.
All right.
Teaching me about obstacles, I think.
We'll see.
Nope.
Ooh, nice weapon.
Ooh, if you reload, it goes back to the standard.
That sucks.
It's a kill streak goal right here.
Oh, fuck.
Ooh, secret stuff.
Six of eight kill streak.
We might do it.
Doesn't say that there's a time limit.
All right.
Now we gotta find all the power-ups.
If I haven't fucked that one up already.
Killshot.
Came from here.
Oh, I, I did everything already.
All right.
Now I just gotta find the stupid cakes.
Sweet.
All right.
How do we get down there without dying.
I think I see it.
That's powerful shot.
First try.
Steve rocks.
What a weird game.
In a good way.
But what a weird game.
Look at chat.
Have we got, had any, uh, subscribers in a bit?
None that are showing up, but none of them have shown up, which is weird.
Let me disconnect.
Here we go.
All right.
Back to the game.
The game!
Fearfulsludgeboy, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right.
What do we got?
Less that 20 hits.
Six kills in twelve seconds.
Steal all the bonsai trees.
Except that it is not.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
What happened.
What happened.
All right.
Good.
We got the hard one out of th eway.
Though I might have missed something up there.
That's not good.
Probably missed a bonsaid tree.
I probably missed the other one in there.
Fuck.
All right.
Let me try that again.
Whoa.
Oh, he drinks, he takes a drink before he dies.
All right.
Nothing interesting over there.
Had to check.
Had to check.
Yes, this game does have regenerating health.
Oh.
I thought I was dead.
He can' slide?
Well, he can.
Why wasn't he before?
I dunno.
I don't understand.
I don't understand all of the mechanics.
Fuck.
Trying to get those six kills because I know that's going to be the hard one.
All right.
They're dead.
That's good.
I'm gonna have to be careful at the amount of hits I take.
Oh, shit.
I missed a bonsai tree.
Missed a bonsai tree.
Gonna have to redo it.
Sorry.
Ehh, son of a bitch.
No, fuck!
Nope.
Three more attempts, and then I'm just gonna go for the main objective.
I'm not gonna worry about all the side...objectives.
Oh, fuck it.
Fuck it.
Disappointing.
I can go back up?
Never mind.
I thought I might be stuck.
Fuck.
All right.
How, how, shotgun guys, difficult.
Difficult.
And he's a shotgun specialist.
Shotgun specialist!
Take cover, you...
Shit.
What, what game do I hate that I reference so much?
People reference things they hate all the time.
Yeah, Mass Effect.
I reference it so much because I hate it.
People obsess about two things.
People obsess about things they love.
And people obsess about things they hate.
Taking my time.
Doing it right.
Taking my time.
Doing it right.
I'm going to take this shotgun guy from behind.
Taking my time.
Taking my time.
This isn't timed right now.
He's not that, he's dead, so...
