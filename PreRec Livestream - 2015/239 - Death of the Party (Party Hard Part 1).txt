waiting for Lisa to get home but there's
no idea how long that's gonna be
nor do I so I'm just started streaming
button because fucking fucking here's my
idea for a spooky game because whatever
whatever we can change it up on jackets
here doom doom that's gonna be a lousy
rich heaven solo stream right on talk
much also I'm going to suck because the
way I have this set up this I you know I
was expecting to be story more Jack so
ultra violence I think ultra violence is
a fine difficulty I don't have my good
nice gaming first-person shooter mouth
so oh shit I'm doing this on it I'm
using a standard cheap Mouse and it's on
like the couch the arm of the couch so
this is gonna work out just great let's
reload do I have everyone damn it
options see normally I got my nice Mouse
has like four buttons on the side and
one of my side buttons is reload and now
I got a what yeah that's mouse 2 is not
reloading why isn't mouse to real oh oh
fucking shit fucking bullshit that's
what it is
alright why aren't you reload
okay
oh I am fully loaded I'm an idiot I'm
looking at the wrong side I am a dumb
purchas a moron
everybody riches the moron rich is
stupid
all right stupid that didn't reload no
okay it's not reloading the reload
button doesn't work and I don't know why
oh fuck off game do you just not like
this mouse and oh fuck okay so I can
only reload by running out of ammunition
this is fucking bullshit
I've been reloading in a dream game and
a my I don't even have my run button
oh no I missed my nice Mouse so much so
much so much cock trolls
where's my run title run Oh God
we work for run you won't reload but
will you run are you just won't reload
most you won't reload it will run
actually nothing will reel of because
that's not working right
why that's too weird there's got to be a
reason for that
and I don't know what it is
why are you not reloading you stupid
weapon
let's try that
there we go why are the two options this
rebind reload and one of them doesn't
work that is the silliest thing I think
I've ever seen keep mind I'm using this
mouse mouse on a goddamn couch arm I
don't have any of my equipment and it's
driving me nuts
how's everyone doing in that chat I
can't see because I'm playing the game
just assume I'm reading everything and
love you all very much
yeah I don't plan like crap
what are you complaining because this is
it a scary a spooky game and you know
you talk about dead space in the chat I
look over occasionally no I forgot to do
that but the scary thing is that I'm
using a shitty Mouse on the arm of a
couch that's what's scary that should
that should frighten anybody who cares
it all about games and the way they are
playing
merci
probably use it for secondary fire
that's that's obnoxious I guess I don't
have one no I have to have
now when I get home I'm gonna set all of
this shit back the way it was all of it
back there we go
die motherfuckers
almost gotta fall in there
yeah
do I feel compelled to shoot up a school
now you people you people
here footsteps hello
yeah I'm streaming it happens then late
family comes first that's probably you
should never have a family huh boom yeah
I started with is the most III I'm
playing this with a shitty Mouse on the
arm of college so I don't want to do
this for long
well we got the thing here and he came
then he left right away jack is now gone
leaving me to the harsh realities of the
world yet again
who's ever this is mine now
you know my cats and rivets
shitty job and a very shitty job well
way to go way to go and then I was made
a little extra Lynch I made a little axe
really because I was talking to two
Jamis downstairs yeah
about some extra shots I need to do and
some shots that I don't need to do for
the captain space so he's filling a hard
drive full of goodies for me good that's
a major progress time this week on the
light bars and the such
you know what I had today what some some
some potato chips I feel bad for you if
there wasn't a kitchen full of food
ten feet away from you what do we have
in there you are here every day if you
don't know what's in there I'm gonna say
this is your that's all other people's
food other people I said I think it's
community food yeah they have all said
that it's community food and so I I want
to be that jerk eating somebody else's
lunch you know if it happens once I
think it's acceptable and so I'm
officially not going to feel bad all
right so are we we're doing something
else because I can't stand playing doom
with this shitty mouse ARM arm of a cow
a proper mouse pad sure it's terrible
sure terrible the fridge is full of
mustard you're right I had doughnuts no
I saw bagels over there as a oatmeal
oatmeal's the delicious food I saw many
things over there that it that it's open
for the eating's I was gonna leave you
know I was gonna go walk to the subway
earlier but I I didn't know when you're
gonna show up I don't want to not be
here you know with you at the door no I
mean you know it's fine it's fine that
was a little up in the air but like I
said damn there's free food I don't
actually know if you fell down four
times you'd be in there all right we've
talked about me not wanting to steal
other people's food yeah I thought we've
talked about any but it's open its open
from what what it what is the chattin
what what's it what's the jet say Oh
Deadly Premonition I think Jay would
appreciate that ly premonition somebody
else mentioned party hard was Deadly
Premonition the one that was supposed to
be like the Twin Peaks inspired maybe
yeah do we have that we can we get it
online
what's party hard um I mean let me
Google some stuff here party hard I
already own I already own party hard it
was gifted to me like the other day
actually timely very timely I enjoy the
Andrew wks
party hard that's wait is this a spooky
butter person who kills everybody at a
party okay if we can count this as a
spooky game then you know it's up so why
not right I I'm just gonna counter this
game because we haven't and okay hold on
I'm going to update the stream party
hard
oh how is the sound of this relative to
everything right now it's looking a
little loud it's looking I get a town
I gotta turn down pretty far I miss I
don't I was pretty young in the eighties
those that find good grades great great
all right it's perfect everything's
perfect perfect yeah change the game was
Freeman I did the OBS yeah there we go
it's done Minnie I gotta hit them okay
yeah it's okay here we go
here we go party party hard
this is the most game or is this a
controller game my house is bling
I know literally nothing about this game
it wasn't it just for new game okay we
are about to party hard
you have to stealth kill everyone at a
crowded party
think slow-paced oh okay cool yeah kind
of spooky Hemi acting in an indie game
who would have thought that somebody
with no budget couldn't afford
professional actors okay you might be
using
oh yeah okay great next to kill well
nobody is watching
okay okay why need to activate trap
someone saw you he's running away okay
okay everyone there's another guy by the
motorcycles um Oh him all right oh and
you start dancing yeah you know I think
this might be this might have been a
situation where they they should have
just cut the voice-acting yeah wherever
oh my god just to kill everyone yeah so
like this isolated person up here
probably be easy pickings oh sure okay
now what does dancing dude dance
maybe that helps you blend in Oh rich
you missed yeah I know I missed Oh
someone saw you kill him before they get
to the phone oh all right let's try this
again what can we do
maybe there are some traps you could set
I'd miss them do it okay
yeah hide body okay okay fine Clem oh
there's someone there's two people
asleep in the bathroom I bet you could
kill them pretty easily all right
oh no I see I see quite a stab nice make
sure to close those doors so I guess
they see by what proximity I I don't
know I have no idea how this works
oh that looks like a trap did you set it
break electric box I don't know if I
want to do that yet maybe I don't want
to do it oh sure sure our Miller says he
watched screaming for the first time in
his life last night
why do you think screams all right I
think it's fine it's fine okay kill them
both at once oh you better
is there no Run button oh there's none
of us Stanley
stamina Eman aah Oh what happened oh
look there's another young couple
heading to the bedroom
go get him go get him
this is level 1 yep
this kind of seems insane for level 1
don't you think stab the cop you're
under arrest I can't stab the cop yeah
you know like scream the first scream
was an interesting thing because it was
one of those like self-aware doesn't
need I got it really gonna needed eight
sequels oh wow what's it joy a thing
yeah he is there anything lose your
surroundings wisely wish victim into
fire
muscles need I wanted to bet yeah but
they're surrounded by people they're
surrounded like piece by black black one
Oh what is that one start the engine
oh there you go oh sweet that's how you
do that can you go like cut the phone
line and probably make it too easy I'm
gonna say no oh there's a ronald
mcdonald clown okay okay nice what ha
how do they call the cops
I don't know what the fuck happened
where's the any cheap where's the any
key what the mouse was on the capture
screen oh that would bother me as well
thank you for pointing it out how the
car is gone
maybe shows up later damn it as a horse
so there is a horse there now frightened
horse need victim
this seems weird UO apparently you have
to stay away from the bodies when
someone finds it or people will suspect
us you just pile them up in the bathroom
yep oh okay so you can murder people
while other people in the same room ah
fuck rich you might be you might be I
might be terrible at the see weapons
ever this game or it might be a bad game
yeah these are the two options it was so
literally the very first time I played
the game that I'm just not good at it
yet is there a drug lab in there now yes
how's that drug lab always been there
sure why not I think there might be some
randomization which is good to the party
levels
yeah you know I I'm gonna go with
unpowered rap here I think the first
level of a game needs to be a little
simpler give me you know give me a
longer tutorial help murderer no I don't
want to be arrested and get away cap I
really like the idea of this game tell
you what I think we need to get a little
bit more of a chance that you're giving
it so far a little bit more oh I'm not
saying we should stop playing it I'm
saying I might have this pegs already
the first the first a little bit of a
game is very important rich
where are the little sparkly things all
right I'm not near a body then will the
cops just not know it was me is that you
blending in yeah yeah oh yeah then the
cop leaves nice Oh
all right now we understand thing there
are so many fantastic games that don't
need to hold your fucking hand I listen
I'm not asking a game to hold my hand
I'm asking for just a little bit more
understanding before they throw you
right in oh no I think he's got to this
thing someone must have seen you okay
okay
so if they actually see you yeah I think
you need more traps I think that the
real thing is your ears needs more
stabby stab or less stabby stab more
like like this car thing that I use all
the time let's go that's great the car
thing is great yeah you need more stuff
like that I bet there's more stuff
around the house sure my bad what is
that hey buddy
oh is that what those sparkles are
there's like little sparkles everywhere
like like shimmers and I think those are
the traps oh oh the meth lab is burning
up
did you set that on fire
yeah nice quick stab okay nothing to see
over here to do to do to do to do Oh
rich what are you doing too many too
many oh it's already beat me to death a
frat boy beat yo you can't just go in a
little crowd said seven I'm gonna put
this out there is you might be the worst
murderer ever yeah maybe maybe I don't
think you have that killer instinct no I
really don't from quite a nice guy what
I was I kind of in front of it hey dude
I got a gym it does sound a little bit
like Herbie Hancock rocket doo doo doo
doo doo doo also a little axel F hmm
look yeah what was that Sparkle over
there tyrella vanished that's a trap
what is that I'm supposed to fall on
somebody
oh if someone goes there to fall on them
yeah maybe there's gotta be something
like that looks like a drug deal there
you know it's it's like can you mess up
the drug deal and then they shoot each
other we're in the right hand middle
there's a briefcase on the ground
between two groups of people right hand
middle right hand middle okay there get
out of there go there nice nice cops we
need more cups thank you
yeah I just made a new folder okay
disregard everything
so it's not like these are shops in
addition to the old folder is there's
the system you is just those all the
shots ever yes that I need to do yes
okay I can do that all right great
you're a murderer at a house party and
you need to murder all the people Oh Jay
was looking prison simply on the screen
so if you can see you're the little
white-faced guy that's like down by the
front door yeah and you have to
stealthily murder everyone at the house
party will buy it and also not get
caught by the cops
it's called party hard you know as one
as you would think nice rich is getting
a lot better at stabbing people it took
him a while as you do as you do would
you would you like to sit for a little
bit are you getting back to work a
little high 0z you can listen to the ax
left theme on constant repeat it's as
close as they could legally get them yes
what can we do here what you guys lay
off what happened Oh
they keep screaming about you needing
food and we're done talking I love it I
don't have time to get food foot stream
we got some pretzels I might have some
pretzels
there's like I told rich there's there
seems to be an abundance of forever
don't eat the bread rich so anything
okay Jack I just poison the food yeah
okay I also broke the stove
you broke the stove I think bad things
are gonna happen
great oh yeah I don't know if we can
hear Jay Jay I'm talking I'm watching
rich attempt to stab people I'm gonna
keep talking because I was informed keep
talking I was at Shea keep talking I
should be good
oh my god should be
they saw me they saw me I kind of opened
the door okay okay one more time here we
go this is like a combination of XLF and
that other song right it's the video
with like the robot legs and roving hand
facts wrong yes yes yes Jim isn't Chad
and he pointed that out okay and we all
agreed hi Jim but I just finished the
cryo lab he listed somebody else in the
party that's great why what happened I'm
sorry I missed dad I was telling them
earlier that you were you have now given
me all of the shots yes that's it that's
it it's like a dozen and it's only like
a dozen show maybe not even that
yeah so very exciting we're getting
there every day there's less and less
for me to do in fact there's almost
nothing left for me to do which is good
that's very exciting let's just meet
personally though nobody this party
thinks it's like weird that like half
the people are dead where are all the
dead bodies this is those black pens or
body bags the cops come in occasionally
and these people are still just dance
yeah well you know nobody's eating my
poisoned food I'm very disappointed oh
look at that creepy guy coming isn't it
oh is that a rival murderer where I'm at
where my other which one are you rich
the one with a circle around oh oh yeah
that's it who's that guy yeah
Oh No Oh your there's a guy there shit
oh they got you now oh shit
what a weird concept for a game yes yes
it is oh yeah they just arrest other
people if they don't see you you're here
you must have done it how we kill these
fuckers eat this I poison that food eat
that food Eden oh wait one broke away
broke away right middle you just got to
pick them off as they break away right
so sorry eventually just gonna be one
person on the dance floor side of the
screen oh oh that's that's just that's
just that's just right side of the
screen well oh you know I like looking
in this area I was breaking it up into
like 9 quadrants
hey baby that was kind of disturbing I
haven't gotten tired of the music yet oh
crap
nice nice trap I know you want it oh oh
you can just pick guys up yeah yeah
sleeping fix sleeping guys up okay can I
just throw him in the soup
oh he woke up in my hands
oh god run run stab him in run oh oh oh
they got you they saw ya they got you oh
that was good that was close for a
sleeping cocksucker
well next time don't throw them in the
sewer or stab him first bus did okay
those won't try no no I uh we know well
if we have any chance of beating this
level I think you're our only hope
you've never even tried yeah I'm gonna
go through a learning curve again oh
there's a gun up there now
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo you can break the
trees some of this thing what does that
mean oh there's a fire I think we
started that fire
yeah I did start her
oh why I was there panic though somebody
died over here I don't know why it's an
unrelated down yeah yeah I guess we're
game
yeah it's parties sometimes people just
die sometimes the entire party dies oh
my god oh you killed all the
firefighters yay
I killed the firefighters I think so how
did I do that with the tree oh they in
the fall they were in the bedroom
good yeah you did good you think I saw
you know they didn't see you get away
from the bodies get away anybody's
officer you need to see this
the bodies by me
the old bodies by me
whoops to do upside she found an awful
mysterious trap
oh is that what it is yeah there was a
bear trap in that other game the leek a
hue like view cabin Lakeview cabin you
know bear traps I think video games
think that bear traps are more common
thing than they are there's somewhere in
the world where bear traps are an
everyday thing oh I'm sure several
places places with high bear populations
I don't guess bear traps are great bear
traps
somebody dressed like Ronald McDonald
yes yes it is we have to kill them okay
burn it what fire the cops aren't onto
you until the handcuffs are over your
head bTW there's a lady with a heart
over again
she wants to smooch that guy on the
computer there's no interest no that's
very that lady smooches why did this way
this man sleeping in the room that just
burned down have you never been to a
house party before there are people
laying everywhere when when you're at a
house party
you just you find a place that no one
else is sleeping on and you sleep on it
that's how it works
or you pass out or you passed out
there's a boat level nothing absolutely
nothing
I think bodies oh you killed a cop
wait how do I do that with the trap you
laid
oh the fire exception I'm so clever
fuck man you kill the clap being there
as a body just did it
just hit it now these cops keep showing
up and they find these bodies and they
just allow the party to continue they're
very incompetent
they do very very important body bags
and then just leave them at the party
yep my dad's I'm here this game is not
very realistic
that's fine about that that's it I'm
calling the cops that guy yeah dance it
now yeah yeah and I think your guy is
wearing a hockey mask
by the way ah so he is just as this
party wearing a hockey mask if somebody
else dressed like Ronald McDonald yeah
this shit happens who is a costume party
doo doo doo doo
you can't leave but I'm yeah yes you can
but you just oh all right yep
casual casual casual murder yeah oh I
can't what did I get away with that
no how did I get away with everyone
who's watching I guess everybody's
partying hard already such things
whenever you've made a calf the next one
will be coming down here no right now
I'm just hiding in this corner all right
I don't know I'm stronger even means hey
where's your sewer no no yeah you can
always hide bodies and garbage cans
quick tip hey fatty
yummy hey go good boy good boy
fatty have you seen my donut huh I got
this donut over here
speaking of donuts is that your big
weird pastry in the fridge I take by
your face so that it doesn't know
there's a big weird pastry in the fridge
and I've no idea where it came from how
long has it been there I don't know I
just noticed that today pastry I don't
know what it is or where it came from
it's there or elsewhere well rich if you
get really hungry there was a mysterious
big weird pastry if you're feeling
adventurous feeling somebody oh oh no oh
and you messed up she's gonna finger you
know if you're busted you got to run
away anyway oh are you kidding me I'm
too old for this
oh my god that word no wait you a
plumber he's just like Maria Oreo oh my
god he punches you back though
oh you can't stab them you can't oh why
can't you stab him because he's ma react
apparently Mario fights back
look ed the owner if he fights back if
you stab him like that should still
count for something
well then he just loses he's just there
to take away the thing I was using to
get away is that it maybe no I think
he's like hunting you know me to the
thing but the thing no that was him like
kicking and punching you look he's like
he's after you yeah
nope now he's distracted yeah just
blocked my exit Oh what the hell he went
down the toilet went into my boy Mario
like Mario Mario doesn't go into this oh
you like pipes
he doesn't go into pipes but there are
pipes and tunnels too hey I know what if
you go he's a plumber what do you think
he does I was fucking in here that was
weird you know what that was the
weirdest thing that happened to this
game so far is this a new game I think
so
you wish I think August
oh there you go still not tired of the
music I think I could listen to excel
have fun and repeat forever I'm going in
waves
maybe maybe vary it up with the Fletch
theme it's the same guy but did it so
it's similar but slightly different it's
very similar harold faltermeyer i think
it's the guys name did you sabotage the
gun yep hey dude three people
oh no so wait how many people are left
three five
before I'm assuming you have to kill the
DJ too right maybe no no all right yeah
