security gates before she died she told

while Joker in the safe explosion Harley
Quinn has the warden and he's the only
chance we have to get past these gates

and I remember this freak him out and
get him moving
I wrapped the door nothing here
I just want to get him I want to get him
away from like they heard they're
bunching up it's being a dick now just
being a bat dick sure came from over
there

punch I need more dick punch
anything else I can throw this at
yourself oh good well at least I got
their attention now
okay
huh
that did not go well and a bit someone
finish him off I wanted to hang down
someone for a little hang time
that's not how you do it hey someone how
bad baby up off the floor
okay I have completely forgot I forget
completely forgotten how to do the self
section you heard that right
okay well we got one at least we got one
terrible we got one crazy sloppy okay
yeah listen we're a little sloppy we're
a little rusty a little Batman rusty
tonight you know it's not great jack he
didn't know how to do the stealth
sections in the first place you fumbled
your way through them and it was
beautiful to watch well great
now you've seen me fumble my way through
this I technically won so yay me count
that as a win
oh no rich you're here hold on hold on
rich hold your horses
I see I see that I see that rich is on I
am working on it I am working on it
rich rich events he's been here for five
minutes I've been playing Rache Rache
Evans are you doing without me how have
I been doing without you have you been
watching me play Batman it's been
terrible just just for a little bit I
had the hardest time even logging on to
Trish oh okay they apparently forced me
to change my password Oh
like it wasn't letting me log on I tried
my old password like 50 different times
yeah so I went you know it's a decent
passwords a nine it was a nine character
long password had two numbers and two
different capital letters right that was
fine normal and I was forced to change
it and they they didn't accept anything
short of a 30 character long password
yes a fucking joke no you don't need
that if somebody really wants to hack
passwords they're gonna find a way to do
it anyway forcing a ridiculous password
is just going to make my life
inconvenient
no no even with like cracking software
they say like with every other digit it
adds like hours to the cracking out
algorithm for you know for my goddamn
twitch account what's something to do
watch videos under my name I would
rather be I would rather be able to
remember my goddamn password rather than
have a fucking list with with paragraphs
that are my passwords to different
websites sure I want these things to be
relatively easy to remember especially
if it's not anything where they can get
like financial data look like a fucking
twitch who the fuck cares sure sure
and I'd like password management
software yeah that just seems like a
great place to have somebody hack all of
your passwords at once I don't want to
use one of those I mean they're great
and it's big you know you can't then you
can't log on to your shit like another
computer you don't even know what your
own passwords are yeah fuck all of that
fuck all of that no it's great it's
great it's great and you're crazy so I'm
feeling a little bit better
rage helps the rage helps yeah I was
feeling really sick yesterday I could
not I could not keep down food yeah I'm
sorry yeah people were telling me I
should get my rest but I got a lot of
rest you order today that happened that
happened
oh you calling Batman I'm playing Batman
I'm fighting now and all of my hand of
faith practice has really helped me
figure out what I'm doing in Batman
except for one day I get up guns
I play Batman I get a yeah I'm not gonna
not gonna say I'm the best ever to play
Batman Arkham or whatever but I think
I'm decent at the game don't you idiots
that's my favorite is when they're just
like stop punching everyone not doing
great I'm not killing it
I suppose it's like Batman you're not
killing it ever but you play these games
obviously he kills people I don't think
he likes to pretend they're unconscious
but when you when you do that to a man's
spine he's he's not gonna be okay he
might live
technically sure he's alive but he's
spending his days being spoon-fed
applesauce okay all right back to the
mission back to the mission at hand I
played a little bit before this I played
a little heavy bullets which is a very
strange game
what is that evil what's it's a first
person shooter roguelike first-person
shooter roguelike that has like very
trippy graphics and the the selling
point the gimmick behind it is that you
your bullets are heavy and so you get
six bullets in your gun and after you
shoot them you need to pick up your
bullets to use them again
yeah which yeah that was quite fun okay
a little um
some strange little strange and the
visuals got a little a little sickening
hmm know what overall is good fun
go around
oh I just beat up someone in Detective
Mode that's fine most of most of this so
far has just been remembering how to
play Batman it's the first time you've
played it since the last room yeah
practicin new games coming out I know
probably doing episode on that I mean we
probably should I'm very worried about
it I want to like it yeah I haven't I'm
failing the series I haven't liked
origin and ever'one bitches about origin
but everything I've seen in the previews
for the new one that's not gonna feel
like I don't give a shit about the
fucking brothel girl I don't even want
to fucking that we'll be able to be in
the game but the ads the ads of all and
battlefield battlefield battlefield
battlefield take action Batmobile take
tank Batmobile I want I want stealth and
fighting because it's fucking Batman
Arkham game that's what I want I don't
want a fucking combat the 1980s hurry to
thank game right
get out of here I hit I hit my counter
button oh I am sucking rich overtime you
can't you can't hit the these shock
baton dude it can't hit them okay
can't hit the shock baton people so you
use your your roll away
my problem is timing my counters how
does Batman not kill people with a a
missile tank how does that how is there
no collateral deaths with that vehicle
Batman would never have a bat tank you
wouldn't I think it's a fair question
rich that's a fair question like how
does he not kill people with like power
battle armor you know you know like if
you punch these poems look started to
write it's gonna be completely
superficial but I'm gonna be annoyed the
whole game because Batman looks fucking
retarded and all of the ads for Rob
Arkham Knight
well it's superficial Thank You Batman
but God would like it it's also like
that's what you're looking at if it's an
ugly thing that happens part of the game
experience move them away from here as
soon as you can
I know take him to the man I know you
know it's the safest place on the island
okay I know what's gonna annoy me the
whole game sure sure
all right where am I going again I'm
going this way
I'm batmanning Boston technicolor says
Richard looks like he's destroying
things with no people in them
well how fucking convenient invents a
bat tag and the criminals just have to
be using robot vehicles to fight him
without fucking convenient
he says I you hit like an old man that's
what he said to me rich
oh yeah they said I hit like you it like
an old man well they're wrong you're
you're gonna break a spine yeah well I
just knocked I played this game you're
gonna break a spine the promise the
promise photos of me make next ones

I wasn't expecting out tonight anyway
because I wasn't gonna see jackals right
it's me sick me sick or not we usually
don't physically get together for the
sunday streams right maybe Tuesday yeah

rich I mean I'm the way you look at the
crazy people yeah I just got into the
crazy people thing what is it is an
insane asylum to shame you you should be
more shocked you haven't seen more crazy
people cuz you you pretty much just run
across cops and Joker's henchmen that
that's right right the asylum should be
filled with all sorts of different
non-affiliated crazy people actually
actually coming up shortly
yeah you're gonna you're gonna you're
gonna see a bad villain cameo villain
cameo
that's exciting I know there's no boss
battle or anything it's just there's
just there's a cameo coming up and it's
a little bit subtle
okay I like it I have to try to figure
it out or you're gonna you're gonna I'll
point it out but it'll be in play it
she'll probably say oh damn IV really
not interested no that's not it either
I'm just saying outfit come on let's uh
show a little subtlety here just stay
where you are
last thing I need is you running free
holy crap she is wearing no clothes just
just see oh oh you can see her hair in
detective mode then you'll see in a
second okay that's weird
have you have we been seeing other
people's hair one day one did Ivy stop
being human that's it that's a modern
thing that's that's like a that's a I
blame I blame Chris Nolan like trying to
trying to rationalize it scientifically
what her not being human yeah earlier
than Christopher Nolan that was just the
Jews game the general is game oh sure I
just I always I always associate him
with like the downfall of just people of
comic book superhero stuff when
originally she was just like a botanist
who knew all kinds of exotic plant right
wasn't that the original deal with ivy
you know she does she always had toxic
blood you know that was always the thing
by the way you're in the the cameo role
I'm in the cameo room it's going it's
going to we're going to scantily clad
lady cut scene right now
oh and cutscene the poison ivy and yeah
Harley damn girl okay oh here we go
all the crazies got out now uh-oh didn't
think that was gonna happen
nope didn't see that coming tonight okay
hold on I'm looking for a cameo to have
to cut him free first man that it's not
in that little room okay it's downstairs
it's useless
your terminal has been destroyed give me
the sequencer what oh yes of course
there's like a bitch on Batman's face
where it's like his Battle Damage it
looks it looks too wet he's sweaty oh my
god there's like an order 1886 thing
happening right now it's like a close-up
closeup of my hands
he always know what the Arkham games
actually did that first I don't know
that you control the movement like you
do in the order but know the Arkham game
we've always done that get a new gadget
he looks at it for a bit
right
Oh son of a bitch what what I can't get
out of the theme room well obviously you
have to use the new gadget you heard it
yeah but I couldn't find like I couldn't
find a terminal thing I was down the
stairs already and I was trying to use
it on the gate oh oh
the terminal was on - I figured it hey I
figured it out once you get cameo is to
the left
well there's someone here who is the
streamer exactly before before you go
upstairs he looked just like the warden
no he looks like she Oh before that
before that he looked like one of the
other guards cash ah he does like this
that great that's really fun that makes
a perfect amount of sense
oh yeah and look you can see how like
the mud and stuff in his room in this
place I'm talking to him right now
oh how creepy oh oh oh oh he just I
looked away and he changed oh he did
yeah I looked away now he's Commissioner
Gordon also it does randomize okay I
thought it just did one change I've
never noticed it doing it multiple times
that's great oh let's see what happens
maybe it's always random maybe that's
why I thought he was the warden first
maybe that's that's great
hey I didn't even know that yeah that's
fun
what's up here I can jump oh that's
creepy well I was just one of the
inmates afraid
no no he's like he's still in one of the
cages yeah that's got to be a developer
or something I'm not sure I think I just
came up when I eat when I tried to
stream this game once I think I might
have been like somebody who wanted
contest alright we're here we're here
