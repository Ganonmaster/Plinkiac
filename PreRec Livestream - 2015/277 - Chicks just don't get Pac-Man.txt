Rich: Oh, fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. 
Karin: Taco Bell was the best dog food available in the chain restaurant. Have just seen dog food lately? I mean, like, quality dog food. My mom gets the dog these little, like, Tupperware containers full of, like, dog food that, I haven't tried any, but it looks and smells like actual food. It's got, like, recognizable chunks of chicken and, like, peas and stuff in there. It's like little, little shelf staple TV dinners for dogs. And I guess you're supposed to feed a whole one to a small dog, but he's a large dog, so she just puts part of it on. 
Rich: He still stole your sandwich. 
Karin: Yeah, he still stole my sandwich. The other day, I closed my eyes, or turned my back, I left the room for a minute. I come back, and my dog has eaten my whole sub. He's just running away from me with a jog going real fast.
Rich: Oh, fuck. Fuck. Back! Oh, god! Woo-doggy! 
Karin: That's kind of what I said. 
Rich: No, no, no! I'm fucked, I'm fucked, I'm fucked, I'm fucked! Oh, I did it! I survived! I fucking survived! Look at the, look at the traps in there. Fucking survived.
Karin: Stop screaming. Relax. Relax. 
Rich: That was amazing. That was amazing.That was fucking great. 
Karin: Wow. I didn't know somebody could have an orgasm for playing Pac-Man.
Rich: Fuck...you...
Karin: I'm kidding.
