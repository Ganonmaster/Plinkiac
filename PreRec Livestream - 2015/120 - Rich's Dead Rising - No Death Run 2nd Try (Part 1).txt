how the hell are you guys in here right
now
I didn't tweet anything else out I just
all I did was change the name of the
room of the stream or whatever oh my god
that's unbelievable
hello hello yes there is a secret stream
I feel like attempting a know a death
run on Dead Rising
yet again trying this yet again and make
sure this yeah yeah we're streaming out
this is live this is live this is going
to be a fairly quiet stream because this
is going to be a dead identity PUD very
funny a dead serious attempt at a true
ending which is the you know the harder
ending to get no death run of dead
rising to starting from scratch while
saving as many people as I possibly can
so yeah I'm gonna start I'm maybe not
gonna talk that much this son but I mean
you know watch your dumb chat amongst
yourselves whatever
right
last time I died at the second Carlito
fight I don't know
Anna how familiar either of you guys are
with the game the two people here right
now uh for for history's sake cooks
psychosis and space vagrant but I died
on the second carlito fight which is fun
he attacks you with a sniper rifle and
it's difficult because you know I'm
starting from scratch didn't have much
of a mystery I smell I've rethought my
strategy this time I'm going to bring
quick steps I'm gonna be got a tip
making a lot more a quick step in
general quick step is one of the big
strengths you can make energy wonders
that makes you move a lot faster
freelance pal wasn't waiting for the TV
to tell me what to cover
here she is my license tempus is alright
Colorado populace alright I managed to
save everyone I possibly could but wait
up wait way too much time the only thing
to do in this town is kill time at the
shopping mall what I love about this
game is how how stringent the time
limits are if if you don't want to save
as many people as you can
yeah looks like taking the helicopter
was the way to go you're willing to let
people die all the roads blocked off by
now
you can save more people all right
listen
he has nothing has shots of the whole
town before the National Guard finishes
roping it off if she don't take me over
the Main Street just for my own sake you
guys might be here in double audio but
I'm hearing sound that up delay so I'm
turning up the TV volume a bit which is
probably gonna pick up on this this
microphone I'm using sorry about that
but I need to hear what's going on this
is serious business
and I'm going to have to adjust chem
controls
and did that after this helicopter dead
I'm not I'm not skipping this because i
can i can earn a lot of free points just
from these photos you know me i don't
ever skip cutscenes anyway
well you hearing are you hearing an echo
in the game right now because I just
turned the okay good I'm kind of shocked
this mic isn't picking it up this is a
pretty good mic
this is what you can to take pictures
more comfortable I don't need the stupid
headphones at all
Hopa some what I'm doing take take good
pictures take better pictures as you can
you get more points taking pictures when
the action happens
boy everybody just walking in
how am i doing I'm doing great
I have no idea one thing for sure
whatever is going on down there it's not
business
lobster gun thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it
it's true we do
I would build the faggot spike if a
spiked bat if this were dead rising
through this is Dead Rising 1 so I do
not have that option that Dead Rising 2
was the cookie one with them with the
combo weapons this is the one with a
stringent time limit since more
difficult yet more satisfied
sure the one knows but now but I am a
bigger fan of dead rising not one
good
person asking in the chat the first try
I got to the the second card legal fight
which I have I have other strategies in
mind
this is yeah this was a xbox 360
exclusive so the PlayStation this is on
PlayStation nothing
yeah no I know I missed the explosion
last time that really fucking pissed me
off though I could have been centered
better on the explosion but is where it
is
I was not taking a picture which does a
gun Adam
they invested my knowledge this game has
never been released on anything but the
xbox360 and if there's a secret
PlayStation release just just out of
curiosity let me know about it
curious
I'm 1 1 1 1 I want to see battery of
town take me there
I'm glad you enjoyed Karin during the
last street lesser God I'm glad you
enjoyed her she enjoyed doing the stream
I'm sure she'll be she'll be around from
time to time
oh god yeah
lobster cut I remember the weed release
hey shop co-driver me on the rooftop but
they should have called that game Dead
Rising for zombie choose me man you are
nuts
all right listen up don't forget to come
back for me as long as you're not dead
Fred its Frank Frank West remembers I
ain't 92 in three days thank you for
subscribing
we really appreciate six-month whoa
just bite down to that rooftop
shootout for this one
we're going down perfect dark thank you
for ceramic we really appreciate three
months in a row
hello there you're the reporter aren't
you yeah you came along
yeah I'm freelance you know that's you
know only does I know but people are
starting to pour in now this might be so
stream might be white on me talker
Inglis this is a this is a serious you
know dick run attempt that I just
figured I'd stream for back of it why
not you see from this why not you gotta
do it anyway
wine extremely well if it were just a
riot I doubt the military would
quarantine the entire area the
moratorium on information getting out is
a little extreme see Lucas I know you
check randomly but we just uh we I just
start can't put my finger on Zoe and
wind when I die so we'll see how long
this lasts
doesn't sound like civil disobedience
it's - yeah justjust just heads up the
stream ends when I die almost as if
everyone's already dead
yeah
so why don't you just tell me already
what's going on
I think you'd better see for yourself
yes I am going for the the the the good
ending the perfectly the true ending
whatever you want Colin and I'm also
going to try and save as many people as
possible one because I'm a hero goddamn
it and secondly so I can level up too
but mostly because I'm a hero god damn
it I like saving people in games yeah if
you feel like you're showing up late if
I if I skip the intro cutscene stuff
basically the game would just be
starting right now right here anyway yes
frequence plead actually you take
pictures of like boobies and whatnot
held it nosebleeds it's silly they don't
so kind of like a Japanese thing I think
ha nosebleeds equal equal lust or
something that were there weird like
that
what in the world
how long would I know less how long they
know deathrun last pretty a fairly long
time I think it's longer than I thought
I don't remember if basically have to
survive for three in-game days and then
if you get the good in and that's a
little bit longer yet spoilers and I
don't remember if a day is too real
hours or three-rail hours so we could be
here a while you're not you're not
obligated to say I mean you could you
could just leave and come back or just
leave oh that's fine I understand
there's no guarantee I'll make it
through the whole fucking thing anyway
I'll probably fuck up at some point
hey bring that over here
around
sweetie donkey Oh where's my Madonna
I will not be using the Mega Buster
because I specifically want to start low
one so this is not using any kind of
previous save this game thinks it's
especially rush late I didn't want to
last time because it was so quickly
sheep but I'm gonna do it this time I am
probably going to abuse the mini
chainsaws I hate saying that but at
least for the boss sites fights and I'm
gonna use those button incest now and
I'm gonna feel dirty when I do it look
on the bright side
zombie says dirty stupid and slow we
should be safe in here
alright then be like making yourself
useful take a look around the mall bring
anything we can use for the barricade
back here on doing Oh
pronto I know I know the mini chainsaws
are legit there than that actually
they're not actually cheating but it
feels like it it feels like it those
things are so imbalanced alone that's so
weird no right now I got a divert myself
and every game I play I got to tell the
Xbox that
fantastic
not bad not bad all right last time I I
know I I took pictures of all the
survivors cuz I thought maybe cuz I
don't care about achievements but I
figured maybe along with the achievement
I would get prestige points to level up
and it doesn't look like I did so I'm
probably not gonna bother this time
you stop right there
do you have any idea what you've done
why did you summon me to this place what
are you planning what something
something I don't even know if I'm gonna
buy because huh everything was fine and
now my end
this way this is where I fucked up and
died
going for the chakra
what in the hell are you people doing
quick move get over here
everyone move this way quick to the
stairs
all about
by their turn tutorials often
Alister o98 fucking waste fucking waste
of a picture
bad
the bandpass horse no I know I can get
pictures in the 1000 the Jews Abby's
food our water oh I got the shotgun
hold on hold on get out at one time
that's more like it either butter
that's okay okay good good fantastic
you can attack zombies just with this
but when you're not level then that
isn't very effective near the end of the
game
barehanded if you can be kind of beastly
right now I am NOT you kind of need a
weapon
early on it again fantastic
fantastic
well
and what I'm doing here is I can get
some decent pictures in this first
section and I'm trying to level my Frank
up and my strategy is to level up
quickly as I can the higher my level the
easier the later sections of the game
get
then past
and
fantastic
you would front down it from other side
they say I am going for a near perfect
run I don't think I'm gonna save
everybody
fantastic
fasting
we'll be done farming in a second one
more one more
huh
is there a limited amount of time I look
at my favor can you just keep taking
pics so the score bottoms out no uh I
don't know you uh you only have like I
hope they got three shots in your camera
before you need to find batteries for
your camera
as long as those things are in the mall
we'd better not use this door what are
you doing hey yeah I know I know I was
farming there but we're working towards
a goal here everybody we need to do this
and apparently those things I need your
inspiration and help if this is going to
succeed be a factor wait a minute you
want to get back in there what for hey
hey
nice camera are you a photographer as a
matter of fact I am Frank West
photojournalist could you show me some
pictures frame
you really seem to know what you're
doing who are you guys anyway and what
are you I took that one near the
entrance that guy do something
nope thanks for showing me though
hey we're not done talking yet just who
are you guys
I'm Jesse the man you saw earlier is
Brad that's all I'm authorized to tell
you
right
after listened oh just actually I need
to go back to that room I need to grab
some coffee creamer
because it's part of my my revamp
strategy
coffee creamer which is clearly
chocolate milk
I really need some inventory slot
upgrades here don't I
Hey anybody around no nobody's around
talk to me Jeff let's get this over with
don't don't run from me I'm here to help
all right
get you and your wife back to the
security room on our way mister
fantastic
come on
yeah
come on over there
hurry up Natalie
Oh get out away any shot of that vent
fantastic
alright I'd rather desperately need
inventory space there's other upgrades
er no I did get one oh good it's got it
yes alright don't give map before I
forget save that one for later
will be necessary
shut up Louis Yuda let you finish
talking for the next cutscene trigger so
I don't have to take that call against a
shop finish
zombies huh had a feeling you'd show up
Oh God it's you look don't sneak up on
me
Brad was attacked I located him on the
monitor oh it's probably just a sprain
I've gotta help Brad or he's done for
all right fine give me your gun come on
I'm the reason you just got hurt let me
help
no I can't let a civilian do that that's
against regulations yeah well I don't
think they had zombie infested malls in
mind when they wrote those regulations
kid you know how to use this kinda I've
covered wars you know
look after I'm through helping you you
and I are gonna have a nice little chat
all right now
last time I'm saying this from the
stream first started but not everyone
was here then last time I didn't know
death run I died on the second Carlito
fights well he's a sniper rifle Adam I
had trouble getting close without
getting shot
so my revised strategy is to make some
quick step which makes you temporarily
run faster which is why I needed that
coffee creamer
it's coffee creamer which is Java milk
and orange juice makes fix them
and I figure this might come in handy
other places too so I'm not just
grabbing it for the section for that one
fight I mean
I presume the skateboards faster
oldest you can tell me later
yeah a no dinner this wouldn't be easy
if I just like stayed in the security
room for seven everything but I have
ended up doing that work we're going for
the good ending hmm Jesse and his mini
Peter saved as I can okay we'll have to
talk about this later you know how to
use that gun I've never fired at a
person
all right I'll cover you from here you
need to stick to the shadows try to get
close to the target okay and what am I
supposed to do when I get close well the
best solution would be to shoot the guy
but if you can't do that keep them busy
dodging your bullets and stay out of
trouble
are you up to it I'm a lot better with a
camera but yeah I'll give it a shot
all right
next time you reloads I'll lay down a
suppressing fire I'm counting on you
make your way over there one two three
this I hate me I hate you of us everyone
hates you die
you I hate all this hate everybody in
this game doesn't even Frank West or
Isabella
this fight sucks
I'm on a clock here Carlito
I got a lot to do before sunset I can't
fuck around with you all day
he got away you notice how Carlito runs
out of cover to load his gun no well
thanks for your help the name's Brad
I'm Frank West photojournalist and right
now I'd rather have an explanation than
your thanks Brad sorry
I've got nothing to tell you
look
I don't know what Jesse told you but as
far as I'm concerned we're through
working together so you cover your
zombie story and leave the rest to us
you uh you guys are looking for someone
here aren't ya
who is that where did you help me I help
you
damn you one hell of a journalist aren't
you Frank a hot-headed underhanded
hotshot paparazzi with nothing better to
do than to invade people's privacy I try
you got a point
you win Frank
let's work together
Jesse and I are DHS agents and yes we
are looking for the man in that picture
you're with Homeland Security is that
guy a terrorist or something
and took that picture in the entrance
Plaza right near the front door
the entrance Plaza you're sure
hey so do I have your permission to
cover this story or not
Ratna wish run through these guys you
know you know better
Oh
just get the little swish alright that
kind of way
something I should play the new Dead
Rising 3 I've heard nothing but bad
things and it looks boring and it
doesn't have Frank West Chuck Greenwood
shows up again and home well I love
Chuck rain Chuck green was the main
character Dead Rising 2
he's the boring sir he's that bad I
don't just kind of he come with us we
can rap he's just kind of boring care
I'm not believing this character is
summed up then he hasn't it's gotta save
his daughter Frank is interesting cuz
he's just kind of a sleazy paparazzi and
he gets in over his head
well what happened you can't just arrest
him he turned down my offer to protect
him said he isn't going anywhere until I
can guarantee a secure route out of here
oh I know I know all about Dead Rising 2
AMA
rescue it starring frequent you didn't
raise the coop record as the Dead Rising
2 uh like kind of like director Scott
only they switched out the main
character it's this guy in off the
record I know I have it
but right now I'm bound and determined
to do it no death row enough for
beginning on dead rising nom 1
I'm sure I will stream off-the-record at
some point not right now though
what happens if I fill then I'll try
again at some point I I think I've done
it before I don't know if I've done it
before starting from loving one though
there we go that's what I want
yeah
what if I'm never able to do it I am
confident that I am able to do this back
back in the day I knew this game like
the back of my hand I'm not saying I'm
not saying I'm back there yet I'm not
saying I'm gonna succeed tonight but I
know I can do it I know I know in my
heart I can do it

Aaron didn't manage to get himself
killed
that's fuckin great
damn
technically the world isn't coming to an
end in a zombie apocalypse the these
zombies at least in this game are
limited to one single town this is all

think Colorado rest of the world zombie'
free

and of course Aaron is the the last one
damnit
hmm so that's what dr. Barnaby said huh
the old coots not dumb he wants us to
call for help first so we got a line out
or what
the signals being blocked
I can't even contact HQ on the emergency
line so if we want to get our hands on
dr. Barnaby we're gonna have to secure a
way out of here ourselves all right
we've got to deal with the situation
we've been handed the boneheads back at
HQ might be working on something too
there's a helicopter coming three days
from now at noon it's my ride is you're
right reliable absolutely that's how I
plan on getting out of here all right
then I'll see to it that the DHS picks
up the Charter speech
can we take dr. Barnaby as well sure as
long as you tell me what's going on okay
I'll tell you what you want to know
later we have more pressing business
right now if we have to wait here for
three days we'll need supplies water
blankets on the light we'll get dr. Barr
to be here tomorrow morning I want you
to keep an eye on the monitors
yeah
stock up all right good good
so you guys talking about Resident Evil
and the chap dead dead rising is my
zombie game of chess
Oh
rich rich is playing which is the only
one here
yeah here we go
yeah
follow me oh wait Oh
is this a secret bonus stream I felt
like doing a rising Doge death run again
so I figured why not why not stream it
come on so everybody going he done wait
over there
follow me
I understand fantastic I'm taking this
picture for the Kent storyline you need
AE rakla
picture of at least 750 points which got
right there that's taken care of
don't worry about that
fuck
drop that shot girls like that
I think I'm doing pretty good on time
I'm doing something a lot different than
I usually do I usually save bill Aaron
well consider guys Berks Sophie and lay
all of us and the convicts kitty cause
the convicts that huge group is always a
pain in the ass so doing something a
little bit different this time and I
think it's working out I think I'm doing
just as good on time as I normally would
to just because it's very hard to get
done through the park
what all skills do I have unlocked right
now dodge kicked alright alright alright
right to the door I need to close
oh we run out right then
Janice
Wow
what system has the most number of bad
games and be the Atari 2600 damn near
all of them
and this is why I brought food
I got away I need to get out of here
oh you're welcome for the surprise
stream I just hope you don't mind that
I'm not talking that much because I'm
all business all business
Oh
it's a little slow of course the clock
though all right we can do this
have waited for the shark to throw from
the crisis wait
cyber bitch
I'm gonna kill you first
they killed my favorite survivor damn
them
there's no way I'm gonna have enough
people for the saint chief like I'm
really going for achievements but I do
walk save even feel it back there that's
not gonna happen that because of the
convicts but I'm probably not gonna be
afraid to sacrifice some other people
now if I absolutely have to I guess I
guess that's a good thing
all right well I'm sad that I lost Leigh
she is my favorite because even though
she's purple typically if you just set
her down on her own and go to do
something else she's she's fully capable
of holding her own she'll she can handle
the group of zombies that late yeah
but right now I got a are myself for I
Adam I'm grabbing one heavy hit weapon
this year's sledgehammer and then I'm
gonna make sure I grab maybe the frying
pan something that I can swing a bit
kicker a quick kicker quicker fucking
lost late god dammit god dammit I feel
so bad she lost her baby her sweet baby
and now she's dead
oh I'm gonna get those convicts we're
gonna avenge late that's not gonna be
run away I'm still on the weak side of
things doesn't this game have a time
limit or some bullshit this game
definitely has a time limit and it's not
bullshit it's what makes this game great
look the way the game set up if you
don't care about the story if you just
want to have fun killing zombies you can
ignore any any kind of story base time
run whatever and just have fun but if
you do want to follow a story god the
time limit makes it so intense
with the palm is giving you nightmares
story I got I got this plum I'm locked
down nothing to fear
beat Adam but
yeah
miss penny fuck your spin attackdon't mind me I'm just gonna eat all
your food
you're wondering what Adam did that was
wrong there's actually he is a hostage
on that roller coaster I'm just saving
these guys first then I'm gonna go back
to the roller coaster and save the
hostage
I owe you one fantastic yeah

hand here what what gives
considering the helicopter and all we
have to work together
but that doesn't mean we can tell you
everything and everything we do tell you
can't necessarily be printed yeah so so
I just want you to appreciate the
situation well we're up to our night I
have not seen Maggie I've seen the
trailers fine and it looks good it looks
nothing like an Arnold Schwarzenegger
movie though which is a good thing I
still can't believe all this you know I
think that's not a good there's plenty
of Exodus Tony a good classic movies but
I mean I didn't think he had it in him
to do something that actually looked
like drama you all right there yeah I
got it
you should rest a while Brad
you go ahead and catch some sleep first
we can switch in four hours okay
yeah
yeah oh my throw power went up well
that's that's terribly useful
oh I still got that Japanese book why
didn't I put that down earlier oh well
live and learn
live and learn
yes actually
elevator music going on I still got that
in my head dead undead and under
what twitch twitch said it was off one
map twitches twitches line I've been
I've been successfully so far
yeah
you haven't come back for this summer
right interrupted shits going down for
real
I like to think that after this game
Frank Frank tracked
Otis down and murdered him I like to
think that's a thing that happened it's
a zombie apocalypse you care about phone
etiquette
look mister if we're gonna fight these
zombies we need guns electrician named
zombies bad as far as I can throw that's
just people even less don't shoot
look pop this okay talk to my 12-gauge
don't get no closer to kingdom come
doc my 12-gauge situation like this
you
hey this fight I hate this fight so much
damn mister what are you crazy
you want you want good so bad
and so I have gone down the road of mini
chainsaw abuse though then again oh it's
- Cletus is a fucking power
all right
where's the next rescue area somewhere
that's a coffee creamer you've got
yourself there I'll be taking that
talk to me goddammit
then I have inventory room for the cream
oh well oh well
you know the best escorts are the ones
you need to carry you're carrying them
essentially makes you grab proof like
they took it easy on you when they
design those those little escort
missions like yeah that's hard enough
it's gotta carry a man the grabs will
work
I got some time to kill where the next
motion starts I might I might level off
by taking a picture taking tour of the
mall
yes this is a no deathrun attempt trying
to get the best ending possible I'm
already not going to save everybody
because lay or as the chat is telling me
lay off whatever was murdered by the
fucking convicts in the park and we get
my revenge on those guys at some point
follow me
Thanks
I make inventory slots fucking inventory
I got to drop something v I get more
shotgun so your fuck it I got to be
prepared for the coming days and that
requires coffee creamer
whoo
wannabes are thinning out must be
getting near morning I don't have to
translation magazines I got one magazine
for edged weapons which means the
chainsaw will last longer I'm holding
onto that book and the other book is for
more points for escort miss cherish I'm
going to be doing a lot home and I want
to hold on to that I don't want to time
can be tight in this game I don't want
to have to run back to the area where
that is to grab another one well the
next major place I gotta go is in the
move that neck of the woods
but I need are just more inventory slots
no one can kill any Carlito with the
chainsaw I'm gonna need I'm not gonna
need a sniper regular
it's got a fun weapon
who double area dice
perfect
yeah
fantastic
I know a lot of you are Resident Evil
fans so there's Jill sandwiches
fantastic
I'd love another inventory slot
fantastic
fantastic
what else down here is worth taking a
picture
I'm not sure
oops custom stuff
I can loosen Leia that pisses me off
almost almost perfectly round of the
game almost perfect but I gotta say
almost now because of those goddamn
convicts
wish I had the moves a Smasher the
suplexes all the fun stuff
our son for the next
a little bit
Oh
that's saved that's saved it's good I'm
not sure that was for enough points on
the Sophie picture for the kid mission
yeah 750 and everything is golden
stand outside wait for the call
or almost where I died last time
that can't be good
what's going on anyway before this whole
thing started someone called the
professor and told him to come to this
mall check the line did you so was this
the caller this guy here
they've got something to do with the
zombies don't they
they're the reason we came here and if
he gets away with dr. Barnaby
none of our questions will be answered
can't save
alright time for some heroics
on with the cheap manator we are going
to charge you to that
enough time for Otis's bullshit maybe a
difficult day ahead of us
don't be daydreaming out here
someone shooting from the floor above

horse in a zombie game I just
there's always Red Dead Redemption
undead nightmare

concentration is to go on into the game

you gotta be always fucking over there
don't ya
beginner's luck that's all let's have
one more just one more contest Frank be
here tomorrow at noon we'll settle this
what's Dead Rising 2 any word yet the
present is good it comes in two flavors
off-the-record in their own vanilla the
regular Dead Rising 2 stars a new main
character who's kind of a boring schmuck
then off the record stars this this
character of Frank West bass the same
basic game though they just changed the
main character and made some minor story
alterations I had time to cheese it up
you can't tell me actually no party
wasn't feeling off the record wasn't DRI
DLC and that was a whole standalone game
they sold Coverley I'm right aren't I
you are nothing but a you son by the
time I'm done beating information out of
you
and for death to come take you away Dead
Rising 3 cycles are based off the seven
deadly sins that just sounds retarded
oh yeah
Oh
testing
where's analyst address that
you over there
here take this when you guys talk about
the silent protagonist versus a talking
protagonist just done in but I'll take a
technical talks anytime I was think
silent protagonist are weird I heard her
scream people respond to you as if
you're saying things and you're not
hey I hated everything
white suddenly
unless your protagonist is like some
kind of Clint Eastwood to ask a badass
that just doesn't talk much it wasn't
over
and
yes even even link I don't hate link but
I prefer for typing protagonist
yeah
there's the dress
Oh

shotgun
