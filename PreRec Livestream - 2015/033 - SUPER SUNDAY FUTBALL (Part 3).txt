little too light for me but
I have not filled the donation box all
the way in rebirth as my save
constellated I'm just replaying now I've
finally got made some progress in both
my Steam version and my Vita version and
rebirth rich left rich left the room but
he's back now actually here's here's an
interesting thing yeah so I kicked off
yeah your guy caught it made a great run
yeah like but he was highlighted you
weren't you could not you didn't have to
touch it at all huh I wonder how I feel
about that badly
you should feel badly I felt badly about
that I wonder if we could literally just
both of us put the controllers down and
you have it Auto pick plays and just
watch a game being played we've been
playing this wall which is which
owner I'd not never know yes that's so
weird I think there are people who
actually play man sure sure and just let
the computer yappy hey I do yeah that's
fucked up there's accurate worth manat
yes this game was better than alien
isolation yes I enjoyed it it was fun
once I started understanding what it was
I was supposed to be doing and then like
figure out the strategy like oh I'll
trick rich in like I'll do a run here
right here then a pass no I I actually
really learned the basic football I've
learned basic football that's exactly
what I'm done I really enjoyed that
I think you know what I think we're
gonna play it again not tonight but just
in general oh that's fun okay here's
what we're gonna do we are gonna take a
little break um rich is gonna finish up
his chippies we're gonna run a
commercial and then we are gonna play
some FIFA 14 so we will be back
momentarily enjoy the pause menu of
madden 15

insane

my controller soon I'm out of one bar
one bar of love ooh you know I would not
go see a band called one bar of love
okay you're not obligated to no not
obligated to but the question is you
know like what stuff like that the
question is would you go see a band with
a name based solely on the name right
and there are something so I would 100%
go see based solely on their name one
bar of love is not one of those bands
just the right chord mean the right
chord yeah thank you

fifa14
Jim's father thank you for subscribing I
don't know who you are
Jim's father is Jim's father of course
yeah if there was a band called 12 years
to film I would look into them like if I
saw that a band called 12 years to film
was coming to them I'd be interested in
that 100% I wouldn't expect a regularly
scheduled for their albums no it might
be updating so it might just be one of
those things where again we just chat
wall it up the hits
oh that was the Nvidia control panel
sorry for having that on screen guys in
sports so now this is football this is
our football stream I've updated this
dream we are not playing the FIFA 14 as
you can clearly see there's some guy

guitar and I'm sure he's a very famous
footballer what do you what do you call
a soccer player afoot Oh Jim's father

You Michelle we're down I don't remember
that guy's name
come on now retching squeaking we came
to football game a chance we can do this
well it can't be any more boring to play
that is to watch snap I when I went to
go now you got oh my god and match and
match I went to I went to Africa to film
a video for the World Cup a couple of
years ago and I got to watch a World Cup
game in Africa with a million billion
screaming fans right and that still did
not excite me I knew nothing that was
happening people were aware people were
hooting and hollering like mad people
say one check now okay FC Barcelona okay
I got to be Paris I came to Barcelona
Real Madrid Manchester City Spurs board
Dortmund muon oh now we're back to all
the other ones um I like this logo the
best so I'm gonna choose Boer you're

there's numbers and I want to make my
numbers about equal to your number
what's that - five five stars right but
no your other numbers so like this one
oh oh sure Real Madrid is about equal
all right ready
so in any case like no soccer is a sport
that I really just have no no fucking
clue what's going on oh I'm gonna be oh
look at that what the fuck indeed Phil
Davis thank you for subscribing we very
much appreciate it for these past three
months all right I'm gonna more so Jack
is orange jack is real Madrid Barcelona
Barcelona okay okay okay press circle to
take a shot at the goal the longer you
hold the circle the harder your shot
will be in the higher shot will go use
the left stick to aim left and right
okay
oh this is me hey look I did it
what am I supposed to hit the target oh
I got one I got one
my first option button to play oh oh oh
you're supposed to do it from inside
here oh I get it we started oh great
what was that like a Victoria I I guess
okay
sorry everybody we don't quite know
what's happening we're working on it
okay here we go here we go here we go
here we go here we go
Circle kicks
finally boom circle cakes the square
circle cakes the square X passes
and nothing's happening nothing's still
happening boom
nope nope nope
I had it for a second
oh my god taking it in the end zone
I think there's a button the flap is
there button to flop them away just like
the game right okay I guess you get it
now
and punt you is there is there button to
follow Oh Oh nope get out of here
who's gonna be the highest-scoring game
of soccer ever rich did it apparently
that's great that's great
touchdown people love it rich look at
that go crazy I did update the stream
name you refresh your browser Super
Sunday football stream FIFA 14 I have
updated the stream name terrible defense
I guess I agree I don't know I don't
know
Lele Lele okay they changed dudes okay
that's how a square to change dudes how
the fuck do you people play this game I
have no idea what's happening
I'm managing oh I have the ball
no this is just disgusting to watch yeah
I'm gonna punch you I'm gonna punch it
that's extra punch oh that's out on you
that's out on you that's out on you okay
great
so what I'm saying my prediction is that
rich is going to operate this game your
prediction is kind of wrong
that is fast OOP oh good that's you
again that's great that's great news
okay we need to watch it chase the ball
down I mean I think that's part of the
fun I think that's part of the
experience
Oh
control here one congested midfield but
a little over long how's it a little too
long in a circle button right
oh I press the sphere Oh squares kicks
into the net oh you're the one who
scored a point I don't know how I did
that
maybe it's both I don't know should we
pause it and look at my button does whoa
oh yeah
oh I took it okay
it's over again okay I'm gonna flubbing
I'm flipping my kicks first quick second
why why why why I want to see why I want
to see what button does what why here
great Wyatt huh
why short pass header lob pass cross
header
what's a through ball um what's a
through ball circo's shoot volley header
trigger player on chip shot
chip shot a finesse shot Jesus a drew
what's a through ball I'm just gonna hit
bottom this one in there the net okay
straight things will happen I think it's
great this chippy it's got the REC
doubles through ball is a straight pass
what look at him he's all Jimmy Johnny
he's Jimmy Johnny you say funny things
boom and there's a Jolly Roger on that
rimjob rimjob oh that's perfect that's
great for me
through vol through the defense is what
they're saying
Oh didn't work
yes this is getting Schiphol a giblet oh
we've had some meds get lead inlets too
many go was on that log drop
okay I guess you get it now and now this
guy gets it passes it to that guy fuck
you gonna flop all over your ass but and
I get that oh fuck you I got a yellow
card fuck yeah fuck you sir what'd you
do you pressed a button
no I didn't huh no I didn't you can
operate the ps4 with your voice you
press the button I didn't press the
button I didn't press the button I
didn't press the button I did not press
the button
did the game crash no I still here what
the fuck this happened
I told me I didn't hit a button is it I
didn't hit a button is it because I told
the game to fuck off fuck you
get out of my giblets oh oh you have it
I thought I had it still she puts
giblets giblets but who did what that
was probably me what what what what you
did something rich
eating something bad and I got the ball
I think it was some kind of suckers off
side things doctor has offside I don't
they they have rules to keep the game
from getting too exciting I got it I got
mine now my ball now passes it to the
passer back to the jibber he's pasa the
pass has got us into many jobs it's
gonna go on the cross bummer
oh no get there you fuck you fuck with
mothers outs as regulation of apparently
offsides is a thing how do we know who's
offside when this is the this is my big
question I can make my guy fall down
does that help
I've learned how to make my guys Oh what
what happened what's going on I know
what happened but I have a timeout time
what does every defender then just stand
at like the halfway point that would
seem to make sense yeah yeah how come
that doesn't happen seems like a really
weird rule okay
oh right my boy
Oh every switch sides now yeah okay that
sounds okay no I got a Phil I got a
still no shit
the commentators are making fun of me
now
but here's my strategy rich it's wildly
shoot at the goldens just like real
soccer yeah this is my only strategy
boom my mouth
oh okay right to you that's fine no
that's fine what's he doing I don't know
they stole the ball for me again if that
helps
I need a better strategy right yes you
do
this mood to get away from the defender
it's not really going to get the better
of him from that range especially when
you can see it all the way
how the fuck do I not kick it over the
net this is my one quite hey I don't
know I always always kidding hitting bar
going far to the left over the net I
felt like that was a really good run a
lot of pass yeah a lot of the vial of
excitement until I had to fucking kick
it
oh by now yours now kickball I now know
who did I just fucking pass a tee well
apparently
leymah okay okay boom
boom boom bye now
but
doing a fucking rule just keep kicking
it to go what about going
don't press Oh too hard Jack this is my
parent Lee I'm giving it too much okay
here we go
but
all I'm doing is back in my guy's way
now because I don't know like what
offsides
I'm just kicking you that's fine that's
fine I think that was probably my phone
I'm taking you out
oh okay I'm just reading the chat
apparently you can if you have the ball
you can go behind the defense's but if
you can't just leave a guy back there
okay right to you that's fine that's
fine
all right if anything he stepped on me
so that's his fault because I yeah he
stepped on me this is look at that guy
covering his balls I love it
what's going on there I don't know okay
I think eyeball is doing things right
that are beyond my control I'm really
sorry about that guys I just itched my
chin on the microphone my chin is
ooh pepper you with the pepper give it
the pepper
mr. pepper give me at the pepper nope
too much pepper too much pepper
if you really need to stop pressing that
button i always go too fast you know
because they have played extremely well
he's away from his marker now
okay
did you see yo I did why because I
didn't get the G out and I was already
too busy talking that's Tim I was
writing it by the way I didn't I just
gently tap that the circle button
gently captain that's great that's great
sure great great yo Joe yes that was
great that felt great everything's great
home run stop pressing that button it's
so tempting for me to press that kick
everything button
looking good this much rich this movies
looking good oh thank you opening
gave 4j thank you for subscribing this
is your third month now
we very much appreciate it though my oh
no get it up there get it up there get

accident that's alright it's back on our
turf get out get out here okay okay good
good good good
it's gonna say how do they do the
tiebreaker then
no they have no type right now I should
have got a little closer my price should
have got a little bit closer before
trying to make the goal now this now
this is soccer you got a one one time
it's the most exciting thing in the
world what is it over now there's three
right no therefore no that's all that
was it
those it I guess we have options penalty
kicks golden goal I guess I think that's
sudden death
okay well then matches drama what's
classic I think why they don't keep
going
that's what is classic
I'm so bored sorry this is the European
stream we have to be nice to our
neighbors on the other side of the globe
who they're saying penalties due
penalties okay I will do penalties sure
you were doing this how do you do this
do you want to hit the ball when it's in
the green oh I didn't know I didn't do
this one whether it was in the green but
it's an NBA ball situation is near for
12 yards everybody thinks he should
score there's a lot of pressure on him
what the fuck penalty

worry about this which one of us cannot
fuck out at least mine is going near
what is that wrote orrible thank you for

up already fucking it up already okay my
guy fell down my guy fell down
I am the ball I thought you could run
past them apparently not oh no the other
guy what
that's not what I wanted to do that's
what you did why did you do that that's
a that's the good question right why did
I do that
the answer is I don't know
yes 100% me guys right
I saw someone sad say it went offsides
guys remember offsides no the answer is
no we don't I wasn't
passing the ball I was dribbling it is
that that's a dribble in soccer yeah
what what happened soccer the offsides
again I'm sure god damn it look about it
like I have
inch inch mine now that was a pretty
powerful shot and I felt good about it
Danny Welbeck box-to-box this player
what stamina it's a wonderful life
yeah Oh what stamina
okay we're going back here now
apparently
I take you back to a game we were
covering at wicked we got an archives to
drive home and we both switch on our
radio and heard the speculation which
don't have to be found that Alex
Ferguson was going to stand down what
are they just idly chit-chatting during
our game yes what does what what guys
they going to do what the fuck we're
playing a game here I suppose they have
to fill on a month amount of boring yes
what's going on there's gotta be
horribly annoying once you've gone
through all of the chit chat right what
what's what happened I don't know I was
able to put the ball on the ground and
kick it for some reason it's great get
out of my way get out of my my lowly I
know my now
feel like I'm not really doing much
beyond like just moving left character
near yours you know yeah and then that's
it that's all I'm doing is moving my
character near your character so you
looking forward to the Super Bowl
tonight can we just talk about something
good like the Super Bowl
something something should be going on
while we're doing this oh that wasn't a
decisive save he stopped the ball from
going in the thing oh shit
I'm not touching anybody
okay okay
great
nope okay you have the ball rich has the
ball I'm trying to think of anything
else interesting we can talk about this
is a little mind-numbing
and I'm sure all of our European fans
are very happy with our treatment of
their national fuck'em they chose the
sport right right right
Oh
no he didn't he didn't sweet sweet it in
this white spot sweet in this wet spot
sweet it in the hit spot has it to me
pass it to me
might happen might happen
my thumb's getting sore yeah yeah Oh is
there any way to keep it from switching
what guy you're controlling you don't
want to I don't know maybe one of the
our book
who did you pass it to oh you best him
okay great great
Oh
you know I think you kicked in it
anything so that means somebody shoots
him right I'll be honest I that means he
gets murdered now that means he gets
murdered after the game yes that was an
embarrassment to your country
they're both in the same country
I'm saying oh yeah yes we're both an
embarrassment to both of our countries
let's be nice we play soccer
you got it no no we got it we got it we
got it we got it to this guy
passes it to that guy yes is it to that
guy passes it to the other team that's
fine
wait I wanted to be the other guy let's
see this makes no sense yeah I want to
be a guy in the front yeah I don't can I
be another guy
great kick great save great save from
there okay oh shit is there a button to
flop in this game I'm sorry what did you
say
kiss me esses me now cuss me out mate oh
shit
oh wait I did it lol one I changed my
guys I changed my dude Oh guys yes thank
you
lime Aziz what happened I don't care
that's the summation of football rich in
eyes opinion
oh we're playing you
tossed him didn't hesitate today with
that challenge
yeah well God
oh that was a very successful slide
tackle wrench
oh that might've been fine they're fine
if it's like on their card
what that's huge
yeah you fucked up this time great I'm
okay with this
okay so the big thing that I'm figuring
out is there is like a very legitimate
power meter even when passing you know
yeah really yeah in one passage even
when passing it's so like it's it's not
when you press the button between a girl
or a boy
okay that's so like if you if you're
making a larger a longer pass like a
little bit a little bit longer we're
picking up on the intricacies of a games
we're never gonna play okay
look I think I attempted to go and fail
this is support
oh we're playing
Oh
yeah apparently you can run faster with
a heart to art that's what this thing
what what what are you doing schmuck
okay
he looks as confused as we do because
remember we can't have this be exciting
Oh
Oh
Oh
see this again this thing
I mean hey that was a good play I did
that all on purpose that was a good play
and I felt good about it listen you know
I'm listen I don't like any sport don't
I'm not I'm not I don't mean to shit
extra hard on fruitball Sakura I don't
care for any professional sport I've
never found like a sports game to be
exciting
this is particularly like I just don't
get it and you know being an American
we're not around the soccer that one you
know like it's just not something that
we're accustomed to I hate it when
switches characters and I end up running
the wrong way yeah this is which
character that was going to and so
you know I do I look JIT omit Li
apologize if you think I'm being cross
with football but uh I just don't
understand what's going on you guys have
a lifetime of like watching this game
and understanding it's like football
I've seen a like an American football
game you know so I have some sort of
context with what I'm supposed to be
doing when playing Madden game whereas
with this I just have no fucking idea
wh0 attack you get it back
too much too much house too much sales
Oh mister sub sorry
sorry I'll let Mitch do what he does
