easy you know you you do what you do I'm
just I'm just explaining how into this
yeah yeah forget elations
this might be a more recent in songs I
don't think we played this that much on
the new computer because we've only got
a few you you you find a number of like
12 or 15 letter long words I mean you're
insane
don't use any kind of cheap anything
usually when I find a good one it's just
pops up at me they just look at the
whole thing and it's like oh yeah now

st. tailgate
and Chad you're you're on your honor -
not cheap yeah I'm going to look at what
you're saying something I'll play but I
need your word as a gentleman that there
will be no cheating
we can't play fart because there's no
ass and like when you get like when you
really get a good word then it guilty
awesome fantastic and like the worm
turns into a wrecking ball and hits the
Oratory

it's true
X experiential
you've killed a rare magical beasts oh
god no expires perennial perennial
parrot meal
pixal there's no team you can't do
pixelated my vent line of thought though
I like that line of thought that's let's
switch so I can see Shepard okay
first Cecil delighted Ella Griffin I
know don't you do that and somebody's
saying penis will take penis just out of
curiosity probably although like we I
wanted to do pederast the one day and it
wouldn't let me
what's the Pinterest do I wanna know I
don't want to know I've decided I don't
want to know penis yes and he says Wow
so yeah you like so Lex likes penis you
could also do know they like to do penis
you're good at penile / Nick's what I
think it's just making sure
Catamount there's no see people are just

buying some time we have a J they're
going T there there is a healing potion
we bet that is a possibility lling can
they see the screen yeah the healing
potion is over here makes your hearts
qualifier there's the the phrasing the
other guy potion and the making your
words more ass-kicking sure if they
couldn't see the screen I'd be amazed
that they're coming up with words just

oh you totally dangerous I like you as
Lex so true come on my hut for another
minigame first I hate fearsome beasts so
now we play the mini game three legged
or mini games in potions and whatnot and
like when you when you when you beat the
whole thing then you can unlock the mini
games to play whenever you want so in
this mini game we have to guess the word
in 5 turns so it starts with an O you
want to go with order I guess it's first
it sure maybe or it's then actually has
two hours I mean it that could work you
want it soldiers strategic illogically
you're good using as many different
letters as you can to roll things out
and then go go with older those are
common letters and there's one each the
other is a perfectly good choice too
Oh none of those letters were in there
none of those letters gold means the
letters the right letter in the right
spot silver means the right letter in
the wrong spot yeah bra means that
letter isn't in there the red letters at
the bottom not in there yeah all right
well you got no it's not other because
there's no er orgasm has too many
letters let's see
happy ogre can't be otter
oh my god can't be Oregon there's no R
who chats got a good one do you want
ovince active octa ve too many tomatoes
so many letters good thought but too
many letters can't be open there's no II
know II because we've rolled out the
optic optic might work
turned up okay so we know there's cg but
it's not in that spot so it can't be
like ocean no it couldn't be any way
they've done chat just got oaths the
team would be in the wrong spot eighty
yeah it can't be oats
cuz that T can't be in that third spot
because it's silver if it were gold that
would mean it's in the right spot here
and it can't be over E because we know
that there's a T but it's not in that
spot it can't be wait Oh T it can't be
other because there's no e
it can't be old because there's no T in
the third spot can't be Evans because

words this is a fun game over seems a
nice word jinx is a very nice word but
there no enumerate enumerates has more
letters jinx is is certainly lovely for
what he uses and I think we can still
use it out of pretty much if we get
another s when we use it on the next 100
wasn't quite enough it wasn't quite
enough offertory knowing you to of
our why aii the damage you just said
they said holy fuck ha oxygen-oxygen a
yeah oxygenate there's a good word
maybe maybe next we'll get womb Smith's
rooms rooms pay is the thing it's a
whole thing you don't watch your shows
you don't get it
check we rich um you want to read the
eyes right oh yeah check check out the
Lord for this monster mix this monster
has a bonus word category of metal words
and they mean like you know 10 yeah not
like although that would be metallic
yeah when you spell words that are of
the metal category this monster will
suffer extra damage so iron tin bronze
when all work yes any metal word what
about Malik diem or unum ilium those two
yes yes those two Mex
oh we need an elf or fundable you smell
booze wah be for Bob Boone a game
there's an S yeah yeah alright to tribes

like scribble notes and I think that she
would like Skrill wants whoever trying
to type faster - I smell scribble ass
mister shy smile was recognizing
Scribblenauts I will have to that's a
game it's a game I looked into the end
of that for sure
buffering let's give that a try good so
good yeah yeah I'm giving the chat time
to come up with something right now I
need time you're already in there you're
in there you're in there work in the
body faded
debatin
there's no water down there
I'm up charted yeah jointed disjointed
desert as if there was as we do
disjointed
done time
this is John kilo 3 d en ta ta so I
think so
Titian
cards flute has antidote
this iconic says notation which was
better off than my head
by the time okay
oh these are some funky ass letters here
for Jana Sena
to J's and a p-type Nazis they go like
see Kyle or something oh really really
oh I know they were horrible people it's
all thumb me I don't don't do that don't
do that
or I might have that word kilo up on our
screen no need that no resumed SS two
tribes can anybody be trees owned
you have 30 seconds starting now - what
doesn't
three one thousand
somebody says ejaculation there's no L
no no i'll Kel's owned calzone yeah
calzone is it's there's no L but calzone
is food yep
ejaculate there's no L know doesn't that
was the reason that long okay yeah you
can't do it anything involving a jacket
right Azerbaijan it's a proper name I'm
calling it we're done let's go we're
going resumed it is a little tip a
little tap we'll keep that bronze does
extra damage yeah you don't want though
the extra damage from the metal works is
usually disappointing it's disappointing
compared to the monster words that Karen
can come up with yeah I mean bronze you
would it is just definitely a metal work
but it's not as much extra as you might
think unfortunately
check our because we're avoiding it
because with experience from this game
we know that the bigger monster word is
usually usually worth more points jojoba
if you're like I feel like if you're
like a kid who's coming up with like
words like 10th then when you come up
with a metal word that's really amazing
but when you're come on up with some
wack shit yo this is Wireless Center
maybe doesn't like a mousepad leftover
became also came up with a joke oh I
should read that there I read that oh
thank you man you loved over beefcake
