[Rich's car is rammed off the road by an opponent]

Jack: Oh, my god. Wait until he gets out of his car and steal his car.

Rich: They don't always get out of the car, Jack. 

[Rich pauses the game, and enters the control menu]

Rich: Oh, god. You got me inversed. This was wrong. That's what's horribly wrong right now.

Jack: That's exactly what's wrong. 

Rich: Where, where am I at, where am I at? Here we go.

Jack: Oh, wait, wait. Uh, go back. Did you see it? You have to click on it, then click to "No", and then click on it again. There ya go. Okay, that's it.

[Rich unpauses the game, and immediately one of his opponents runs him over.]

Jack: You did it. Oh, that was great.

Rich: I think that's the end point, and a half.

Jack: Oh, that was terrible. That was terribly funny.

Rich: That was great.
