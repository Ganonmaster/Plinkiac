actually control a reasonable degree
like what's happened just used to you
know when you're used to a controller
this I you know I'd like the sensitivity
to get a little better but what you used
to control it you need a controller okay
boom okay
but you know if you replace all the
cutesy items with I don't even know you
would replace it with you know like it's
making its room now

this is just a thing that has to happen
I feel okay okay I also like sales
they're very real pain anytime that my
character screams like that it's like a
visceral screams from right in my ears

[D] I don't I don't know I don't know where
I'm supposed to go there one thing at a
time one problem that's what we're in
the other one fucking is it spice
there's a cherry bomb cherry bombs can't
touch the ground that's what's happening
before they touch the ground
spicy spikes am I gonna you shot my
dying this is important okay okay okay
okay okay
oh I'm shooting my friend thank you
that's what's happening
well the Tonya that time I shall strike
for sure these sorry friends okay that's
what it was I was shooting too much of
this rent guy over here and accidentally
shooting my friend okay here we go I
beat you you know what this is
horrifying and I kind of love it
we're gonna do one more level one more
level and then we have to end this
because this is just too fucking weird
okay we just need to take a breather
we just need to take a breather we just
need to take a breather I'm gonna I'm
gonna hide behind this rock
it has ever thought about how much it
would cost to go to e3 if you have
thought about doing any interesting
conventions in you are there any we have
the Midwest gaming classic which is kind
of a it's a tabletop gaming convention
and uh like pinball thing that we keep
on to go to they also have like non
classic games but really no we don't
have like good conventions near
Milwaukee people told you this before
but you play some weird fucking games I
did you know what they have told me that
before and it's true they have told me
before and it's true this is a weird
weird game but this game that was
playing I don't need I don't even know
what I don't even know why outside of
the truth I got it on the stream sale
and and so just see what will just free
what the game is like doesn't matter I
was trying to one shot one kill
sniper feel like that sometimes the best
option is just to run blindly and you
can see what happens I didn't say oh I
didn't set off that one I didn't set off
that cherry bomb how did I not set up a
cherry bomb
boom Jesus Christ one or more horrible
what so we have some conventions around
here we're not necessarily interested in
going to e3 just because we find it to
be horrible just to just to watch III
let alone go you know maybe something
like like pax maybe something like pax
just cuz you see more games I think but
this is for reals II the end of the
stream we need to stop look at that bird
oh my god my friends are just staring at
me look at my friends he's staring at me
we need to stop lane stop it
