was great no god but ben affleck there
that was so awful it was way worse than
you could ever imagine I mean I saw and
they I never thought it was bad until I
rewatched it you know as an adult
apparently rich is dying again
I'm always dying that's true I guess we
all spend your whole life slowly dying
that's true yeah yeah he's slowly dying
alright back to the top i J
whoa oh my god oh my god throw us down
thrust down yeah that's fine I just
don't want I like going fast jack I know
I got a need for speed
Jack now we are definitely in a body yep
this plot going on here definitely you
know these are like eggs okay that is an
electricity monster so it turned out a
stabilizer oh my god well use this
electricity scanner the stabilizer I now
we should be good
that is an electricity monster oh my god
probably don't want to touch it I mean
oh fuck that came out of nowhere
oh no we're not that no we're not dead
rich just wanted to go fast again that
sounds like a really Hornet real arm
Oh hold on scanner yeah okay that is a
heat monster so turning our not yet it's
just floating them all right you should
be ready to go knock into it to feeling
dick
do you want to hear hey hey remember
when you shot me with that thing
how's that feel shooter Jennifer hey I
won't get you miss check oh my god I
feel nice a dick a dick in a space when
traveling through the colon we're
traveling through Dennis Quaid why is it
so drunk in here no Dennis Quaid you got
it all wrong Randy Quaid Martin Short
this blade was other thing Dennis Quaid
was the guy he was riding through in
Innerspace no I have it backwards this
Dennis Quaid was riding in Martin Short
what the hell is wrong with you
I knew Dennis Quaid was in it Jabbar do
you ever one luck Skywalker told Darth
Vader that he was his father I do
remember that that was a weird scene
wait hold on
I don't engine shortcuts press R or L to
quickly turn your engine's on or off oh
I know what we got to do what kind of
monsters are these doesn't you gotta
turn your engine off no sir
scan these monsters I did huh okay ready
yeah you had to know something like that
was coming why were you waiting for the
quick turn on after the introduction of
the quick startup quick turn off why
Jack okay I'm ready
oh you know what the real problem is I
didn't have the decelerator on okay
and the decelerator stops you
automatically so you don't have to touch
anything
all right ready yeah maybe you should
touch something sorry we've done so many
times so many times
okay okay okay ready yeah I'm ready
are you ready I might not be ready I
don't think you are here we go
I'm oh my god oh my god
my piloting skills saved us your your
mad skills like crack shot piloting
skills I can't go there
skin you hit the Scan button
I was hitting the flare that is an
electricity monster and a heat monster
oh okay I know this one yep I know this
one uh so don't do anything right now
I'm taking up our electricity
you just get ready to hit the engine the
second we could pass whatever this is no
I don't know what's taking up our
electricity scandal scanners off do I
need to turn the fuel engine on it's
also a heat monster I thought I could
just use the antigravity we're slowly
going up are we yeah yeah we're okay
yeah how's that perfect okay I'm gonna
turn the fuel engine
this is not helping
none of this is helping
because if I turn the electric engine on
can we float - can we drift past like
last time
no I uses too much electricity okay just
floating up I'm trying to figure it out
like
oh you know we might have to do one so
I'm gonna turn the electric engine on
its thrust all the way up okay
are you know turn the anti graph to
neutral thrust all the way up and then
I'm just gonna like click it off to try
to we're try to jump past it all right
so I'm gonna go go here we go on now
nope there again all right I'll go all
right ready go
yep cut nope gotta go faster yep well
I'm turning the decelerator all the way
off I guess it doesn't really matter
forget I thrust is all the way up all
right I'm ready and you know that you
have to cook cut button ready right
quick cut button right gang Oh barely on
who I never got salt ready yep and fault
okay ready for full throttle or is it
down here here oh great now easy alright
nevermind nevermind nevermind nevermind
nevermind yep that was really graceful I
know my name is Tate I'm sorry yes it
doesn't matter if we got the job done
with grace and style and that we just
got it done which is more important huh
man well considering we're broadcasting
this I think grace and style I'm just
hoping we can bubble our way through to
tell you the truth you here's a question
good do you care if your sports team of
choice clumsily wins the championship
does that matter or the Broncos won the
Superbowl but you know they fumbled the
ball a few times they won actually
through fumbling it was really strange
they fumbled it another one of the team
members picked it up then someone else
fumbled it got real lucky that's all I'm
saying
oh I see what we're gonna have to do
scan the thing first though we're gonna
hitch a ride Oh hold on the small craft
is equipped with three types of landing
gear stuffs soft sticky are sliding okay
we're gonna watch sticky yeah
who controls the landing gear you
possibly verily I have no button someone
indicate otherwise so I guess we gotta
land on that thing cut cut all powers I
don't know babe long we don't want to
cut the car to the landing gear
obviously well this is a this is a sound
monster right here yeah so this is like
doing stuff like that it would really
piss it off but you're under the sound
threshold so really we just need to land
and glide by without moving all right
okay I'm gonna land that thing huh I'm
gonna land on that thing okay ready
sticky on okay Jack I don't think you're
right about anything I had too many
things on we have too many things on we
have too many things out okay okay hold
on let me turn some things down
when do we I'm sorry do you have a
police light is with the scanners blue
yeah LeClair is rig rapidly switch
between them nothing that does not like
what you're doing
alright stickies on your joik
oh my god the sound does have a
cool-down I turn the engines off I think
that's what I need to do is to kill the
engines and put it in neutral stock car
time now running with the cruise control
cruise control yeah I already yep we're
good to go
and I'm gonna turn it on as soon as we
get out on that sticky off
well
down down down goes
nope
did that kill us maybe need that on the
block I would assume so
and I'm gonna say yes oh it's over here
let's figure out the rest of this place
can that thing that's a sound monster
again
I don't know if we do need that on the
block
I mean you were sooo hey cuz I'm
assuming what time would you skip a
juice no juice you got electric juice
what else around I'm just fuckin thing
right
oh maybe do we need to get that thing
over here to block that thing possibly
that's what I would assume well we have
to get him up I don't know how we'd get
that off gotta get it up
nope
all right we have fully explored okay so
yeah I think we need to take that thing
and then move it up to block the laser
I'm gonna give you more thrust I don't
know how the hell we're supposed to get
this off oh we could probably land on it
and carry it oh my god no no no oh wait
can we carry backup maybe on sticky off
just a on sticky on oh my god we totally
can but we need to go through that laser
thing well we can need to put it on the
conveyor right okay great great and I'm
just gonna do the same thing where I
kill the hold on hold on oh my god oh my
god okay I'm sick I'm sick I'm sick
no no it's fine we go through yeah I
turn the power off Barham oh yeah do
some more juice yeah give me all the
juice I can't have all the juice cuz
you're about to run out of juice fine I
can't have all the juice because I'll
kill the crate and her friend alcoholics
okay put it back put back there just
hang there for a second
well the reactor stress goes on
just want to put it on top and I'll kill
the stickies
who's the leader huh Nicole Nicole
Simpson Nicole Brown Simpson and Kato
that was the houseguest was the other
victim what who's the other victim you
said give me so much juice in the OJ too
much juice I don't I'll kill Nicole
Simpson and I can't oh I get it
Wow you know what I'm gonna go ahead and
call that a reach yeah
reaching back ritmo most guys most guys
appreciate it a reach-around jack guys
appreciate that I I'm sorry what I'm
sorry
are you talking about stroking a mutt
another means dick while you're having
sex but what is that what you're talking
no talking about while you anally
penetrated a man reaching around and
stroking his shaft reach your arm I'm
just come someone hug when they've had
like a bad day
oh wait years you're a sick perverted
man Jack makes more sense a sick
perverted man I mean I guess that
because I guess that makes I guess that
makes more sense
then what I was unless you're gay which
point that's that's perfectly natural
it's perfectly normal
it really is I'm gonna go to the
bathroom okay you talk to people kill
time I'm gonna confirm by lying down
here and having my back kind of sort of
bothered me a bit that's how I'll kill
time Jack hi what's going on I can't
even see the chance so it's not like we
can we can interact they monitor with
the chance all the way at the other side
of the room and I I can't get up to look
at it because I'm I'm an invalid I'm
essentially an invalid
yeah how's everyone doing
you enjoying this stream I mean you
gonna answer me I can't see it feel free
to answer me anyway you enjoy the stream
oh right that's great
what what
so we've been playing the shit out of
this game yeah that's the thing that
happened I call me dinner Evans I can't
even play the game to pass time awkward
Oh a real a sweet release of death where
is it
where is the sweet release of death hmm
let's just let's just sit here and be
quiet for a moment
7-7 moment of silence for Nicole Simpson
and that other guy
dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt house
arrest that guy I don't know I don't
know what the fuck I'm doing
just don't some stretch of smile mild
stretches here because I should I really
should
yes yeah we could take a break myself
great I'm sorry to leave you alone with
the rich then what are you doing oh my
god rich is getting up
Jax just went for reach Jax just went
for a reach and had a bathroom time I
needed a bathroom break you know what I
had a big ass coffee before we started
screaming and some water so what is what
true what we say most things are true
what we say I guess Allah now I'm by
myself
oh rich it was Ron Goldman captain if
Vic says there are legitimate excuses
for going to see pixels losing a bet
perhaps having a loved one held for
ransom may be a serious blow to the head
yeah that's about it I mean the I think
the only there there are two legitimate
reasons to go see pixels one is if you
are watching it for some sort of movie
review type program and two is if you
have a mental deficiency and so if you
if you say to yourself man that Adam
Sandler sure it makes funny movies and
Kevin James is also good and I want to
see a movie about retro arcade games
coming to life then you might have a
mental deficiency or it's for work right
I think that I think this movie
diminishes Pacman's love ability because
of his involvement in the movie and so
even if you just really like pac-man or
Donkey Kong there's no reason to see
this movie
if you if you're a fan of peckmon you
have very few other options even if
you're a fan of pac-man
what will seeing a crappy movie with
that pac-man happens to be in do for you
I mean if you're a fan of Donkey Kong
yeah then you can just watch King Kong
in like a tiny screen sure that's pretty
much the same thing where you could
watch king of Kong which is a great
movie yeah yeah you got me there yeah
rich did you see um do you see the new
XCOM 2 trailer I know okay all right I
don't know there was a new trailer
there's a new trailer Oh check it out
when I get home okay all right we're
back we have a couple new subscribers
I'll thank you right now because when
I'm Zeno trope and dysphoria blues thank
you for sub scribe Eng we really it's
true a really do rish
it that was awful
right that was fucking awful I think you
know where I'm trying something new
that's gonna be the new thing we really
appreciate it
what about stru we really do I don't
understand why Peter Dinklage is in the
movie cuz he's a midget no he but he
doesn't take those roles well he does
know he's famous no no because like he's
famous for not taking the stereotypical
midget roles he just sold out he did
sell out but I don't think his role is
like a midget I think he's playing the
Billy West he's in the movie because
he's a midget no he's in the movie
because he's a hot actor right now he's
also in the movie because he's a midget
no I had him Sandler is in charge and
Adam Sandler in his head he put him in
the movie because he's a mid you know I
don't believe that I believe that I
think anyone with the name recognition
recognizability what's who's that who's
the antagonist of king of Kong Billy
West
no silly wes is the voice actor right
fry and the M&M; and others he because he
has read and Stimpy you know he has the
mullet Peter Dinklage has the mullet and
pixels so I think he's supposed to be
the what's his fucking name King Billy
King now and after the king that's a
tennis player that's Billie Jean King
that's Billie Jean King it's not Billy
Corgan really Mitchell thank you thank
you mall Radko Billy Mitchell and other
guide Billy Mitchell I'm the good guy
and so he's the Billy Mitchell character
and and it's just because he's a hot
named actor at the moment okay oh I got
too much thrust thrust down oh okay that
is that's our same old Electress oh you
know what we had
we have sliding gear slide a year on I
cut engines or through and I'm through
great
oh you know what sliding a gear off my
sliding your right now I never with her
ah rich your your maverick
I know if only tied eight times put a
piloting error
all right that is again an electricity
and heat monster we have landing gear we
have soft sticky what a soft doin slide
does that make us bounce yeah
I don't know it's soft does all right
well how do we get through this thing
what is this what is this allergic to
heat and electricity so basically this
is an engines off kind of monster okay
here's what we do we glide in okay and
then once we hit the button then we
slide out okay okay so we need glide
ease slide ease hey ready that was an
engineer
okay I'm going yep cut it whatever you
want all right shoot that thing stick
sick oh okay I see oh okay I see you
then you can show okay I'm with it sorry
engines on all right that stick there's
a shoot shoot all right
nice slide ease off nice rich we pwned
that area what no we don't we don't say
that what happen pika because it's a
ridiculous word life is ridiculous you
know also true
shut it I mean let me just
reconnaissance what's up here we're kind
of oh oh so many things I was born we
got button there everything wants to
move but it's a button we can just head
that's the door we need to open oh these
are sliding puzzles oh my god these are
definitely slightly puzzles oh my god
there's the thing there I'm sure these
are all heat and electricity monsters
yep
skin yep
go sticky go sticky
ha
uh-oh I'm sticky and move him with this
way now you know this isn't gonna work
sticky go okay yeah we need to get I
think there's something we can do with
this though oh we got a gun I think it's
just to get on the other side and then
you know pop out easy oh yeah that makes
perfect sense
yeah that's what we starting down sure
here first all right
was that that was the other problem down
here right yeah we already did okay I'm
gonna get a slider you ready
we got time it ready now we need a
little more thruster and now oh oh yeah
then I'll get us a button okay that's
right we get stuck good no I can't I can
only imagine that there's no getting
stuck yeah
all right we got one Oh slow your
thruster roll crazy pilot gotta fall
under I'm hurting off him it's can't
leave it off Oh God Oh No okay
hold on I think we're fine yeah
know what scanner off I think if I just
turn an anti grab on all right
nope oh I get it that what the wheel we
need to go to sticky ah
oh okay
we have sliders stick yeah
good enough good enough for me oh I
sense some slight ease coming up start
it now nope momentum momentum stick
Lourdes yes this is a cop game I Jack is
controlling the jack is controlling like
the power supplies and riches steering
and guiding me because I need to look at
the power supplies Wow whoa wait it's
kinda thing you need to get up there oh
oh or do we need to shoot oh fuck
you slide ready
I got a flare ready okay oh well you hit
it I wonder if that counted unknown
let's find out
yep okay so one more I think there's
yeah there's one more Oh what's up here
heat me up here is up here up here is up
here how are you why are you so curious
whoa useful here oh god how do we how do
we do that
how do we do that push we can we stick
to the bottom we slide on the bottom I
don't think we can slide now can you
tilt us around
that's not know there's there's gravity
we can't slide no I can't turn this
other way around this might just be a oh
can we stick to that can we stick to the
underside yeah but that won't help us
yes it will how will that help us get to
the top and then let go and then fold
the bottom platform oh oh no we can't
cuz I can't turn all the way around okay
you just move fast enough yeah okay
great
right now there's gonna probably one
another one up here yeah yeah oh yeah
this one super awesome fun time we gotta
we gotta do some mad jump yeah oh oh god
oh god no oh God
sliders on get us through okay I'm ready
to slide ready oh nice good good that's
very satisfying it's like a shuttlecraft
you know why it's like a shuttlecraft
yeah cuz it keeps crashing oh I get it
that's a Star Trek joke I get that's a
very that's a fine because every time
somebody uses a shuttlecraft you know
it's gonna crack down yeah I'm a planet
like you know I get it I get it
and it's funny because the script
required somebody did not get stranded
they would just use the transporter the
ship would fly their picture
we-we-we sorry you know how fast you
were going
sprays police we're her space yeah which
I are pretty cool just say rich yeah can
I talk to you about a hamburger a
hamburger can I talk to you about a
hamburger yes you can
I feel awful today and I you know what I
had for dinner what I had a go-gurt okay
a child's go-gurt that sounds awful yeah
yeah what'swhat's this is what steal
hair yeah I'm fighting to drop in and
then somehow get to that oh sure wait
well we get in that whole talk you know
we need to shoot so we stick to it
I get stickies and then turn off the
engine and once we stick so if I go
around you know oh wait oh I see yeah
and shoot the laser he they go in damage
egg what we need to get in that hole
yeah but what kind of monster is that oh
no that's an everything monster by the
way that is a sound heat electricity
monster but we can still use the landing
gears right
I would fly over and then you cut
everything and then we stick to the
bottom okay that's the plan okay
oh I can't get over we can only get in
from no we didn't go over well we can
get in from the other side
oh wait can we well this is matter what
sign out dinner okay stickies ready yeah
I'm going in turn stickies off let's
fall fall we need to be on the bottom of
this this thing sticky sticky
all right you aim for the thing oh this
is like Oh like I'm stick stick stick
this is not gonna work what are you
doing we hit it we hit it no no I was
gonna we were gonna have to think wait
why'd we get there we can angle we can
angle let go let go let go damn it jack
rich were on the edge no this is gonna
be great all right this is gonna work
we're on the edge ready or not
Jack where's my thing oh there it is
okay
well you don't do what I tell you to do
so I'm not gonna tell you I'll tell you
I thought I thought being on the edge
here would be make shooting easier don't
think it should aim down disengage where
do we need to go on the other side of
this thing yeah yeah yeah just just
disengage disengage just give me power
did you know okay ah okay Oh God
Richards captain and me as engineer is
heartbreaking
oh that's all this herding cats herding
cats oh my god yeah I think that's a
pushy thing down there over there
oh I think we need to go down where the
button was what the button is yeah
there's a hole think he's ready
because it doesn't really matter no it
doesn't shadow haha engineer um I'm
taking applications for a new engineer
would you would you know that would be
in nightmare
I am not used to it sure do you all do
you really wants to huh which way that's
which I can be an engineer it's fine
that was more just Hey
okay oh oh that's fun if you like
stopping progress
just slutty Samoa guys just slide right
in I turn it off I turn it off
immediately okay I just wanna let you
know that okay this time just ladies
through slide ease just ladies now it's
nineties I think grabbity might take us
in sure no bouncies don't know that
stickies bouncies oh it's not really
bouncy that's just soft landing let's
put us on normal that's not our area
and I just need to cut sooner cut
slide
are we gonna hit the button again to
their rabbit grab Alfred
I don't think this is gonna work sorry I
wasn't ready to hit the button again
miss oh my god what are you doing huh
getting them just moving us is my work
don't don't don't let go for no reason
well that was close
that was close okay all right we can do
this
boom alright slide
sliding we're getting all sliders up in
this
all right all wrong
all right nice hey you think up or down
I see what's up
is that blocky thing oh maybe we need to
take it with us
sure oh my god we what do I need to do
with it before I stop carrying it around
with us everywhere left lost yeah rich
you are a reckless pilot I am I totally
am Top Gun Jack haha my gun nothing I
think I know what we need to do with
this now
sticky sticky more thrust power lot more
something warm we're in any kind of
danger zone we're getting in there the
more you move it the more danger where
maybe we need to hold on I think I'm
gonna move to fuel engine okay
okay give that a try
mark more alone more getting there okay
you got more okay
no no no no it was gonna kill us well we
hit it a weird angle
well your fault wasn't anyone it was
just fuck yes but it was oh hey look
yeah oh yeah that works that's what I
was trying to do oh and he came down it
came down sideways rich this ship needs
more communication you needed to you
needed to communicate your plans well
that was that wasn't anything you can do
it was just piloting well I'm just
saying if you would have communicated
the plan I wouldn't have cut power I
would have trusted in your piloting a
bit oh oh you cut power I did kept our
why did you do that
why would I ask why would I have to
deconstruct you not to do something well
cuz I cuz I from my point of view is
like oh we're gonna die I should cut
power in case we're gonna seize us we're
gonna spin this thing yeah and get in
that hole and then we're gonna spit it
back I'm already on it I got my stick Oh
so I didn't be to explain bad it was
obvious based on what was going on in
the screen
dude's more primer like oh it's gotta go
back out on its own gave me a ton of
power once we let go yeah we're ready
let me know when you let go let go okay
okay I was afraid it would move on its
own it didn't we're gonna stare cut cut
cut too much oh reactor overload yeah
yeah we're gonna we're gonna cool down
for a bit
yep there you go
there you go all right how we stuck to
it huh how we stuck
we are stuck to it we are moving okay
more power
Hey
so and took me down what but first I I
think but first it's all fine but first
dad that that I can't get J to play the
third guy he's not here anymore
this game is potentially a friendship
destroyer you're right no this is
classic multiplayer this is but this is
like we both win this is a friendship
tester is what it is and we're feeling

ooh a red one red is usually bad
well I read usually means something else
leaves here
we got something we got options we got
some options ready what do you want Jack
ah you know blues right there so maybe
blue camera I can't see them you can't
know
okay okay these are all electricity and
slightly sound monsters mostly
electricity so I think actually I can
just do that oh oh oh yes
I'm turning your thruster way down okay
now give you some thrust good I can tell
ya we're still in aa we're still in out
of tricity monster I think I need to
turn off your stabilizer thrust way down
stabilizer off you are good to go yeah
so I go somewhere not smelling it so
that's why there's a pinky over there so
I guess we can go back to the pinky all
right Pinkett us out swabbing yourself
oh that's a that's a reference to Star
Wars Episode one The Phantom Menace yes
I can't go up why can't I go up anymore
there we go you're gonna do it old
Bessie
- I don't wanna go into blue Stano keep
it like a must keep it like a let's keep
it shitty we ended up back here okay all
right don't mind the disco dance party
okay so I guess that purple and don't
fall into the blue one again alright get
move don't go far enough
ah yeah power and stabilization no don't
go in the red red thanks is back there
now there one cuz that just takes us
back to where we were this thing we
learned see we learn to think yeah but
we yes we did but we don't want to go
there yet I know that oh my god straight
down
okay we're now in jalopy mode old jalopy
enables something else we need to hit I
don't know what it is but I think we
need to go back over dere
go back to red and that oh yeah that
opened that up now all right normal
engines please and stabilize okay all
right okay you know what hold on this is
moving you like trick engines are a lot
smoother zero normal normal yeah or at
least the rest for opinion yeah use
here's nice smooth electric power no
electric J we are now running Prius up
in here no we're not Prius because we go
pretty fast
we're running Tesla up in here shit huh
and jalopy Oh
- jalopy oh I hate jalopy
Oh God fool jalopy you know what I have
not tried 5-hour energy lately last time
I did 5-hour energy I was at a bachelor
party and we were drinking it all night
to make it to the strip clubs and
whatnot and and it messed up my brain up
too much it works very well so I know I
don't do 5-hour energy anymore
I'm gonna run out of juice hold on your
controller balls from D machine
it was at a full charge by the way when
we started screaming that's how long the
the gamepad oh really
about two hours yep two hours of solid
play hold on
plugging in plugging in comes of in
terms of a nice long power cable should
plugged in oh my god and kill all my
power
apparently yeah bow-bow okay that is an
electricity and heat monster something
that's like slide well this worse
oh yeah oh we got a slide and shoot I
think there's a button above it
Wow is it big slide all right nice one
sliders on ready to aim yeah yeah me
wait wait give me uh some momentum some
more thrust
yeah thrust up all right we thought I
like that yep it's okay try again I
think we need to go a little faster
thrust up
all right
all right and we're going okay yeah you
you think that's weird
oh that was weird that was a weird noise
clinking it was a public we had already
done yeah it away
I wonder if they running out of things
or if that was like the prelude to like
big but I wonder what the boss fight in
this game is I don't know that's what I
really wonder
Jaken well you can get high-capacity
batteries for the Wii U gamepad oh
that's good
that's nice when you have to buy
something extra you know you know for
moderate functionality I mean you
oh I know you know yeah yes you did you
totally oh we still had our sliders on -
back on
don't just fire flares at it
okay scanning that is an electricity
monster so we should be able to actually
just cool down our thrust and our
decelerator Tron and our scanner now you
should be able to get by it no oh no
just just be cool old slide past it or
we'll just slide past it yeah
sliders on
what a SAP suck no no oh wait all right
there we're getting ready for something
yes this is easy this is like it just a
reminder of all this yeah
that is it everything monster literally
everything so now if we have any sense
you have to break it almost no wait if
we have any sound or electricity like I
need to turn the scanner off there's the
button off there where top top alright
you can watch it right now there's a
button up there there's a button up
there oh okay I think so if we slide
past it and try to stop right under and
now it's a weird angle where's our way
around if we turn out huh oh you tell me
what to do
oh oh I see it what here's the thing
that we did we have no we can't have
anything we can't have anything on how
do we do this
it's our way around
oh yeah
all right ready yeah No
right
huh
I said it's lightning
oh well I'm gonna try and see what
happens the worst that can happen is if
we get struck by lightning I can't even
tell from moving alright alright
where you get through yep
it's like
alright sup shoot okay ready shoots
shoot
no that's open already kill Stan so what
my guess is sticky right before the
laser oh that's how we do okay so but we
need enough momentum to get past it
so I think we need to like shoot up here
okay zoom past it
turn off engines and sticky let me just
sticky
that's slide okay Fred sticky huh right
too sticky
see he's easy okay
the stinky two slide is easy the thing
that's gonna suck is like like oh I can
just keep that there I can keep it like
in a neutral place and so you'll just
have to time your shot okay well it's
always the quick engine cut - yeah
there's always a quick engine cut
already oh it comes right back up I
didn't know comes right back that's all
right that's all right that we had time
doing extra momentum oh we're back here
yeah oh but actually no we can't do that
because the scanner needs to be off we
can have no
let's just try going in there and
turning the scanner on okay
sliders are on okay let's try that again
no I don't think again is going to work
it just ate us Jack hmm you want to
train again all right I just want to see
if the landing gear takes any power no
it does not yeah what's right of you all
right
give me I'm gonna I'm gonna go huh I'm
just gonna go on the count of three one
two three
/ I'm somebody huh its proximity I think
it hears us I think it makes a sound I
think we're making a sound in we slide
no I I may be yet because that that
thing is 100 percent sound heat and
electricity all right
maybe even if I cut her into sliding
make noise huh
the sliding make noise I don't know
Justin I don't sliders iron
now that make noise enough oh wait we
have soft we have soft landing gear
wait you have soft um no no we have soft
landing gear so we just need the land in
the right spot and the soft huh so we
just need the land in the right spot
if it is indeed the sound that's setting
it off I'm not convinced I have no idea
I don't think that's it jack okay what
do you got
what do you want what do you need this
button over the door was that what that
but yeah you'd have been like the door
that was right here
bullets for tracer steps okay
sliders on
came out that
I think it looks like a boob so we got
that going for us and then we got murky
we got Marquis boob underneath oh maybe
there was a secret no all right all
right
ready to sled ready all right cut it out
back on I'm gonna shoot shoot shoot in
the face oh oh you got him move a little
bit
okay I gotta chew the button the button
the button well not yet let's go closer
oh wait can we're gonna wear it out
laser her oh my god rich
she's puppy
headshot I'm gonna imagine the laser
won't kill him we probably just need to
get them past us and then go around yeah
funny tricky thing will be getting past
that yeah
oh it's okay you scan him we can see
like how far we got oh fuck
scan him again
shoot him hey yeah it's out of here fuck
I didn't know he give lunch he lunges
alright we know we're doing what all
we're doing I know and we're a career no
grab blown out panic good fight around
do you wish she'd move a little faster
can you just keep shooting him
oh I don't know true I don't like your
don't like it okay
as long as we can make it through
I don't think this is what the
corporation had a time when it said like
don't get us through oh my god I can hit
him myself ladies
slide these are active I think wait till
he touches the line
okay now do it alright no damn it
okay so it's asked me before he gets to
that second line around
our range we gotta go
we have a decent rant oh I'm not as
worried cause I smell good
this caddy yeah this is an interesting
uh that was a nice little brain puzzle
but it's a little boss
you're right this game doesn't need more
hotdogs it's just in general
I think but I think every game needs
more hot dogs there's not enough hot
dogs and games
I am ready tell me one now
are you saving back quick go get him all
right slide no bullshit
what was that Jack what was he doing it
was heading where this didn't sound like
he was heading back no oh it sound like
I take your word on it all right
it sounded it sounded like he was it's
all right it's all right rich it sounded
like you in fact it's fine
is it it's not fine just be time we've
done this keep that still get our
sliders on ready to power that engine
you just keep shooting I'll tell my
hamburger story an amazing start today I
ate a hamburger for lunch that might
have wrecked my very soul there's a
hamburger a new hamburger place in in
the Greater Milwaukee area that my
brother took me to and my brother likes
eating gross and giant ridiculous food
so we went to this hamburger place and
they make funny special hamburgers not
funny like you know interesting weird
hamburgers and so I decided to eat the
most interesting thing I could find on
the menu that hamburger was the peanut
butter jalapeno bacon hamburgers that's
fucking disgusting
yeah I ready with the slide I'm ready
now
and yes by the way it was fucking
disgusting no I actually was great not
great it was interesting it was it was
it was unique not necessarily a burger I
would want to eat all of the time but
you know it was an interesting flavor
palette and you know I probably would
not eat it again but it was giant and
you know you have it with french fries
and they also had a giant golf
ball-sized cheese curds and if you don't
know what a cheese curd is this might be
a Wisconsin thing a cheese curd is
literally just a hunk of cheese that is
deep-fried that's it that's all it is a
hunk of cheese that is deep-fried and
and I just ate way too much for lunch it
was creamy peanut butter for those
asking creamy peanut butter
what was your blood-alcohol level 0 I we
were working we had a shoot this morning
and we stopped for lunch after the shoot
and I should know better than going out
to lunch with my brother because he
likes to eat weird things
I'm parking to get him up all right that
seems to be it
ready I'm ready to go you're going in
hot
and slide slide stop sup sup oh god oh
god shoot thing we don't know if we'll
come back alright okay oh my god poor
lazy
tilt tilt tilt
I'm using tilt controls great great whoa
boy oh wait first surprise oh oh one of
these things is it huh is this it this
is like the next pot yeah oh so that's
like level two we just yeah a whole
thing was level two that's great
whoo yeah no it was entirely my fault
I blame Oh what that wasn't warning what
oh it was it just failed in yeah it's
entirely my fault that I ate it I agree
that's just the thing
this looks like
I think that's just a thing in general I
think that's a background I know
oh but you know my fault for eating it I
overeat sometimes and it makes me feel
awful and so for for dinner all I had
was a go-gurt
1993 nice just like laughing while doing
her why she must be a good one of the
game devs not a voice actors yeah oh
great great oh well you know it's ten
o'clock I think we might call it yeah I
think Zoo
alright alright I think that was a lot
of fun yeah I know it was great that's a
big victory let's just see what's next
I'm just gonna click figured out just a
little okay get out of here what what
Jack turn thrusts all the way up to know
what thrust is I'm just gonna speed
ahead
hold the phone the email about the
stream went out 20 minutes ago is that
true Tiberius Kirk well I'm very sorry
yeah we've been at it since seven yeah
well seven thirteen thirteen seven
thirteen so that's that's close to the
three hour stream cue you texted me
something rich oh I'm just checking the
time did you but text about texted you
rich but texted me the letter Q so I
think he was trying to send me a secret
code for couette or maybe he was calling
me a cutie but forgot the T so thank you
rich I'll take that do I have to give
you a reach-around
no I Arkham stream before they hear that
oh that's right Colonel rich mustard
someone someone tweeted me a good idea
that is gonna be a bit of an undertaking
but it will happen
Colonel rich mustard I got I got a tweet
today we got a tweet today I say we got
a tweet cuz previously recorded against
me but I checked that Twitter yeah and I
came up with a really good idea which is
they needed to know what games we
already own on Steam and GOG okay
because they didn't want to give this
duplicate copies yeah and so what I want
to create is another awesome spreadsheet
okay of games that we own on Steam G and
Gog and other formats to eventually
write so that for people who don't feel
like gifting us something can can feel
you know good and knowing that they're
giving us a new game something we don't
already have so yes we will get on that
it will be a slow process but what I'll
do is I'll make a I'll make a G a Google
Docs spreadsheet and just make it public
and we'll find a place to post that
somewhere yeah we'll post that somewhere
so then if you want to if you want to
see it you can reference the public
Google Docs of our spreadsheet and we'll
find a way to like cross out stuff so
that'll be great that sounds like a
great idea yes yeah leftover beefcake I
will make that available on Google Drive
so then you know we can cross off games
that we've already played and you can
see all the games we own and on all the
formats
I'm really sorry everybody who just got
apparently people are just getting the
email god you gotta check the twits you
gotta check the tweets why would the
email be sent out so late in twitch it
happens sometimes my my many apologies
