Jack: All right. Here we go. Mad Max.
Rich: What? What?
Jack: I don't...
Rich: That's terrible.
Jack: I just don't, I, you just, I...
Rich: Everything about that was horrible.
Jack: I just don't, I, I just don't...Rich, I just don't. Do wish there was a faster run.
Rich: Is there a car?
Jack: Maybe. I don't know.
Rich: Assuming there might be something you drive in this game.
Jack: Maybe.
Rich: People are saying, dammit, now can't change your stats. Other people are saying your stats are fine.
Jack: My, I didn't wanna change my stats. My stats are fine. I know you guys are saying, like, the stats I chose didn't mesh well with, like, the ups I chose, but that's, hey, that's just how we're doing it.
Rich: Okay.
Jack: That's, cuz that's Furiosa. She, she's a complicated woman.
Rich: I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Jack: I don't. I just don't, Rich. That's the real thing. I don't, and I don't want to.
Rich: But, I think this apocalypse has...
Jack: End of story.
Rich: ...indistinguishable from just any, like, a slummy area in Texas.
Jack: If you've, if, if anyone has ever driven between California and Las Vegas, this is just what it looks like now. You know, this is just modern day, what that looks like. So...yeah, it's, it's pretty good, though. They got mutants. Can only assume I'm heading back to the le-, to Sunny. There's a cart. Let's go look at the cart. Something in the cart?
Rich: Can you drive the cart? Can you throw an engine on the cart and drive it around?
Jack: Wouldn't that be great? Pick up cart. Nope. Okay. Okay. Onward to the lady. She's the lady I know. Did I really go this far away from town? Apparently.
Rich: Is that the same town?
Jack: I don't know. I think I'm supposed to go to this...well, I mean, I'm going to the big arrow. I don't know where I'm supposed to go. There's a big arrow that says, hey, dummy, come over here. And I need that. Oh, hey. There's a lady.
Rich: Chat is saying nice ass.
Jack: Yeah. That's why I'm choosing the third-person perspective, I wanna let you know. Talk to Sunny. Okay.
Rich: You are in the same outfit. Is that awkward in the post-apocalypse?
Jack: Uh, I just wanna let you know that I really respect you, and I'm wearing the top half out of respect for you. Healing power. Skill requirement.
Rich: Can you get your own dog?
Jack: I, I assume. How many? One. Yay!
Rich: Oh, crafting.
Jack: Cr-, yep.
Rich: I don't like crafting in games. I'm just saying.
Jack: Yeah?
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: I, I think...
Rich: It's tedious and annoying.
Jack: I think thematically, it's appropriate, though, for a game like this.
Rich: Sure.
Jack: You're in the apocalypse. You're ge-, you know, getting scraps everywhere. All right. That's Cheyenne.
Rich: Crafting just feels like an extra step a game is making me take.
Jack: Yeah, but it, it also makes exploring more meaningful, because you just wanna grab all the stuff you can. And I wanna say in this game, there's like a weight thing.
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: So if you're holding too much stuff, you move slower.
Rich: Okay. Okay.
Jack: And so then it's, it's like, you have to choose what you grab, and, like, oh, I might be able to craft this later. It, it adds an element. I, I, I understand it. I agree, it can be tedious, but I understand it in this game. I would like to run faster.
Rich: All the live-long day.
Jack: And, dramatic shot.
Rich: I do it all, I do it all the time in games, Like, two people are talking, and I'll, like, slow-pan around.
Jack: Yep. That's, it's actually really bothersome that I can't look at the front of her face cuz I'd love to do, like, a...
Rich: Oh, the panoramic. In the wasteland...a trailer shot. One woman...must survive.
Jack: Whaaaat?! Right? Oh, yeah. I think everyone knows does that in games. It's fun. It's a cinematic. Oh, it's getting to be nighttime. Getting to be nighttime, Rich. There's danger.
Rich: That's exciting.
Jack: There's, oh.
Rich: Do zombies start coming out of the ground all around you at night?
Jack: That's quite possible. I did heal. 
Rich: Somebody is saying there's a fast travel.
Jack: That's great. I did heal. I don't know if, I did take a sip out of my canteen, so I don't know if that helped me heal.
Rich: Okay, okay.
Jack: But I did heal, and I don't believe I did anything to heal.
Rich: Hm.
Jack: So if it is regenerating health, it's very slow regenerating health.
Rich: Hold down A stick to pan around. We're talking about the character standing still.
Jack: Oh, yeah. Like, I know you can do this, but like, if it was a third-person game, you could pan the camera and look at your character's face.
Rich: Not, not, not in a shooter.
Jack: Not in a shooter, right. Like in Bloodborne, you can look at your character's face. All right, we gotta talk to some lady now. Saving.
Rich: Can you put your gun away? Everyone just thinks you're pointing your gun at them.
Jack: Oh, I probably should put my gun away. Yeah, get outta here, sucker.
Rich: Do they do that silent protagonist shit?
Jack: Yeah, this is, you know.
Rich: That annoys me. That annoys me. When everyone else talks, and you don't...
Jack: Mm-hmm.
Rich: ...you just have text, that bothers me.
Jack: What do you mean?
Rich: It just bothers me.
Jack: This, this is why you can give it, you give a character your own voice.
Rich: I would like, I would like to have audio with it.
Jack: You can give your own voice.
Rich: If I, once I select the thing that I say, I would want the character to talk.
Jack: Oh, I dislike that more.
Rich: No, no.
Jack: You know what that is? That's redundant. I hate that, cuz then I look, and show me what you have for sale.
Rich: This, this, this takes me out of the game.
Jack: Oh.
Rich: This takes me out of the world.
Jack: I don't like redundancy in games. Hey, show me what you have for sale, after I already read show me what you have for sale.
Rich: Rich hates Gorman Freeman. Gordon Freeman's not a character.
Jack: Nope. He's you. All right. 
Rich: See, she's talking to herself. It, it, that just annoys me.
Jack: No, cuz then in my head, I can, I can put my own voice to who's, who's that man. I don's wanna, I don't wanna read the text, understand what it means, and then have someone else hear it. That just wastes my time. But I don't wanna say that. I do care about your radio. I, but I also wanna know where those guys go. I don't like, you know, I don't like that. Uh....hahaha.
Rich: And Krieger783 just signed his death warrant in the chat.
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: He just said Half-Life is piss. I think, I think they're going to tear hip apart like rabid wolves.
Jack: I mean, Krieger, you're...you're wrong. And that's fine. 
Rich: I have no strong opinion. I actually missed out on Half-Life. Half-Life came, at the time Half-Life came out, my computer wasn't up to snuff.
Jack: Sure.
Rich: And by the time I did have a computer up to snuff, there were other games I was playing.
Jack: Ah.
Rich: So I actually missed out on Half-Life.
Jack: We should play it.
Rich: Yeah. I know. I'm not shy. This is all predictable.
Jack: This is all predictable. I know. I know. I'm trying, I'm trying to get as much of the, uh...
Rich: When you, when you told them you wanted to play Fallout: New Vegas, I'm just thinking in my head, well, this is gonna work out horribly. Okay. It's fine. Whatever. Okay. We'll do it.
Jack: It's fine. I just wanna, you know, I'm, I'm trying to get as much of the story as I can to get me to the next part of the game. All right. Whoa. You're right here. Let's see here, um...the Primm. 
Rich: You know as well as I do that Jack just wants to shoot things.
Jack: I, that's all I wanna do is shoot things. What are my...where can I look at my quests? Data. Here we go. Quests. Here they are. All right.
Rich: I don't understand this, finding a new quest.
Jack: Oh, I was, I was hoping one of these things would tell me, uh, where, uh...
Rich: What's, what's your plan? What are you doing? What's going on?
Jack: I wanna find the robot that saved me. That's my plan right now.
Rich: There was a robot that saved you?
Jack: There was a robot that saved me.
Rich: That sounds fucking awesome.
Jack: I know, and I wanna meet him. And I guess I gotta go back in and talk to that lady about that robot that saved me. Goddammit. All right. Get outta my way. Get outta my way.
Rich: Jack, you wanted to play the talky-talk RPG.
Jack: I...
Rich: I have no sympathy.
Jack: No, I'm not, I'm not asking for sympathy. I'm not asking for sympathy.
Rich: Okay. You are starting to sound generally frustrated, though.
Jack: You know...where'd that lady go? Is she in the can? Are you in the can? No. Where'd you go? Where'd that fucking lady go? All right. Maybe  I need to talk to you.
Rich: Oh, wait. The radio will cause the game to get flagged on YouTube.
Jack: Oh, yeah. I see that. Um...now that lady's gone. Hold on. Let me turn my radio off. Busted radio. Oh, those are exits. Oh, cuz I'm in the saloon. Right. Uh, dammit. Someone tell me where to find the robot.
Rich: Jack wants to know where to find a robot. Somebody help Jack find a robot.
Jack: Tell me if I find a robot. There's a house with lights...no, that's the house I came in on.
Rich: Maybe you can't find the robot immediately, if there's more questing that goes on before then.
Jack: I guess I could just follow the arrow. I don't know if, what is that...that little arrow, that little arrow go. The fuck is that little arrow.
Rich: I don't know. I'm sure it'll come up again.
Jack: Sure. Wait, what's the big arrow? What's my main quest here? Offer to help Ringo deal with the Powder Gangster. Sure. Sure, we'll do that. That will be my main quest. Oh, yeah. Ringo's in the gas station. Hey, Ringo! Great. I got some sarsparilla. Ringo. Ringo...
Rich: When did this come out?
Jack: I have no idea. Ask the chat.
Rich: Cuz I was gonna say, it looks relatively bad, just visually.
Jack: I mean, I think it was a while ago.
Rich: I dunno if that's the floaty-ness because you're doing it in third-person.
Jack: Sure.
Rich: Jack, Jack is annoyed by the talking...that he has to do in this role-playing game. You can hear the, the, the audible frustration in his voice, even though he's not vocalizing his frustration. You can hear it from, like, his breathing.
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: You can somehow hear it in his posture.
Jack: It's a, it's a, it's a tough thing with a role-playing game, cuz like, what if my character is different. My character doesn't wanna hear all this bullshit.
Rich: Well, why don't you try shooting him?
Jack: Ooh.
Rich: Just go off the rails. Go off-script, Jack.
Jack: Nice.
Rich: Try shooting him. Just say, I'll consider it, and then go into VATS, aim for his head, get that first shot off.
Jack: All right.
Rich: If you're not having fun, and this becomes a frustrating stream, we may as well, we may as well mix it up a bit. Like, can you pick his pocket, just get his gun? No, you can't?
Jack: Nah. Oh, but he's just laying there. He's not moving. Why is not a 100% shot? He's not moving. Can I get closer? We'll save first. Let's just ee what happens.
Rich: Crouch. Somebody is saying crouch first. There you go. Pickpocket.
Jack: You've lost karma. Outta here.
Rich: See, this is exciting. Get his gunarm.
Jack: Oh!
Rich: He dropped the gun!
Jack: Can't shoot me now, bitch! Hey!
Rich: Oh, he's got another gun.
Jack: He's got another gun. I need to build up some more points.
Rich: Ya gotta fight.
Jack: Huh?
Rich: They build up pretty quick. Take a chance on a headshot.
Jack: You think?
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Another headshot?
Rich: Yeah, why not.
Jack: I only get one. Ringo head crippled, yet he can still shoot me.
Rich: What the fuck.
Jack: Bobbing and weaving. Bobbing and weaving! There we go. Now we can get two shots on him. Head. Go arm again. Head, reload, right arm. Ooh, fuck! I just blew his fucking head off! You take a sip from your vault canteen. Yeah, gimme all the rest of your shit. Boom.
Rich: All right. Do you like the game better now?
Jack: Yeah, now I'm having fun. Ooh, what's this?
Rich: That's an empty.
Jack: It's an empty. Empty whiskey bottle. I don't want an empty whiskey bottle.
Rich: But if you find whiskey, you can probably put whiskey in the whiskey bottle.
Jack: Yeah, but if I find whiskey, I'll just drink it. All right. Let's get out of here, Rich. Fuck this town. Fuck Ringo. Fuck everyone.
Rich: Are you just gonna go on a murder spree?
Jack: That's kind of my plan. Where am I going here? World map. Northern Passage? Goodsprings, Goodsprings Cemetary. Canyon Wreckage. Oh, wait. That's where they found me. Let's head that way.
Rich: You're not a very nice man.
Jack: I'm, I'm, I'm a lady. And I'm not a very nice lady.
Rich: Yeah, but if you're a lady, you're technically also not a very nice man.
Jack: That...Rich. Invaluable logic. Ooh, look. There's, like, a deer or something. Let's shoot that. Look, there's a deer or something. I'm gonna shoot it. And if we find a robot on the way...so I've lost a bunch of karma.
Rich: Oh, that's fine.
Jack: That's fine.
Rich: I don't think you care about karma.
Jack: I don't care about karma. I can only imagine, like, karma affects how people treat me, or whatever.
Rich: I'm assuming if you murder enough people, people will avoid talking to you and avoid you.
Jack: Great.
Rich: Which, I think, is fine by you.
Jack: That's exactly what I want. I don't want people to talk to me. Bitches get stitches, if you know what I'm saying. And you know who's bitches? People who talk. All right. Am I getting there? Yeah. Great. Oh, there he is. Oh, ha. Tumbleweed friend. This is my, this is my pet tumbleweed. It'll fuck you up.
Rich: Tumbly.
Jack: This is Tumbly, my tumbleweed.
Rich: Tubular.
Jack: We gonna take him with us. Tumbly. You nailed that on your first try. Come on, Tumbly. You coming with me to the next town. Oop. Come here. Fucking tumbleweed moves faster, fuck, fuck you, Tumbly. You think you're better than me?
Rich: Tumbly's afraid you'll shoot him.
Jack: Tumbly, you better, you damn right, Tumbly. Watch yourself. Watch yourself. This way. I should mark it.
Rich: You wanna pause the game for a second?
Jack: Uh, yes.
Rich: Wanna do something?
Jack: Okay. Do something.
Rich: BlakaShimu, VanPastel, MCLucs, ElvisDelvis, we really appreciate it. GayforJay, HallsVarietyPack, PerfectDark, CrackerMan526, JackNoticesDudes, PapaZuzu, Striker1121, CKBZzyzn, whatever the fuck, BarkeleyDC, paul_blarp_mall_blarp, and bonodoug...
Jack: Bon Gadoug.
Rich: ...thank you for subscribing. We really appreciate it.
Jack: It's true. We really do.
Rich: All right. Go.
Jack: There we go.
Rich: Business is taken care of.
Jack: Business. Business is good. Continue. All right. Place marker. Yeah. All right. Now we gotta, now we got an arrow leading this boy. All right. All right. Let's go to the canyon and kill some people. That's all I care about in the post-apocalypse.
Rich: Somebody is saying you can mod in sprinting.
Jack: Ooh. Now that's a useful...
Rich: It's twice as fast and uses up action points.
Jack: Oh, interesting.
Rich: I like that.
Jack: It almost seems...is that, what are the tiny arrows? Maybe, uh, like, enemies?
Rich: Hold X to put away, gun away, and run faster.
Jack: Oh. Oh, look at that.
Rich: Thank you.
Jack: Thank you. These are important things to know. Oh, to run faster, ho ho ho.
Rich: Yes, we were, we were reading subs, newbie. Newbie. Piloted donut noob.
Jack: Wow, Rich. Oh.
Rich: Just, fuck it, Jack. He's a noob. He doesn't get respect.
Jack: Wow.
Rich: He doesn't get respect till at least four or five streams. That's how it works.
Jack: All right. I mean, that's fine. That's, uh, that's how you play in it.
Rich: Somebody else says, I think you can pan around your character when your weapon is stowed.
Jack: Ooh, that's, we'll, you know what, we will check that out as soon...
Rich: You can have, you can have your epic panorama shot. He's dead.
Jack: Nope. 
Rich: Should be. Oh, you didn't have enough action points. Oh, no. I'm assuming there's a stat that will give you more action points, or faster recharging.
Jack: Fucking, how many hits do these fuckers take? Nope. All right. Shoot that. Let's try hitting you for this shit, too. Hunting geckos. Oh, you're not dead yet. All right.
Rich: Yeah, since you hate the dialogue, it seems like you should've went for a character with low intelligence.
Jack: That's what they were telling me.
Rich: Yeah. But you didn't.
Jack: Nope. Because I don't listen. Really? Right, fucking in the head.
Rich: What kind of gun is Rich using? Well, I am not using any guns, as I am not playing the game.
Jack: Gecko meat. I think I need to eat meat. Because my health is low. Let's eat meat! Uh, items. Bloatfly meat.
Rich: Seems like you should lose...
Jack: Right?
Rich: ...health by eating the bloatfly meat.
Jack: What is that rad per second?
Rich:: Radioactive.
Jack:: Oh, yay. There you go. Fuck it. I'll be radioactive. How'd that do? That did, that not aid me much. Let's try some, eating some more shit. Gecko meat. HP plus one. Ooh, I have some healing powder. Ah, that's good enough for now. Where am I going? This way.
Rich: You can cook the meat at the campfire.
Jack: Oh.
Rich: So you can't eat raw meat is what they're saying.
Jack: Oh, I ate it all already.
Rich: Oh, you can. Maybe you just don't get as much health from it.
Jack: Maybe. Bloatfly meat has worn off. Great.
Rich: Soil says it's fine. The radiation has burned all the diseases away.
Jack: That's funny. I think the things you say is funny. Welcome to level two. Yay!
Rich: Yay!
Jack: Oh, yeah. We're great at unarmed combat.
Rich: You're using a shotgun.
Jack: But I'm using a shotgun.
Rich: You can try unarmed combat.
Jack: That's a good idea. I'm gonna, even melee weapons I'm great at. Um, what do we want?
Rich: Guns are a mere eighteen.
Jack: Right? Let's add one to guns. Let's add all of 'em to guns. All right. There. Repair. To maintain any weapons. Allows you to create items. Oh. Yeah. That, that sounds good. Speak. If I could take away stuff from speak, I would.
Rich: Sneak.
Jack: Medicine.
Rich: Sneak. 
Jack: Great, and...
Rich: Hello, MrStribster.
Jack: Mr. what?
Rich: He said hello. He said, hey Rich and Jack.
Jack: Hi! Welcome to level two.
Rich: It only took us three hours.
Jack: Swift learner, come on. With each rank in the swift learner perk, you'll gain an additional 10% of total experience points whenever experience points are earned. Well, that seems nice. Uh...ooh, do more damage against female opponents. More damage, well, I like that swift learner. That seemed to, uh, be good. Oh, I can choose another one, too. Um...no. Only one. Great. Done. Great. Let's, uh, let's choose a different weaon. I have a cleaver.
Rich: Gonna take a cleaver over a machete, huh?
Jack: I got a cleaver.
Rich: Okay.
Jack: Give it a try, at least. Oh, I can just walk right up these rocks. That's great.
Rich: Somebody, somebody wants to know, if this is your first video game.
Jack: This is my first video game ever. It's true. It's my first video game ever, and so far, you know, I'm all right with it. Can't walk up that rock. Probably gotta go around all these rocks. Can I go up this rock?
Rich: Somebody says, you've fucked yourself, Jack. You leveled the resistance of Fallout.
Jack: I don't care. How about that? How about that? Ooh, I take a sip from my canteen. Great. I leveled the resistance of Fallout? What did I level?
Rich: Swift learner.
Jack: Swift learner?
Rich: What did that one do?
Jack: No, that, that gave me more, uh, experience points, 10% more experience points.
Rich: Okay.
Jack: No. Why would you go to that one?
Rich: With the damage, doing it at distance with the melee weapon, probably not very good.
Jack: All right. Well, let's see what happens.
Rich: This might not be the best...VATS with a melee weapon might be just kind of a moot point. You might wanna just whack at things right now.
Jack: Okay.
Rich: With your whack at things button. Oh, maybe that's not working. I take that back.
Jack: Aughh!
Rich: Go back to VATS. You need more guns.
Jack: Apparently, I need more guns. I can whack at him nine times, or three times, though, so that's nothing. Doesn't seem to work neither. Ooh, there's a big one. Where's my machete?
Rich: Someone says melee weapons are overpowered. You're gonna do fine with them.
Jack: I, you know what, I'm, I'm gonna put this out there, I just don't think that's true. In my, in using a melee weapon twice now...where is he? Come here. You dick.
Rich: Is he fleeing?
Jack: He's fleeing.
Rich: Can you have two different weapons that you can switch between? That would seem to make sense if you could switch between a gun and a melee weapon.
Jack: That would be nice.
Rich: There was some, I thought I saw something in the menu for RB to quickswitch. Let's set it up first?
Jack: Oh, sure. Let's check it out. Okay, um, what do I have? My shotgun. My shotgun.
Rich: Hotkey, right button.
Jack: My shot-, oh, there it is.
Rich: Oh, you can put it on the D-pad. That's fine. Or, the number pad. That's...computer?
Jack: Sure. Okay, so that's my shotgun. And I could put, like, my 10mm down there. Let's see what happens. Hey. 
Rich: You can do it with the D-pad?
Jack: I can do it with the D-pad.
Rich: All right.
Jack: Aughh! Not what I wanted to do. I want my machete back. Broad machete.
Rich: You can, FlynnTheJinx says you can do fine damage with whatever weapon style you invest perks and skill points into. Melee gets really fun at higher levels, and doesn't cost ammo.
Jack: Oh, sure. Great. I'll keep, we'll keep giving it hell. Ooh.
Rich: Somebody else says, uh, get him to go to sleep so the health restores.
Jack: Oh, yeah?
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: There was a thing. How long would you like to wait? An hour.
Rich: Is that how long you normally sleep?
Jack: I don't  know. Does that, is that what happened?
Rich: I dunno. You didn't gain any health. Try eight hours.
Jack: Eight hours?
Rich: That's what normal sleep is like.
Jack: We'll go six.
Rich: Okay.
Jack: I didn't gain any health.
Rich: Nope.
Jack: I think you're full of shit.
Rich: Waiting is not sleeping.
Jack: Waiting is not sleeping. Maybe that's it. Then how the fuck...
Rich: Why would they give you the option to do one and not the other?
Jack: Then how the fuck do you sleep?
Rich: Why do those need to be two different controls? I don't understand things.
Jack: How do you sleep?
Rich: You need a bed to sleep.
Jack: Fuck you, you need a bed to sleep.
Rich: They want you to find a bed.
Jack: You find a bed. I'll just eat more meat.
Rich: There's probably one in the town. There, I found you a bed. Yeah, you're low on health. Just jump off that cliff.
Jack: That's fine.
Rich: You'll be fine. You, you gonna kill him? Are you gonna try to kill him while you're low on health?
Jack: Oh, he's fine.
Rich: Cuz he didn't annoy you enough talking.
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: Okay.
Jack: You can now fast travel. Yay! Great. No, he did not annoy me. If you get over this fucking mountain.
Rich: Oh, you can take a bed with you? You killed that guy earlier. He doesn't need that bed anymore. 
Jack: That would be great.
Rich: If you had, like, a roll-up bed you could take with, that would make sense.
Jack: Yeah, like a, like a napsack. Like a sleeping bag. Like a camping, sleeping bag kind of thing. Who's over here? Jump. Ooh, there's a tent. What's in the tent? Hey, dude. Great. Can I go in? Sleep. How long would you like to sleep? Six hours.
Rich: Somebody thinks this is boring as fuark.
Jack: Yeah, fuarks kinda boring. Hey, there's my health. Great.
Rich: Half, half the people love the Fallouts.
Jack: I think people love playing with Fallouts. I don't think they like watching other people play the Fallouts. Or I'm just so bad.
Rich: What's, what's the consensus, chat?
Jack: I think it's, it's also, like, the fact that I don't really care about what's happening...
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: ...is, um, uh, means that I'm not, like, as enthusiastic about the game, so I'm not being as entertaining. That could also be a thing.
Rich: So what you're saying is this is not a game you are going to go home and play?
Jack: I can't imagine I'm gonna go play the game. I don't like the talkies.
Rich: I know you don't. That's why I was shocked you wanted to play this.
Jack: Ah, people, uh, I, you know what, I just, I wanted some, it was so long since I played Fallout 3, and everyone's talking about Fallout 4, I wanted some frame of reference for, like, what the game is.
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: You know? So, it's done that for me. It's, like, all right. If this is the kind of game it is, it's probably just not a game for me. Ah, here we go. Here we go. Getting to the caravan. I'm gonna machete some motherfuckers. I'm gonna machete motherfuckers in the face. Ooh, frag grenade. Yes. Yes. What's that? Pork n' beans? Fuck yeah, I'll take some pork n' beans. Oh, empty. It, it says it's empty.
Rich: Oh, that's good.
Jack: Great. All right. All right. We got some grenades. We got some pork n' beans. Yeah, actually, this seems like a game that you would really be into, Rich, which is why I was surprised that you weren't, you said you weren't really into it.
Rich: I'm, this, this, cuz stream is a terrible place to experience a story-based game with lots of talking. This is the kind of game you would need to spend your own time getting into it.
Jack: Oh, yeah. Well, I'm surp-, I'm just surprised you, you haven't, is what I'm saying.
Rich: They make a lot of games.
Jack: They do make a lot of games. That's true. I see...
Rich: And thanks to JRPG's, I, I, I, I don't bother, I, I don't flock to, I'm, like, reluctant to get into any kind of RPG.
Jack: Sure.
Rich: Because when I think of, when I think of RPG, unfortunately, thanks to SquareSoft, I, I think of, like, spikey-haired, fifteen-year old, obnoxious Japanese children with blue hair.
Jack: Sure.
Rich: And convoluted storytelling. And bad stories.
Jack: I just noticed something great.
Rich: Being railroaded into a series of events that I have no control over, and a lousy combat system. These are all things I just associate naturally with RPG's.
Jack: Sure. Sure. Check this out. I just discovered something. Look at the coyote pups health. 
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Do you see how all of the health bar is down?
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Which means if I make the shot, I kill him in one hit.
Rich: Yeah. 
Jack: I didn't notice that. So that's how you know if you're gonna kill someone.
Rich: Okay.
Jack: Which is neat.
Rich: Well, you don't know how much damage that hit's gonna take off.
Jack: Yeah, the, the, you do.
Rich: Oh. Oh, it says how much?
Jack: It says how much. Uh, like, with the mom coyote that I killed, because I, I did, I killed the mom. I killed this family of coyotes. Uh, because I'm a heartless bastard. Um, here, we'll see when we fight our next, uh, bigger...
Rich: Hold on, chat. Octosays, turn-based combat isn't lousy. JRPG turn-based combat is lousy. And I know all RPG's aren't like JRPG's. It's just, it's just a bad taste in my mouth with those early JRPG's. I have, like, notions in my head that I know aren't always true, but when I think of RPG's, I think of JRPG's, and it's a bad thought.
Jack: Sure. Sure. Here, oh, there's a bit coyote. You'll see. You'l lsee about this whole health system. 
Rich: It's like, it's like imprinted, or something. 
Jack: Yeah, no. I mean, you, it's association.
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: You've associated, you know, RPG's only with JRPG's. Come here.
Rich: Because that's what an RPG was when I was younger.
Jack: See, so, do you see now the flashing happening?
Rich: Oh, down at the bottom.
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: Oh. Okay.
Jack: So then if I say, hit 'em once, and look, if I hit 'em again...
Rich: Oh.
Jack: ...and then I can hit 'em again.
Rich: That's nice.
Jack: And then I kill 'em.
Rich: That's nice.
Jack: That's very helpful. I'm learning. And then I smack 'em. Fuck, yeah. Critical strike. I am learning. Fuck you, coyote. Come here, let me take your meat. Fall off this cliff, then I'm gonna fucking eat you. You're mine, now. You're mine. Take your hide, too. Can I wear his coyote hide? Look at you, motherfucker. Come here. Coyote den mother. Like I give a shit. And your pup, too.
Rich: Aww. Can't you just sneak by 'em. Do you have to kill these poor dogs? Trying to make a living as best they can in this horrible world.
Jack: Uh, I guess I did. I guess I did have to do that. Search the pup. Eat the meat. Now I'm gonna eat your meat. Great. Let's see what's down this road. I can't go down the thing yet. It said I need to be, like, level 25 to go down the thing. So, I'm just gonna go over here and look for people to kill.
Rich: What do I think of Jennifer Connelly? Uh, one of the most attractive women who has ever lived. 
Jack: Uh, sure. I'll give you that. I like that Jennifer Connelly. What has she been doing lately?
Rich: No idea.
Jack: Has she been acting?
Rich: No idea.
Jack: That Jennifer Connelly been acting?
Rich: Haven't, haven't seen her in anything for a while.
Jack: Yeah, it's been a while. I wanna take that thing off my map now. Need a remove marker.
Rich: Are they following the story at all? No, Jack is not following the story at all.
Jack: I, I kind of know what's going on. I kind of know what's going on. Kinda.
Rich: Wasn't she in Ang Lee's The Hulk. I haven't seen Ang Lee's The Hulk.
Jack: She was in Ang Lee's The Hulk. But that was...
Rich: That everyone said was terrible. I avoided it.
Jack: Nah, it's fine. I liked it. I liked it better than The Incredible Hulk. Than Edward Norton's Hulk. It at least, at least it had some style to it. Ang Lee's Hulk. The ending was a bit pretentious.
Rich: Yes, I know she was in Dark City. That's one of my favorite movies, Dark City. Dark City is excellent.
Jack: Oh. Hey, here's a guy. Can I kill you? Why, I can kill you.
Rich: Roger Ebert liked Dark City so much, he did a commentary track for it. 
Jack: Aughh! Oh, I'm gonna fucking kill you.
Rich: Zero percent.
Jack: Yeah, but look at his health bar. I dunno, let's just see what happens.
Rich: Weird. Weird.
Jack: That it would say zero percent?
Rich: Yes.
Jack: Yes. I'm gonna kill you with my machete. I'm gonna kill you with my machete.
Rich: Jennifer Connelly, what brought her up? Somebody in the chat was asking me about Jennifer Connelly. Kind of an odd question out of nowhere. But, glad to answer it.
Jack: Hey, I've gained karma somehow.
Rich: You probably killed a bad man.
Jack: Oh, these are convicts. Ooh, great. Can I, um, can I double-wield, dual-wield, uh, can I dual-wield machetes? That would be awesome.
Rich: I'm gonna say no.
Jack: Probably.
Rich: Because then it would just be silly.
Jack: Like, these, these guys had cleavers, and I'd love to have two cleavers. Just a cleaver in each fist. All right. Hey, I did it. I killed some people. Got my karma back. And I killed him with my machete. I officially love killing people with a machete. Whoa. What's happening? Somebody's shooting at me. There he is. Not that one. This one. Jackal gang leader. You're going down. Um, are you too close? Now you're gonna be too far, oh, no, now you don't. Oh, you're reloading? That sucks. Cuz now I'm gonna murder you. Yay! Murder! 
Rich: You just hacked their heads off.
Jack: I did. Now I'm gonna take all your shit...ooh, a butcher knife. Now I'm gonna take all your shit. It's my shit now. It's my shit now. Now where are you coming from? Over here? What's over here? Were you guarding a treasure? Were you guarding a secret treasure?
Rich: Guarding some silly police cars.
Jack: Yay, look at those silly-looking police cars. Fuck you. All right. Fuck you. Oh, shit! All right, well...
Rich: You'll just have to kill them.
Jack: That's fine. Oh. Ow. Oh, there's a thing in here, too. Stop being so close to me.
Rich: She's a melee girl.
Jack: Great. And now you're a dead melee girl.
Rich: It's kind of weird when everyone has the same fucking jacket.
Jack: Well, that's the area we're in is, like, the jacket area.
Rich: Yeah, but it's the apocalypse. They mass-produced these beat-up jackets?
Jack: Well, they're leather. They're, the, leather is very strong.
Rich: But they look the same. You can make something out of leather that looks different.
Jack: I suppose. All right. Great.
Rich: You need to not die. You're low on health.
Jack: That's fine. Find a place to sleep. Ooh, a stimpack. I think that's, like, health.
Rich: Can you be murdered while you're sleeping?
Jack: Mm...
Rich: If you could, that would, that, if you could, that would be both annoying and great.
Jack: I agree. Hold on. I need to eat something, I think. If I eat stuff. Oh, it looks like there's bad guys in the next room.
Rich: Rich, what does Mike love so much about The Rocketeer? Uh, everything about it. I love it, too. It's just a very solid superhero movie. We both love that movie independently of one another because I didn't know Mike when I first saw The Rocketeer. When I was a kid, I fucking loved The Rocketeer, and it flopped in the theaters. But, as it, like, proba-, possibly my favorite movie that summer.
Jack: Yeah?
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Mm. All right.
Rich: Solid story. Solid characters. Some art deco goodness. That, I mean, that, that fucking helmet, that outfit.
Jack: The outfit is fantastic.
Rich: It's fucking gorgeous.
Jack: The outfit is genuinely fantastic.
Rich: Everything about that costume. That rocket pack looks great. Jennifer Connelly is in it.
Jack: Jennifer Connelly. That did not do much to, to raise my health. I'll tell you that.
Rich: It's fine.
Jack: Let's just get it up a little bit more. Yeah, all these things, like, raise my health, health one point.
Rich: Rich, did you play or like Dark Void? Kinda similar to Rocketeer. No, not, that's, uh, similar in that you have a helmet and a backpack, but that's kind of about it. Hellmet, backpack, and kind of, pretty much the same time period, but, like, Dark Void, you're flying around in alternate dimension weirdness. And gameplay is kind of bad. Kind of, kind of mediocre more than bad. Dark Void is highly mediocre. They didn't integrate the flying backpack with the shooting mechanics enough. It's, like, two different games cuz you're gonna have to, I mean, they made a, they made a game you fly around with a jet, jetpack, but there's a lot of ground-based cover shooting, which doesn't mesh at all with the concept of running around with a jetpack.
Jack: Sure.
Rich: Jack's, Jack's picking a lock. He hasn't, he didn't hear a word I said. Jack, use, use a stimpack for the love of god. A stimpack, exclamation point. Rich, with your beard on the Broken Age review, you look like a down-on-his-luck Jay. Well, fuck you, too.
Jack: Honestly, that's a terrible thing to say.
Rich: Food heals you over time. It heals one HP per second. 
Jack: Great. I'll use a stimpack. There. Oh, yeah. That did, that did a much better job healing me. Where are all these bad guys I see?
Rich: Oh, god. He's not going to open this door.
Jack: I did it. No, I did it.
Rich: Oh, okay.
Jack: I, I opened the door. It, it took me, it took me a little bit. All right. Close the door. Come here. Oh, all right. All right. Who's in here? Some bitches? Oh, some of these things. I love using the VATS system for the tiny little guys. I think it's hilarious. Okay. Bottlecaps. What, what?! I'm sure this is all very in-depth and wonderful.
Rich: If they find it hard, if they find it hard to play talkie Fallout, they won't be able to get through Witcher 3. I love it how you're playing, and everything is they. They, they, they, they, they.
Jack: And, also, you've gone out of your way to be, like, Jack, I knew this wasn't a game for you, that's why you're playing, you're, Jack, you're playing with a controller because I would never do that. Jack is playing this and Jack has troubles with these games. So, yes.
Rich: We are, we are now cursed to be lumped together, no matter what.
Jack: No matter what. You know, Rich and I have very different opinions about games. I know we, we agree, we have agreed on most of our episodes, but overall...
Rich: Which is weird.
Jack: It is weird. Isn't it?
Rich: Yes.
Jack: But what do I wanna do next?
Rich: We've had minor disagreements, like, I've been, I've been mediocre on things that you have loved.
Jack: Yeah, that's true.
Rich: And vice versa, probably.
Jack: Mm-hmm. Left button. How do I mod you? Apparently, I don't. Yeah, so, it's just, like, Jack has a problem with this, um, because I don't like the talkies. I think Rich would actually really enjoy this game, so much so that it really surprised me when, uh, when I heard he hasn't played it. I, I assumed this would kind of be right up his alley. Ant meat. What? Beer. Take it. Just gonna take all this shit. Great. No, I, and you know, like, I think there was a time in my life where I could have gotten into a game like this...ooh...you know?
Rich: Mm-hmm.
Jack: I just don't know if I have the time anymore.
Rich: You mean, as far as, like, talking in games? I'm the one who refuses to skip a cutscene, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
Jack: Yeah. That's Rich. I think Rich would really enjoy this game.
Rich: I might. I might.
Jack: I heard some great things about Witcher 3, but...
Rich: I know the first one, though, the combat just gave me such a sour taste.
Jack: Witcher?
Rich: Yeah. The first one.
Jack: Ah, okay. All right. I think we beat the bandits. But, yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm...
Rich: And it wasn't, it wasn't any kind of talking in the Witcher 1 that turned me off. It was the combat system.
Jack: I'm still working on beating Bloodborne, for Christ's sake. I ain't got no time for Witcher. Ooh, what's that guy?
Rich: Why are so many people shit-talking this stream? Because Europe.
Jack: Yeah, just Europe?
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: All right.
Rich: Oh, my god. That's hideous.
Jack: Uh, dead. Now that I've figured out...
Rich: Oh, my god. That is really giant.
Jack: ...a little bit more about the combat, I, I feel a little more, uh, confident
Rich: Why aren't there a billion more, if it's an ant?
Jack: No wonder that guy had ant meat. And I was like, ohh...
Rich: There will be nothing worse than giant ants. I know they've made movies about this.
Jack: Yeah? Oh, I wonder if you can ride 'em? Like, ride the giant ant into battle. Tally ho!
Rich: Ants, ants are just frightening.
Jack: Giant ants are frightening?
Rich: Yes.
Jack: Ooh, bark scorpion poison gland. I wonder what that is. I could use that. More giant ants. And, death! Critical strike. Yay! I took his fucking head off.
Rich: Rich, have you ever been to Europe? I can barely afford to cross the street.
Jack: I've seen you cross the street at least once. It was pretty exciting for all of us. Oh, and see when, like, your crosshair gets over 'em, it turns red. That's when you know you can hit 'em. That's fun. Auggh, fuck! Fuck! There's a big one.
Rich: Doohickey2 says, guns, for the love of god, guns!
Jack: I don't give a fuck. I'm hitting ants with a machete. What's more fun than hitting ants with a machete? Look at this.
Rich: Shooting, shooting ants with a shotgun.
Jack: That might be fun. I am hacking ants to pieces with a machete, and I think that's fun. This is how I'm playing the game. Gathering all the ant meat I can. Ooh. What is happening? Why did I start crouching?
Rich: Uh, The Rocketeer will not be the next RLM commentary track.
Jack: You don't think?
Rich: I don't think. I, I, I, in fact, I know it's not going to be the next commentary.
Jack: What-what-what?
Rich: I started slow walking for some reason.
Jack: Rich, what did you want to do as a career originally? Uh, lottery winner. That was the, that was the first thing I wanted to do.
Rich: Yeah?
Jack: That's hard to, that's hard to break into, though.
Rich: Oh.
Jack: Yeah, yeah. It's a tough field. Lot of people looking to get in.
Rich: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Lot of competition.
Jack: I haven't tried just punching an ant. Maybe I should try punching an ant. Obviously, I need to be better at lockpicking.
Rich: Seriously, Rich. Reconsider your trash-talking of Europe. I'm not trash-talking Europe. I'm having a bit of fun. It's like when I talk about soccer, and how awful soccer is. You know, I really don't care if Europeans like such a horrible sport. This is all in good fun.
Jack: It's, uh, it's a universal sport. It's, uh...
Rich: It's the universal sport of boring.
Jack: Everybody kicks a ball, and, and, uh, it's also a very affordable sport, you know.
Rich: Yeah. And you get to, get to watch the ball just kind of go around a little field, and nothing exciting happens.
Jack: You know, you know what I would like to see in soccer?
Rich: What?
Jack: Uh, smaller nets, and no goalies. Kind of like basketball.
Rich: Somebody would hang back and try to kick the ball with their feet, though.
Jack: You know, you have an area where you, where you, your team couldn't go in.
Rich: Mm.
Jack: You know, you have a defender, you'd have defenders, but no, no specific goalie. And then it'd be, then ya get a little more score, a little more back and forth. I'd like that.
Rich: Just, just switch to hockey. Hockey is a lot like soccer, only at any moment you can have a heart attack cuz the game is so exciting.
Jack: I'm, I'm not one for hockey. I just poured all my weapon, all my points into melee weapons. See, look what I'm doing. Like, I'm, like, crouching. 
Rich: In, in hockey, somebody could score or die at any given moment.
Jack: Yeah?
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Why am I walking so slow?
Rich: I dunno. Storm? Does she see wind? Something's going on here.
Jack: Something is going on here, and I don't know what it is. Chat.
Rich: You're in-, oh, Jack. There's a weight thing. Your inventory is too full.
Jack: Yes, thank you. Fucking hell. All right. Let's get, let's get rid of some shit.
Rich: You're no Giles Corey. 
Jack: That, I, I don't under-, even understand what that means.
Rich: Oh, he's...he's probably one of the biggest badasses.
Jack: Oh, okay.
Rich: In the Salem Witch Trials?
Jack: Okay, I, I know that.
Rich: Is one of the accused, I believe, and, uh, they wanted him to...oh, no, they wanted him to, like, testify.
Jack: Okay.
Rich: And he didn't wanna do it because he knew it was all bullshit. And so, they, they, they, they pressed him.
Jack: They pressed him?
Rich: They, they, they took him outside, and they kept putting larger and larger rocks on him, till he agreed to, till he agreed to, uh, plea guilty or innocent, I believe.
Jack: Okay.
Rich: Which is what they wanted him to do. Uh, and, uh, when they kept asking him, do you, do you want to enter a plea, he just said, till he died, he just kept saying, more weight.
Jack: Nice. You know what, that's a badass right there. Boom. Boom. Ant meat. Okay. I just basically ate all my wolf...
