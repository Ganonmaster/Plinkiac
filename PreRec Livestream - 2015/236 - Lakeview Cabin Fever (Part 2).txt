with shotgun shells it could be I heard
a cop that time they caught the other
times it did it did cock the other times
oh no the dogs still alive
so I went that thing is up you need a
hammer toolbox hammer in the toolbox

this is programming it is what Oh on the
downstairs but you gotta be yeah there's
a murderer coming yeah yeah shotgun

Oh flares flares nice nice okay you go
only get one bullet I guess but that's
something that's fine let's understand
there's it where's your other everyone

and there's your dog I can only assume
your dog is the first to get killed
all right now I got a way through that
door why don't you crank up the why do
you have him crank up the thing
crank up one thing the caring kept that
thing that you can crank up and drop on

wonder you know like the the real
question is how many things do you need
to hit him with I don't know
okay alright no what is he gonna do it's
fun to guess gas was in the second gas
trap yeah let's let's set the gas trap
and I think you need to set the gas trap
like in the middle I had it too close to
the I had the gas trap too close to the
water I think oh oh
the I he is not oh there's an axe
where was the oh the flare gun I need
the flare gun Oh go get the axe
you need the X to get the playground
nice okay okay we got this we got this
nobody dies this will be the latest in
slasher movie
Oh button also there's a rake you're
gonna fall into the right oh you know
yeah okay thanks got the flare gun
fuck that's fine did you drop the flare
gun
yes I did you dog still around I wonder
if it's random like when he comes around
he came around like the first day I know
right I know you got unlucky or maybe we
just did a thing that triggered him we
don't know what that thing is yet poor
lady no well we triggered the eyeball
I'm using an estate here
where are you killer man right where are
you oh maybe ring the bell
Oh crows that might be the signal oh
sure sure
could be I hear doors nice nice that's
okay
oh now maybe switch to the lady he's
gonna burn for a little bit oh the dogs
on your hair you dog is an acceptable
sacrifice rich crows are the signal okay
Thank You dick neutral
okay now maybe I'm go switch to the lady
and drop the thing on him real quick
he needs a hiding spot I can't just I
was sure do this all willy-nilly Jack I
know don't let him get the ax
yeah what was in here just the music
there's a teddy bear up there waiting
waiting yeah you need to you need to
lure him
oh so much that radio fucking
oh shit
Lucas uno open
you're gonna sacrifice mustache oh yeah
someone else can do it
oh maybe get up on the zip line and you
can don't be shy damn it no oh yeah hide
under the bed they go oh son of a bitch
this sucks
oh the shotgun has a bullet it yeah okay
okay well you're down one you still have
three more people you should still be in
there right
you would die you know I don't know what
the rules of the game are ooh
blood-trail you're right oh oh he's up
to thought he's up on top they said that
your blood trail gave you away
oh I guess that makes sense oh I'm a
dead end there
why don't we any other side shit
wait no no not that way oh shit
ask him all right you got this you got
this nice I think you only have one
bullet sacrifice oh not even a sacrifice
but he's not dead yet
he's not he's hobbling on one foot oh
now he's nice and slow oh nice both of
you are hopping on one foot this is such
a horror movie do you think you can axe
an hour
no that's Reiki yes I know it is oh wait
from the trip on it yeah and then axes
fucker okay
where is he oh oh no what nope nope
oh my god this is insane is this fast as
I can go you can uh you can like double
back through that area oh my god nope
that's okay
you have to left right to left and he is
very badly hurt
yeah that area you can kind of like go
in one door and out the other and kind
of get behind him
did hitting on with that axe do nothing
yeah I think he you either missed again
or like you just can't hit him with the
axe maybe what is that uh that looks
like a paint can there's a knife you can
throw at him and we still have two
things we can drop on him nice
oh that's slowed him down a lot
she's not taking her shit nope
I don't think you guys get him drunk oh
yeah nice the old double back for a can
of beer Adam
what'd you just drink it though I can't
throw it oh that's right that's right
now this gets you drunk you need to
raise up that thing oh yeah go in that
door
yeah
nope that's my yeah you have plenty of
time I think you got to be quick on this
one I think you have to like raise up
the thing and then lure him with the
other lady and then drop it on him or
else he's gonna go in there well I don't
know I made my that nice
get the flag out of there
now there's no hiding places over there
did you know he's not no but now do you
need to like do something with his
corpse yeah hey what if we drop that
hammer so many things
oh no maybe we just find a hiding who
the fuck is that it's a second murderer
there's a second murder there's the
second murder what
Oh No
get on there lady we have to kill two
it's just not gonna happen it's not
gonna happen it's not gonna happen
yeah I missed the axe I was going for
the axe oh my god this is great this
this understands slasher movies yes this
does understand slasher movies I wish I
just wonder though if you need to be
100% in order to beat the game I have no
idea and that would suck
that's not a bad idea the first killer
you might want to throw his corpse in
the wood chipper really yeah oh he's
fast this is the only thing I can think
yep wow wow wow wow I don't know can
this be done can this be done you your
dog and your friends are dead okay it's
not helping anybody that backpack that
just gets me naked I can throw that I
need an axe does get you a knife I'm
sure there's something useful on the
backpack huh but I already got that now
do ya efficiency is the key that's kind
of bad if you have no leeway
oh he's hiding behind the cabinet do you
start directly do you see him I do oh I
wonder that's great I wonder if he
always started right there
it's really funny okay II and then this
lady pants B to make it pants fucker
pants all done
no wait what did that unlock but I just
went into my inventory yeah oh no oh no
that got the underpants no yeah no yeah
it's in your inventory go to that one
door I swear to god it'll open wait wait
what are you doing with the end of work
I don't know what's wrong with you many
things okay
no not that not that one I know they're
saying she's a boy we had her naked she
seemed like a sheep the one with the
boobs okay I'm moving I'm moving she's
got the key and the key gets us protip
if the first murderer picks up the teddy
bear in the bathroom he won't hurt you
all right that seems silly leave that
down by the crate because we know the
bullets are in the crate
are you talking about sleepaway camp
yeah okay okay
I remember sleep waking Oh killer okay
just killin doesn't killer does not
appear until you go to the cabin on the
left has not appeared
yeah I understand sleepaway camp I just
don't understand why anybody would go
out of their way to reference it might
fix the board's oh right there move move
lady move it's saying he doesn't appear
to go The Last House in the left mm-hmm
I'm getting all set up over here
I'm just moving everything to the
outside Claire that's weird
I can change the day on the calendar
this is it Friday the 13th
oh wait is read it does stop on the 13th
but did you notice that I did notice
that a v8 was read that's the thing I
don't know what thing that is but it's a
thing all right that has shotgun shells
in it now don't leave it around what if
he can pick that up
he picks up these weapons you've noticed
right no he's just has an axe no no
that's the X that we get he picks it up
he had the hammer one time did he yeah
all right come on dongers we got this we
totally got this he's too good for
clothes
yeah he's natural wait I heard a door
open
you have to have three of your people
beat him to death
hide the dog somewhere can you hide the
dog look we don't know anything about
this game I hadn't even heard of this
until like 10 minutes before we started
the stream
are you trying to accent oh yeah man try
to hide the dog oh how do you hide your
dog just throw them well there's a car
behind the tree you can get into it's a
car behind the tree I just read things
okay okay regular James it did the
trailer for this game that's true I
think that's how I heard of it okay
that's great yeah I still haven't
loosened the flare gun the WASC
you're right oh there the crows there's
a rail gun on top of the big house that
you can rocket jump to did you just
waste a shotgun - Louie I absolutely did
well we're doing kind of we're kind of
doomed can I hit him just hit him with
the axe yeah I'm good so far we have not
been able to hit it just hit him with
the axe
yeah you keep trying now you have her
yay hit him with a hammer Jack oh no
nope nope nope nope
I think it's on the wrong side but turn
it on okay oh I can't you turn the power
off
I was hoping if I moved it he would like
oh no you okay you cannot hit him like
this you cannot just like take a wider
hips it's the power of my nudity I don't
know what you can do with the boat I
think it's just like a way to get around
faster if you employ this week a
strategy no um I wonder if we can Oh
into the boat if you put the thing on
fire yeah he runs off he runs off the
dock and then you can hit him with the
boat that makes sense
maybe the boat will explode if it's on
fire because of the the motorboat sure
so we have to free the boat position it
correctly but then again we still gotta
have enough shit left over to kill the
other guy right this is bullshit it's
might be a little bullshit
is he wearing clown makeup what Oh Jack
I still got him Oh is he crying like a
baby yeah he's like a baby I think
that's why they say we need to give him
the Tabor oh I get it
there's a book there huh there's no boat
there for our does he go a little bit
far enough help
okay
no later you don't want the Fleur gun
unless you just want to burn to death
with him I think I can throw the flare
it's not gonna go into the boat missed
the boat stop position right oh there's
a gas camera but I mean if we're trying
the boat trap they're not sit up and you
killed the girl
good oh I don't think that does anything
it does not
it surely does not
Oh not enough speed not enough speed so
what is that thing what can I do because
the Friday the 13th okay I don't know oh
is that what's his face is is that his
burnt skeleton like move there is that
what that's supposed to be oh maybe I
don't know
right the question is can I do this fast
enough not if he's coming I need I need
him over on this side you know
and hide switch to him
I don't think I have enough time yeah
yep yep no no I did huh
you did and I was gonna call up the door
and you're gonna be what are you doing
what do you need I'm fine so now wait
what is that
what does that jar of something up here
I need him to come from this side so I
can like time it right you know come on
you dickhead where are you where are you
the melee weapons work unless you're too
close
unless you're too close
Bell summons the killer immediately he
if he hasn't spawned yet okay oh oh you
just went inside that building
you see when he comes out wait for the
building
I need this lady as bait so you can put
it on the wrong side of oh my god oh
that's the dog what are you doing I
don't want it I don't want the killer to
go inside the building you know and so
I'm going to use the lady to chase him
over here then switch it to the man she
needs to be hidden before he did not
have that cover
son of a bitch rich and here's the thing
like I'm gonna do all this and it won't
matter because that second killer is
gonna come
I'm totally boned I've moved I've ruined
all my opportunities and makeup on
sorry oh I know I'm so boned we need to
get him into the wood chipper right I
want to go with this stuffed animal
theory we gonna find out how to get that
bear I gotta find out how to get that
bear down yeah oh don't worry that'll be
a highlight I think yeah look he's like
that guys all pinned up on the tree nope
damn it
I think the real objective here is to
get him into the yep no oh that's me
that's my fault
no no too early no no but uh else is too
late okay so you're gonna try to figure
out that teddy bear suit yeah and let's
find out the teddy bear situation what
why don't you jump in the water
schmuck schmuck I'm schmuck smacking
ttan smacking to you from the schmuck
Factory English much much much much much
much a ghulam oh look at that guy he's
hiding behind there that's funny I
wonder if he was always hiding best
foreshadowing yeah that's a great for
show that's the guy that popped up in
the foreground earlier right put the
underwear on the dog I don't all right
so we know what to get in this room we
don't know how to get the bear down we
don't know how to get the bear down
let's see if we can figure this out okay
what are the tools at our disposal we
know we have an axe and we have a hammer
like in in my thoughts is like the is
that the wood chipper would be an
insta-kill right I don't know if that
was that's true or not but anything if
the killer hits the rake that that's one
use rake for the killer Oh does she have
oh is that a little peepee is that a
sleepaway camp reference could be a
pee-pee see what it's sent a dude in I
mean we're on our way yeah that dude
likes a little I likes a little we we
honest at his Fifi no I'm saying I'm a
female
ah they kept me up the but good bit but
it's hard because like you know it's
hard to tell because the shadow of their
leg I don't know if that is a penis and
actually isn't that sleepaway camp to
where the killer is a boy not sleepaway
camp one if that was the same killer and
all I haven't really heard about them I
haven't really seen him I'm not a huge
horror movie right oh right my mother
was I remember seeing sleepaway camp too
far too young far far too young no Doug
you got the dog we already put doomed
world literally the first thing we ever
did in the game was get the four of them
in bed together that was just the very
first thing we did you late to the party
and that's on you
yep yep okay spoilers you know what I'm
gonna go ahead and not care about
spoilers for sleepaway camp and
sleepaway camp - you know that's well
past the moratorium for spoilers okay
good now you got the shells
I guess maybe if you just hammer the
wall in the bathroom maybe is that your
plan everybody's hiding behind tree yeah
yeah really
you have to like nice okay oh that it's
the bathroom was in here
reset the other one it's in there can
you hammer those things down I don't
think so no okay
drop the hammer drop the hammer this
place I could put him where he wants I
can
welcome to the river with it it might
Nina do you know yeah leave the hammer
in there well hope he searches
everywhere I think probably so he'll
probably still find the hammer sooner or
later I think him having a weapon is
irrelevant you can pick it yeah that's
right I had the hammer in my hand the
first time for what when I tried to walk
across okay I'm with you I'm with you
all right so the axe was way on the box
the axe is way on the dock the axes on
the time yeah I thought they you already
have the hammer no the other way other
doc oh so we got to get that door open
okay so yeah we you have to you have to
send someone to open up the thing nope
yep nothing too unusual just er
desiccated corpse I don't think that's
supposed to be a corpse I don't know
what that's supposed to be
I had to bullet now getting our ducks in
a row
yep hmm all right so we need two people
to get through you know what leftover
beefcake I don't I I don't believe there
are any spikes we have not run into any
spikes in this game yet we've run into a
knife and there are spike like things on
the rake nope nope don't drop it like
that drive like that
there yeah so that's sight you trip on
yeah so no matter what way it's facing
no no you know what
when I had it like that and the killer
came from the left he tripped left okay
so yeah like that
oh no that don't work you need to you
need to go off on the flat end yeah now
go left but that'll trip that that way
trips into the device yes you have it
placed correctly no now you don't have a
plane can you hide anyone who I mean
what I'm thinking about later is there a
hiding spot the rake does technically
have spikes but that's more of a rake no
you're gonna trip over it and it's not
face the right direction there you go
now you're good yeah yeah okay
yes it's a little bit of home alone
meets Friday the 13th I think that's
exactly what this game is is the two NES
classics home alone and Friday and 13
meshed into one beautiful game now don't
go into that last cabinet right that's
the yep that's the trigger canyon cabin
the trigger canyon what we've heard that
makes sense your dog is still alive
what's that spikes are gay code I knew
it I knew it I know that's false
what oh is that blood as that just
leaves it could be either way now go
into the water closet the water closet
which one is the water closet no go
right it has a WC on it oh okay what did
you use hammer I have a music thing oh
sure which may have been a mistake I
think now now I try hammering the walls
this is right okay
it's the only thing I can think of is
the chat now I'm open dude what happens
with the rake can you use the rake no
huh
we can only drop the rake rake doesn't
do anything if you exit no what do we do
chat what do we do how do we get that
fucking how do we get that bad here you
know what fuck the bear fuck it oh it
says use the potty use the potty in
there alright alright huh I think we've
done that before haven't we use the
other potty
no I guess we did oh my god oh that is
so dumb well so now if he gets the bear
what'll happen Jay
