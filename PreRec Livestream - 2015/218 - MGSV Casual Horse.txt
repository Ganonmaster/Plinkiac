Jack: But, anyway...
Rich: I...hate this thing, that would work...
Jack: Are you just gonna try to walk right past him like that? Is it gonna work?
Rich: We'll see. I could regret this.
Jack: Oh, get down! Get, what are you doing?
Rich: I went to hit X, to gallop...
Jack: Don't gallop! 
Rich: ...when he got off.
Jack: Just, hey. Casual, casual.
Rich: Just a casual horse. Casual horse! Casual horse! Don't mind me. 
Jack: I think they noticed you. Can you get on the other side now? Are they--
Rich: Casual horse! 
Jack: Wait, are they coming back for you?
Rich: Nope!
Jack: They're going away?! Fuck you, that worked...
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Just, just a casual horse going for a casual midnight stroll. Don't even worry about me, man!
Rich: How about that stealth?
Jack: Whoo! That AI, Rich.
Rich: Gotta love it. 
Jack: That AI is something special, right there.
