Rich: Oh, this is so difficult. It's so difficult. 
Jack: It's not difficult until it is.
Rich: I'm not convinced that's gonna happen, Jack.
Jack: Listen, I, I like, I like the experiment. This is the fun for me, is, I like seeing how far you can take this.
Rich: No, I don't wanna get Scary Face.
Jack: You don't even know what it does! 
Rich: Eh.
Jack: You can, you can, if you, if you press "Yes", you can look at what it does, and then choose not to.
Rich: I'm gonna mega punch Squirtle. That's what I'm gonna do.
Jack: Okay. I'm gonna mega...
Rich: I'm gonna mega punch Squirtle again.
Jack: I'm gonna mega punch Squirtle! You know what, Rich, I never thought I would hear you say that exact sentence. And that...
Rich: Oh, the, oh god, that water Pokemon! Oh, I'm so scared! I'm so scared! Oh, oh, I hit the wall! I hit the wall and I fucking knocked it down with my mega punch!
Jack: Squirtle did shit. That Squirtle did fucking shit.
Rich: Mega punch! Mega punch that cat thing! Oh, he's dead. Oh, he died, he died. Oh, this is so...the wall! Oh, the wall! Help me, the wall!
Jack: That can't...that cat thing.
Rich: Oh, no! It's a Ratta-tatta-tat! What will I do, Jack? What am I going to do with this woodland creature?
Jack: I don't know, Rich!
Rich: Maybe I'm going to burn him to death? Oh, he died in one hit! 
Jack: He's called Abra that Cat Thing. Oh, fucking hell, Rich.
Rich: Fuck off, Burger. Come back when you grow a pair.
