[Mike is reading the back of a copy of Scariest Places on Earth] (?)
Mike: “The Brumder Mansion.” [Looks up] Why, that’s in Milwaukee! [Goes back to reading]
[A door opens, Rich walks in]
Rich: Hi, Mike
M: Oh hi, Rich Evans! [Sets the tape down] Why, it looks like we’re both wearing the same Halloween costume this year! Horrible white trash that can’t dress themselves [Rich grins without humor] And you even smell like a dumpster! Way to go fully with the costume--
R: [Robotically] Ha ha ha ha ha! What are we doing today, Mike?
M: Well, this year we’re gonna downplay the Halloween element a little, we’re still gonna watch some scary movies, but we’re not getting in costume, we’re not uh, gonna--gonna try to scare each other or anything, you remember what happened last year?
R: I certainly--[Raises his left hand, quickly puts it down]--do! [Raises his right hand with the index finger bent]
***
[Flashback to Best of the Worst episode 11, when Rich was cutting the losing tape with a saw]
M: So, Rich! What is it like to spend your birthday cutting into a VHS tape with a saw?
R: Well, it’s kinda like--OH! [Screams] [Camera shakes] OH GOD! OH GOD! OH! OH GOD! OH GOD! OH SHIT!
M: This was a bad idea!
[The camera is set down on a slant, blood is all over the table and tape, Jessi runs and puts paper towels over Rich’s hand]
R: OH G--[Everybody disappears, an ominous sound builds up, the Showbiz Pizza Bear appears behind the table]
***
M: Nothing wild like that’s gonna happen this year, nothing scary, nothing haunted, anything like that, so, uh, Rich, what movies are we gonna watch today?
R: Well, because it’s Halloween, I was thinking we could watch some comedies, so our first movie was going to be--[Removes the tape from the shelf]--Cool Dog 
M: Hmm-kay, can I see it? [Rich tries removing fake cobwebs from the tape, other tapes fall to the ground] (?) that?
R: Yeah. Let me get Cool Dog for you [Removes the cobwebs]
M: I’m sure Cool Dog is very scary, on a technical level. But, um, we need a horror film
R: Let’s watch these movies, then, that are sitting right here on this shelf!
M: Alright, well, ok [Grabs the tape]
R: The first movie up is called The Item
*Movie #1 The Item*
M: Well, I’m gonna start reading the quotes on the back first
R: Ok
M: Uh, “fantastically fun! Raw, savvy...uber cool film…” Ain’t It Cool News. Uh, it is not--uh, the quote is not attributed to Harry Knowles [Screenshot of a Kickstarter page/campaign, titled “Future Filmgeekdom: Ain’t It Cool with Harry Knowles” appears] Do you remember his Kickstarter? Three years ago? That he did nothing?...To complete?
R: Yeah

[2:31] M: Our second quote, uh, “a blood-drenched Taran-tino…” [Rich makes a face] Like--oh! Like Tarantino
R: Yeah
M: I thought that might’ve been someone from Toronto, like someone who made a film--
R: Torontino?
M: “Tarantino-type caper…..crossed with Alien.” Ok!
[Alien: Isolation Nostromo Edition Xbox One cover appears, Rich sighs]

[3:44] M: “A Sundance groundbreaker”
R: [Scrunches up his face] What?
M: I don’t think this even played at Sundance. Maybe someone broke it on the ground outside of Sundance. Uh...the--and this is, uh, Box Office Magazine Movie and Film Reviews

[4:13] M: I wanna punch this movie

[4:17] M: I’m going to read the back of the box now. “Four felons are contacted by an anonymous client via the internet.”
R: That sounds horribly unexciting
M: Are you following along?
R: Yes
M: “Their instructions: go to a remote location, pick up a sealed box, and keep it safe for 24 hours. The reward: over a million dollars!” Why did they need felons to do this?
R: Makes sense (?) Because they’re very reliable and trustworthy
M: “Seems simple enough. However, upon getting it back to their apartment,” oh no….[Rich laughs] So--so, college kids made this. In their apartment that, no doubt, has, um, movie posters all over the wall and pizza boxes and beer cans everywhere. “Their curiosity gets the better of them and they decide to investigate their package” [More laughter from Rich]
M: I don’t get what’s so funny about that [Looks between Rich and the camera]
R: [Has turned red from laughing] Go on
M: Uhh, I forgot where I was,  “their curiosity gets the better of them and they decide to investigate the package” [Rich begins laughing again] [Whispers] Why does he keep on laughing so much? [After several more seconds] “When they investigate their package, they discover that they have unleashed a deadly creature….from their package”
R: Eh, you’re just throwing those packages in there, now
M: “And none of them are getting out alive”
R: From their package? [Starts laughing]

[6:33] M: What’s up next, Rich?
R: Well, our next film is called The Crawlers! [Silence]
*Movie #2 The Crawlers*
M: Uhhh, yeah, there’s a lady, a scantily clad lady with...something on her, is that--are those like, snakes, or…
R: [Nearly drops the tape while flipping it over] Ok, the back of the box says: “The Crawlers! A new kind of monster...A living, lethal organism that strikes its victims without moving” [A small red arrow points to the last word, which is “warning”] “No one can stop the crawlers!”
M: But don’t they crawl? [Rich looks at the back of the box] How do they stop (?) their victims without moving if they crawl?
R: “Warning”
M: Is this a movie about dangerous babies?
R: They--they--I--I--I read that wrong
M: Disgusting babies? (?)
R: I read that wrong, it’s “a lethal organism that strikes its victims without warning.” I don’t know how I read that as “moving”
M: “Crawling” looks very similar to “warning”
R: Yeah… [Mike looks at the camera] (?)

[7:45] Girl #1: You from around here?
Girl #2: Yeah
M: Why would you ask someone on a bus if they’re from around here?
JH: Are you from (?)
M: Doesn’t make any sense
JH: Do you--do you live on a bus?
Jessi: Are you from bus? (?)
M: It’s sort of in the middle from being anywhere
J: Yeah
[Silence]
R: Maybe they just got on the bus together recently
M: Rich! I made my point! Don’t counter it, please! 

[8:06] [In the VHS room]
R: That’s it, that’s all it says...I’m actually done reading the back of the box--
M: Oh, really?
R: It was two sentences
M: Oh my gosh, well !--
R: There’s some pictures, there’s some people playing around with a--a--a...rubber monster tentacle?
M: [Gets closer to look at the pictures] Okay…
R: And then there’s a woman carrying what looks like a...it looks like a cow udder inside of a backpack?
M: Who--alright…
R: It looks like, to me... 
M: You got me--you got me interested so far….
(...)
[9:08] R: And yeah, that’s the movie
M: And who’s the director--
R: Take it or leave it
M: --of this film
R: Uhh Martin Newlin [Mike looks at the camera] And I’m told that this film has the alternate title….of Troll 3
M: That’s very interesting, but it’s not the same people that made Troll 2. Troll 2 is a sequel to Troll 1, and has nothing to do with Troll 1 either (?)
R: No, seems--(?) just call it like, you know...Alien 4
J: Or The Crawlers
R: Or The Crawlers [Camera pans around to show Jay holding up the other camera] This is--this is Predators 4?
M: Is--is calling your movie Troll something the--the title equivalent of, uh, Alan Smithee? [Rich giggles] You know, just--
R: Yeah
M: “We’ll call it Troll something and we’ll make some money back”
(...)
[10:31] M: Well, we had to come crawling back to the movies after watching The Crawlers. It was so exhausting
R: [Robotically]  Ha ha ha ha! [Mike reaches for a tape] Let’s watch one of these 8 movies on this 8 movie pack
M: Well, we have 8 movies. One of them is bound to be alright
R: We’re watching Blood Lock
*Movie #3 Blood Lock*
M: Our next film, Rich, our third film of the evening is called Blood Lock.Uh...and, as you can see, it’s a very tiny picture of it. Um...we’ve randomly picked this one, off this 8...
R: Completely randomly, yes
M: And uh, there’s a man, who is trying to have a--a bowel movement. Who also is a vampire
R: And a lock, he has a lock (?)
(...)
[12:28] M: “When Barry and Christine move into a new house, they discover a strange locked door in the basement. A door that hides a secret, a terrible secret.” What’s inside the locked door in the basement, Rich? What do you think?
R: Uhh, a--a--another blood lock? That they can put at a different door in the house?
M: Is the m--actual movie inside the door? Like they open it up and they go, “oh no, that’s what we made?”
R: That’d be--that’d be kind of interesting, though, so, probably not
(...)
M: Do you think it’s just, like, a vampire?
R: Uhh--
M: (?) They locked a vampire…
R: Do we know for sure it’s a vampire?
M: Well, there--there’s what appears to be a vampire pooping on the cover of the box
R: That looks like a Satan to me, are you sure it’s not like a Satan in the door? [Leaves before Mike responds]
M: Alright, let’s go watch Blood Lock

[14:03] [In the screening room]
M: Well that was Blood Lock
JH: Sure was
J: Alright, let’s go talk about these movies
[The lights turn off as everybody gets up to leave, Mike lights a candle]
(?): Oh no. I think...
JK: The power went out. Where are we gonna talk about these movies?
M: I know where we can talk about these movies….in a haunted mansion! [Rich gasps in horror]

[15:07] J: [Lifts up an orange bottle of wine] Would anyone like some Hallowine?
JH: No
JS: No
[Jay looks at the bottle, cuts to later]
M: Well, let’s talk about our first film. Our first film was called The Item. “Something is dying to get out…” uhh--
J: That was us out of the room

[15:31] JH: Well, in The Item, there is a group of, uh, hapless, uh, crooks? [Stammers] There’s gonna be a lot of question marks at the end of sentences when I describe this movie

[16:45] Most Annoying Crook: [After killing somebody] I’ve gotta pee
JH: And then they go back to the hideout, which is the most annoying crook’s girlfriend’s place? It is full of terrible art. And--
J: Better get used to this location
JH: That’s true, that’s where most of the movie happens. Except for outside
Guy: [To the most annoying crook] Fuck you hard! [The crook glides forward, whooshing noise plays] (?) 
[In the screening room]
[Jack guffaws]
J: Stop!
JH: Damn you! Fuck-- 
JK: Yaaay!
[In the discussion room] 
JH: Actually, we put “outside” in quotes
J: Pfffft!
JS: Yeah
JH: Outside of the--
M: It’s like a alley set…
JH: Yeah
J: Yeah
M: It’s like The Room scene when he throws the football
J: [Laughs] And then falls over for no reason?
M: It’s more, uh…
JH: Mhm-mhm
M: It’s--it’s less realistic...than the Tommy Wiseau location
JH: [To Jay] Can you put that back up there, I don’t wanna hold this anymore
[Jay takes the tape, he drops it] (?)
JS: Oh no, that’s fine
JH: Yeah

[19:03] R: Oh, FUCK YOU!!!

[19:57] JK: He just went to 110% cool!
J: Ugh I hate this fucking guy so much

[22:19] JH: But he--that’s the thing, though, if--if--if it had been like a psychological thing where there’s like a slug with telepathic, you know, abilities, nobody would’ve fucked a puppet. [Jay laughs] And that’s... that’s all we got out of this movie, ‘cause it was all bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, that lady’s fucking a puppet, the end

[23:30] [The main crook gets shot and dies]
JH: Oh
J: He died, finally!
JH: Finally
JK: Yaaaay! [Rich, Jay, and Jack clap]
[In the discussion room]
M: And speaking of The Item, and the cover…
J: Oh, yeah
M: Can we sue Artisan for releasing that cover?
JH: No
M: I mean howww...misleading
JS: Oh yeah
M: It’s like a reptilian eye
JS: Yeah, and that’s not like that--
J: And that’s a classic case of we--we’re selling the box, not the movie
JS: Yeah
JH: If we could sue Artisan we would be suing Cannon films over and over and over again
JS: Oh, of course

[23:57] JS: You know what? You know what, I’m gonna go out on a limb here and say The Amazing Bulk was a better, uh...made movie
M: No
Jay and Josh: Noooo

[24:05] J: I’ll--I’ll say, ninety...five percent of this movie made me angry. Like more angry than any movie we’ve watched on Best of the Worst
(...)
J: But! I’m gonna say, those last five minutes did a lot to redeem it. That was some weird, perverted Frank Hadden Lauder (?) shit, when the girl started fucking the puppet [Silence] That was--that was genuinely entertaining [Nobody speaks]

[25:33] M: Onto our next film, The Crawlers, uh, a.k.a Troll….3? A.k.a….
J: Creepers
M: Creepers, a.k.a…..
J: Contamination .7
M: Yes
JS: Wow! Good job
J: Thank you
M: So, i--
J: This is the second movie, the same year, by the same director to be called Troll 3
JH: [Laughs] I didn’t realize it was the same year 
J: Yep [Josh laughs louder] Same year, same director. 
JH: Damn it! 
J: Neither of them have anything to do with trolls

[27:46] R: [Mocking the actor in the movie] [In a boring, flat tone] “We’re gonna find it!....I used to play high school football, before I hurt my knee. Now I’m acting”

[28:48] M: Trees don’t come alive--[A picture of a tree from The Wizard of Oz slams down onto the center of the screen, WRONG!!! Is written in front of it]

[33:06] [Sad Grandpa’s loading a musket, everybody’s laughing/screaming]
R: Ohhhh god
JH: Oh no, please, Oh god, please
JK: Is he gonna shoot himself with a musket?
M: It’s his gun from when he served in the Civil War

[34:43] JH: They make the most im--like--like--[Stutters]--the promiscuous lady makes the most, like, difference on the plot
J: Hmm-mhm
JS: Yeah
JH: Of anybody in this movie [Camera quickly pans to the right]
J: Yeah
R: [In the background] Oh my god, did you see that?
JH: What?
R: The camera just moved
[Silence, everybody just stares at Rich]
J: Which o--your camera?
R: Yeah, it just moved
JS: Shut the fuck up [Cuts to them continuing the discussion]

[35:58] J: Well it’s clear that the filmmakers don’t know anything about...uh, toxic waste or the effects of it, because the end of the movie is the entire town--
M: That was the 1980s
J: The entire town, they’re coming together and they’re gonna take care of these Toxic Barrel Wastes--[The words appear on screen, followed by a bottle of Hallowine, dinging noise plays]--by just touching them with their bare hands and--
Jay and Josh: Rolling them around
M: They’re clearly leaking in the first place, or there wouldn’t be a vine problem

[36:27] J: Well, first what happens is the--they show up with the helicopter, they find all of them, and then a vine reaches up, pulls down the helicopter, then it turns in--it magically turns into a toy helicopter and then blows up
JH: [Nods] Hmm-hmm
[A vine pulls down a helicopter and blows up]
[Everyone exclaims, Rich and Jack clap]
M: It just explodes
J: One second a toy helicopter (?)
JH: Yeah….
JK: We need a freeze-frame on that toy helicopter [Picture of the toy appears]
J: That was adorable
JK: Beautiful

[38:20] M: Well, speaking of Blood Lock...um, our third film of the evening is--is called Blood Lock
J: Blood Lock
M: A William Victor Schotten-freude film [Josh and Jay laugh]
JH: How did you not come up with that yesterday?
M: I don’t know, I just saw it

[40:29] JS: She wants to be, and I’m quoting the movie, “mortal”
Woman: Look at me [Guy looks] I’ll grant you mortality
JK: Uh, mortality?
JH: I have mortality
[Mike starts snickering, then Jay laughs]

[42:39] M: The Amish are known for fighting vampires. The Amish are known for warding off vampires, this is well known, this is a well-known fact
JH: Are you making that up right now?
JS: Oh, they don’t like the sun and the Amish don’t use electricity [Gasps]
M: That makes no sense

[43:06] M: They had (?) made video cameras. That were made out of wood and corn stalks, and that’s why the picture looked so bad

[46:06] JH: Secondly, what kind of--[Slowly zooms in on Jay]-- hack filmmakers throw in a fuckin’ “it was all a dream” at the end, like what a bullshit move!
JS: Oh, I totally agree!
JH: [Leans forward] [Directed at Mike] What a bullshit move!
M: Clearly, complete hacks make their film end--
J: Absolutely
M: With it was all a dream, which is what--
J: Which is the worst way you could end a movie
M: Which is what Blood Lock did
J: Yeah
M: Um
JH: Actually, no, it’s the--as Jack a--accurately pointed out, it’s the second worst way you could end a movie. The worst way is to cut to black and hear a gunshot
M: That’s right
[Plays the last scene of The Item]
M: I knew it, the gunshot--
J: ….the gunshot over black (?) Yeeeess! [Josh and Jay laugh, Jack claps] It does not get more film student than that

[46:54] M: Well, Blood Lock, it seems to be in, in, uh, in the running for Best of the Worst here. Uh, which is just sickening

[47:10] [A woman sets down a box that says “fragiles” on it near the edge of a table, she bumps into it and it falls]
JS: Ohhhh you dummy!
JK: You cunt!
[In the discussion room]
M: But I guess it’s the time of the night, when we talk about which film is the best of the worst, and for our Halloween selection...this is just shit
J: This is pitiful
JS: This is pathetic
M: It’s pathetic, yeah
JH: I didn’t even wanna think about it...again…
J: I kinda forgot that Halloween existed
M: We gotta go with best of the worst, I’m going with best of the worst, what was the most entertaining for me? [Sucks air through teeth] Oh, god, I don’t know, can I--can I pass this off? Can I--
JS: Sure, would you like me to go?
M: Yeah, please go, I--I need some more time to think about it
JH: Do you want us--m--maybe we can, we can discuss and maybe that’ll…
JS: Yeah
M: Come back to it
J: Would you like to call a friend?
M: I would like to phone a friend
JS: You wanna phone *me*?
M: W--well--
JS: Here, call me
M: No, you’re in the discussion, I gotta phone--
JS: Oh
M: --somebody else
JH: Call Rich [Points]
JS: Okay
M: [Takes out his phone] [To Jessi] You go
JS: Okay
JH: Call Rich
JS: Sooo….[Mike taps his phone’s screen] [Rich Evans Personal Cell Phone Number: (414) 475-8192 appears on screen] [Jessi continues the discussion, explaining her pick]
JS: Um, Blood Lock is my pick, though, for best of the worst, um, it’s--I--I find it to be the most entertaining and the most, like, “what?”
Woman’s Voice: I’m sorry, but the person you called has a voice mailbox that has not been set up yet
JS: Ohhh
JH: Rich!
J: It hasn’t been set up yet?
JH: You didn’t set up your--[Silence] [Mike puts his phone away] Nobody leaves you messages?
JS: Wooow

[53:28] M: The winner is…a tie
J: The winner is anyone that hasn’t seen any of these movies
JH: Yep
JS: Ohh
M: Definitely the loser is The Item, and that--that definitely is getting destroyed
JS:.....Somehow
M: Be kind, don’t rewind
[Pause]
R: Meh

[53:47] [Jay and Rich are in the warehouse]
J: Well, Rich, since The Item is a pretentious art film about a monster in a box, what do you think is the most appropriate way to destroy it?
R: Let’s burn it on a grill!
J: [Reluctantly] Okay! Now this tape does have something I’ve never ever seen before [Sets the tape down, removes it from the box, points to a yellow sticker on the tape] Which is a movie melt heat sensor. So we’re going to--to pay close attention to that as it cooks on the grill
R: Yeah
J: Uh, “warning: if dot turns black and heat damage or label tampering is evident, customer must purchase video”
R: So I’m assuming this is from a video store in Phoenix, Arizona?
J: It--yeah, that must be the case--
R: Yeah
J: Or it gets hot and they’re worried--
R: Leave it in the car and it melts in the car
J: I guess, yeah, but--
R: Okay
J: If--if that is the case, if that does turn black, you’re paying for it, Rich 
[Rich turns to the camera with a shocked expression]
[Cuts to a grill]
J: Well, Rich, we got the grill going [Jay has a beer and a spatula in his hands, Rich is holding a plate with patties on it] Uh, how do you feel about cooking some burgers?
R: I’m Rich Evans, of course I wanna cook some burgers
J: Well, alright!
R: Alright [Jay puts the burgers on the grill] And now the pièce de résistance [Puts The Item on the plate]
J: I don’t know what that means but let’s put The Item on the grill!
R: I think it means piece of shit [Jay removes the cover and places the tape on the grill, Rich rubs his hands together]
[After flipping the burgers]
J: Now, the movie melt heat sensor is not activating, but it’s very clearly melting. Should we see if the sensor goes off when it’s facing the grill more?
R: Sure, sure [Jay flips the tape, the bottom half is sticking to the grill; when he flips it over the sensor has turned black]
J: I think it’s confirmed now that the tape IS melting!
R: Sweet!
J: The sticker has told us so
M: [In the background] The movie melt sensor works!
R: After the movie has already melted!
J: [Laughs] Hey Rich, uh, well, to celebrate why don’t we eat these burgers, can you go get the cheese?
R: Oh, yeah
J: I’m gonna flip the tape over. Oh, it touched the burger a little bit, but I’m sure it’ll be fine
