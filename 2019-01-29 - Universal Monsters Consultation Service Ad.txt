Well, that's, speaking of budget, that's the weirdest thing to me, is that they decided to make...
I mean, I guess it makes sense if you're looking at it, like, worldwide box office in foreign countries, you want to make something that has that sort of fun Avengers-type tone.
But you look at, like, the original Universal monster movies: they're horror movies.
Do something, like, like, follow the Blumhouse model and make these very very modestly budget, budgeted actual horror movies.
