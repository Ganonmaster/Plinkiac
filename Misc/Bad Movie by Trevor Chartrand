Trevor: Explain to me what The Room is, as if I've never heard of it before.
Man: The Room is a bad movie that wasn't trying to be a bad movie, but it worked out really well.
Woman: I guess it's about, well, it's just chaos, the whole movie, kind of.
Woman: It's very hard to describe.
Man: The Room is, allegedly, the worst movie ever made.
Trevor: I have to admit, I'm a little, like, worried about what we say when we cross the border.
Joel: Why?
Trevor: Film students, making a documentary.
Joel: Son, what are you, what are you doing here in, what's, what's your business in the states? It's, like, well, we're making a documentary.
Trevor: Okay.
Joel: We're film students.
Trevor: That goofy-looking guy behind the wheel, that's me. And my obsession with bad movies has taken me from Toronto all the way to Milwaukee to meet with some fellow fans. Yes, that's right. I said bad movies. Now, why would someone want to watch something that's terrible? Like, on purpose. Well, that's what I'm here, hoping to find out. We just have to call Jay, and let him know that we are here. Hi, Jay. Hey, this is Trevor. Um, we've, uh, we've been talking through emails for the last two months. Uh, we're here at the studio. Here we go. Hey.
Jay: Hello.
Trevor: Good to meet you, man.
Jay: Nice to meet you.
Trevor: I'm Trevor.
Jay: Trevor.
Trevor: This is Joel. He's the camera for me.
Jay: Hi.
Joel: Nice to meet you.
Trevor: And James will be doing sound.
James: Hello.
Trevor: So this is your collection?
Jay: This is our, yeah, we do, we do bad movie nights here at the studio, since we have the space now, and we have a giant screen, so, we have friends over and drink beer and watch movies, and, yeah, we just keep accumulating more and more. We try and find weird VHS tapes at thrift stores. Uh, like, The Donut All-Stars.
Trevor: What?
Jay: This is a quality one. It's about a child molestor, and a talking asshole.
Mike: Yeah, the concept of the video is that, the, yeah, the hole is, like, it's supposed to be, like, the love of Jesus. And, and, if, if, if, if you're missing it, you have to fill that hole up with something. But it, it looks like a talking asshole. It's, it's just kind of creepy. So, there's four types of bad movies. I think there might be four types of bad movies.
Jay: Oh, really? What are these types?
Mike: Oh, let me share those with you now. There's bad-bad.
Trevor: Okay.
Mike: Which is, which is painfully bad to watch, right? It's so bad, you, you can't barely watch it, and you wanna turn it off. Good-bad, also known as funny-bad, meaning it's, it's a failure at whatever it was trying to do. It's, it was trying to be a drama, and it was, you know, it ends up being horribly funny. There is technically-bad, which is a movie that's, that's, you can also get entertainment value from it from it, for it being so bad. But, there are so many technical problems with it, you actually learn stuff from it, like bad filmmaking techniques, and all that stuff. And then, the final category is someone that makes a bad movie on purpose to be funny-bad
Jay: Yeah.
Mike: And, and it ends up being nothing.
Jay: Well, for me, a lot of it comes from low-budget movies. And, uh, cuz I know, growing up, like, I probably learned more about filmmaking from bad movies, from low-budget b-movies than, you know, Jurassic Park or Batman, or bigger movies like that, cuz it's, like, the seams are showing and, and you've, it almost gets you more involved with the creative process, where you're watching it, and you're just, like, I can see the wire there.
Mike: Mm-hmm.
Jay: Or, you know, the boom's in shot, so that's where the mic is coming from. I probably learned more about filmmaking that way than, than anything else.
