[Intro - Mike is asleep at his computer desk, apparently having a bad dream]

Mike: No...no.....no-o-o-o!!!

[Mike wakes up]

Mike: Oh. I had a horrible nightmare that the entire Star Wars saga ended with Lord Vader awkwardly stumbling out of a contraption, and yelling, "Noooo!!" 

[Mike pauses]

Mike: Oh, wait. That really happened.

[Onscreen Text: RED LETTER MEDIA AND BLANC SCREEN CINEMA PRESENT]

[Cut to Mike, standing in an apartment complex hallway, holding a microphone]

Mike: In the history of humanity, oftentimes a single word has meant so much: Revolution. Honor. Welfare.

[Onscreen Text: A FILM BY MIKE STOKLASA AND JAY BAUMAN]

Mike: But oftentimes, a single word may have powerful meanings: Love. Hate. And, of course...

[James Earl Jones' signature "Noooo!" scream from the prequels plays over the title card]

[Cut to Mike, holding a cellphone in someone's apartment. "Star Wars" licensed music plays prominently over the dialogue]

Mike: Karin Franklin...? Wh-, where's Rich Evans? Where, where'd he go? Well, can you have him call me on my cellular phone when he has the chance? I have the greatest news. I'm sorry, I can't hear you, what? We're making a documentary film on "Noooo!!!" Yes. All right, thanks Karin. Bye. 

[Mike loses his balance and stumbles to the floor]

[Cut to Mike in the hallway]

Mike: The film is of "Star Wars", "The Empire Strikes Back", and "Return of the Jedi". Defined a generation. DEFINED. Well, now they defy a generation. Little did...

[Mike stumbles backwards into a corner wall]

[Cut to apartment]

Mike: The culmination of the entire idea of "Star Wars" was the transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader.

[Cut to Mike out on the sidewalk, interviewing passerbys]

Mike: Have you seen "Star Wars: Episode III"?

Lady: No, I haven't.

Mike: ..."nooo", you haven't?

[Cut to Mike in apartment]

Mike: In his first moments of life as the newly-created Sith Lord, Darth Vader, uh, he falls out of a comical contraption--

[Cut to Mike talking to someone on the street]

Mike: --and lumbers like a Frankenstein, and then says, "Noooo!!!"

[Cut to Mike in apartment]

Mike: Millions of people across the country, and possibly the world -- maybe even the galaxy -- um, began vomiting instantaneously. Not from nausea. But from jocular reaction. The muscles contracting so fast from the laughter. Uh, no one found that funny.

[Cut to Mike on the street. A college-aged man and woman are making exaggerated gestures with their bodies]

Man: "Is Padme okay? Is she all right?"

Woman: "You killed her!"

Man: "Noooooooooo!!!!!"

[Cut to Mike in apartment. He's talking on a cell phone]

Mike: Do you have any desire to see "Star Wars: Episode III"?

[A staticky voice comes through on the other end, presumably Rich Evans. The voice says, "Noooooooooo!!!"]

Mike: That's wonderful.

[Cut to Mike, sans cell phone]

Mike: In this film, we will explore the deeper meaning of "Noooooo!!" and ask people how they felt about "Nooooooo!!!"

[Cut to Mike, sitting at his computer desk. An audio program plays "Nooooo!!!" seemingly to Mike's delight]

Mike: It's time to end the madness. Vote "No" on "Yes", and vote "Yes" on "Nooooooooooo!!!!!" When George Lucas runs for public office, I'm voting "Nooooooooo!!!"

[YTMND of "Nooooooo!!!" plays, alongside images of Darth Vader photoshopped onto bags of "Nooo Mix" cat food (formerly Meow Mix).

Mike: Accompany us on this adventure while we explore and dissect that scene in the film that ruined everything. Not just "Star Wars" move, but every other type of movie ever made.

[Cut to Mike leaving the apartment complex]

Mike: And here we go.

[YTMND of "Noooooo!!!" plays, this time over the CNN logo]

[Cut to Mike, sitting down in the apartment]

Mike: Now when I first saw "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" in the theater with some friends of mine, um, one friend in particular began laughing hysterically.

[Cut to Rich Evans, sitting in a green recliner]

Rich Evans: I burst out into uncontrollable laughter, and I couldn't stop laughing. I was actually trying to stop laughing.

[Cut to Mike]

Mike: And he continued to muffle his consistent giggling throughout the rest of the film. We didn't even remember what happened. We were all... [Mike mimics covering his mouth with his hand] Obviously, it had a profound effect on all of us.

[Cut to Rich Evans]

Rich Evans: Why would George Lucas do that? The, the serious Darth Vader, the, the, the aura, the presence you need to keep, to keep that character working that, he thrives on that dark, tall...you can't have Darth Vader doing silly things. And we knew going in that he couldn't say the word "Padme", and have it sound good. And then he said that. That was the first thing out of his mouth.

[Cut to Mike]

Mike [with an echo-y voice]: "Where is Padme?"

[Cut to Rich Evans]

Rich Evans: And then he, he starts ripping out of the chair. Certainly him ripping out of the chair was, was hysterical in itself.

Mike [off-screen]: Do you enjoy watching other people fail?

Rich Evans [giggling]: Who doesn't?

[Cut to Mike]

Mike: We ruined the experience for everyone in the theater, but no one else started laughing along, so we thought that maybe we're the only people that find "Noooo!!!" funny. And then something started circulating on the internet. I, I began to realize that there are an entire, uh, there's a whole, everyone thinks that's funny.

[Cut to Mike enjoying another YTMND of "Nooo!!", where the audio transitions seamlessly into the main chorus of RHCP's "Love Rollercoaster", and then back to "Noooo!!"]

Mike: We discovered a multitude of different "Noooo!!" things on the internet. We'd like to share some of those with you, um, so here we go.

[Cut to Mike in front of his computer]

Mike: Ready, Johnny? 

[Mike pauses awkwardly]

Mike: This is the site. Uh, I don't know what it is, but it's called YTMND.com. And usually the gimmick is that there'll be a little cut-out Vader head pasted on, on somewhere in the picture.

[A "Reading Rainbow" YTMND plays, with Vader's helmet photoshopped over a small child, and Vader's "Noooo!!!" synced with "rainbow"]

Mike: Uh, here's a little Monty Python. 

[The knights who say "Ni", instead, say, "Nooooo!!!"]

[Mike cocks his head and stares briefly at the camera]

Mike: Oftentimes it'll be animated slightly.

[Various YTMND's play]

Mike: All right, well, we can't go through all of them, but just to let you know, um, this is one page, and there are a 136,000 pages.

[Wheel of Fortune-themed YTMND plays]

[Cut to Mike standing in the apartment complex hallway]

Mike: All right. We're leaving the confines of Apt. #8, heading out into the streets of Milwaukee to talk to the average citizens on "Noooo!!!" and how they feel about "Noooo!!!" Uh, it should be an interesting experience. Let's go.

[Mike turns around, and immediately slams headfirst into a load-bearing wall]

[Cut to Mike on the street with a microphone]

Mike: All right, here comes some nice young ladies here. 

[Woman #1 puts her hand up without looking and says, "Sorry."]

Mike: Real quick question. Real quick question. Have you seen the third Star Wars film? Episo-, "Revenge of the Sith" film?

[The women ignore Mike's questions]

Mike: Mother&*#@$!

[Mike approaches a speeding car]

Mike: Sir! Oh, that person was in a car.

[Mike walks down the sidewalk]

Mike: I'm not too good at this sort of thing.

[Mike interviews a woman who is laying down on the grass]

Mike: What do you think about "Noooo!!!"?

Woman: About what?

Mike: "Noooo!!!"

Woman [laughing]: What's "Noooo!!!"? What does that mean?

[Mike comically shakes his fists in the air]

Mike: "Noooo!!!"

[Mike interviews a college-aged man]

Mike: Was there a part in the movie that stood out to you as particularly funny?

Man: I believe it was when Darth Vader did the "Noooo!!!" That kinda just ruined the whole transition to Darth Vader for me.

[Mike nods in agreement]

Mike: God bless you, sir.

[Cut back to woman on lawn]

Woman: Cheap air is good. Really, my favorite, uh, movie is "Harold and Maude".

Mike: What, what the hell is that?

Woman: You never seen "Harold and Maude"?!

[Mike looks at the camera and shakes his head]

Woman: Oh, my god.

[She points at a man and woman walking by]

Woman: Have you ever seen "Harold and Maude"?

Man walking by: Yeah.

Mike: Well, who's in "Harold and Maude"?

Woman: Um, that old lady that used to be with the Clint Eastwood thing...

Mike: Bea Arthur?

Woman: No, no, no no...

Mike: Clint Eastwood?

Woman: Do you want me to get up and hit you?

Mike: Absolutely not.

[Mike almost walks into a small tree limb]

Mike: Wait, that's bad.

[Mike is interviewing a man on a porch]

Mike: Action!

Man: "Where is Padme? Is she safe?"

Mike: "No. You killed her."

Man [unenthusiastically]: "Nooooooo!!!!!"

[Mike is walking down the block]

Mike: Is there a better way we can do this? Maybe say, like, we work for, uh, Ed Asner? He's dying soon, and wants to, to give you his money, but you have to answer this trivia question.

[Speed up shot of Mike walking to patio tables of a nearby Italian restaurant. A man and woman are having dinner]

Mike: Have you seen the new Star Wars film?

Man: No.

Mike: Why not?

Man: I, I, the whole Star Wars thing is so stupid.

Woman: No, I disagree. I think it's not stupid. I think it's very smart.

[Low-angle shot of Mike as he hears their response. Horror music starts to slightly build up as the man and woman begin to disagree]

Man: That's the science ficiton-type person, personality...

[Crosstalk]

Woman: I think, in general, people who are into science fiction are, um, very progressive thinkers. 

[The man scoffs]

Woman: But I think Gene, Gene Rodenbury did, and what other people do, is they take human nature, and they frame it in a way that's outside of the way we normally think about it...

[The man scoffs again]

Woman: ...and the reason I love it so much, and I'm being serious, is that it takes the anthropological aspects of, of human nature--

[The man has a shit-eating grin, and points at the woman as she finishes her argument]

Woman: --and it, it puts it in a different framework, so it can see...the absurdities, and, and the strengths that humans have.

Man: I hated all the Star Wars movies. Every time I hear that "dunnn!" in the beginning--

Woman: You know, in order to hate something...

Man: --I think, "Oh, god, here it goes."

Woman: ...you have to have some sort of, I mean, the opposite of love is indifference, and hate is not the opposite of love. It's fear.

[Cut to Mike, far away from the man and woman at the Italian restaurant]

Mike: Yeah, uh, I, we might be asking the wrong people.

[Mike interviews an older lady who is going out for a walk]

Lady: I, I speak a little English. I speak Russian. I'm from Moscow. Yes.

Mike: Wow. Do you like Star Wars?

Lady: Yes.

[Mike mimics Darth Vader emerging from his comical contraption]

Mike: "Noooo!!" Do you remember that part?

Lady: Yes.

Mike: That was--

Lady: I am glad to see you, I am glad to meet you.

Mike: Glad to meet you, too.

Lady: Yeah. Yes. Goodbye!

Mike: Goodbye.

[YTMND plays]

[Mike is typing at his computer]

Mike: "Supershadows.com: The Complete Revenge of the Sith Script as Written by George Lucas". What we're trying to find is exactly how many o's come after the "N" in "Noooo!!!!" at the end of the film. 

[Mike talks into the microphone]

Mike: How many "Noooo!!" o o's and exclamation points follow the end. 

[Mike is back at his computer]

Mike: So, here we are. Uh, "EXTERIOR SPACE", uh, is the beginning of the story. "A long time ago, in a galaxy fat, fat away....." Actually, "fat, fat away", isn't that the Kirstie Alley, uh, show? "War! The Republic", uh, whatever. [sic] "Upta". Oh, there's a character named [mumbling]. Uh, Obi-Wan rides on a giant lizard...uh, I'm bored. 

[Mike belches]

Mike: If only I can scroll down to when the actual movie occurs. When Padame, and Ana-, and Obi-Wan start yammering on about nonsense, and you click on the little, the little scroller bar, cuz we all know the part we're looking forward to, it's what this film is being made about. Cuz there's no other way to get to the bottom of the screen, other than scrolling through it. Oh, Jar-Jar has appeared into the film. We all know about Jar Jar. 

[Mike stares at the camera]

Mike: Jar Jar's first line is "Hello, Annie." And there's an additional "o" at the end of "hello". If that hello is one "o", I can only imagine the end. 

[Mike sighs]

Mike: All right, ladies and gentlemen. We've made it to the end of the screenplay, and I found something shocking. A discovery that's, that will, quite frankly, shock most of you.

[Mike points at the script for Episode III]

Mike: "Lord Vader, can you hear me?" "Yes, Master." "Where is Padme?" "...it seems in your anger, you killed her." Vader says, "I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible!" Now here it is, folks. Here it is. "No!!!" One "o". There are three exclamation points, though, but only one "o". Only one "o"...to me, I'm as shocked as opening a brand new box of Cheeri-o's, and pouring it out, and one "o" falls into the bowl. Imagine that. One "o" in a box of Cheeri-o's. 

[Cut to Mike, out on a bike path, as two cyclists slowly make their way toward him]

Mike: Oh, my god!

[Mike dives out of the way into the bushes]

["Hold On" by Jet plays, as Mike sits on some forlorn steps. He holds out his microphone to someone off-screen, but hangs it in disappointment when they pass by. He picks a lone petal off a flower, and holds it to the microphone, seemingly in hopes that it has something to say]

[Cut to Mike standing in front of a poster at a local cinema for a new movie called "Yes", starring Joan Allen and Simon Abkarian. Mike looks at the camera and shakes his head no]

[Mike interviewsk the man from before on his porch]

Mike: Uh, what was your least favorite part about the movie.

Man: The whole thing. Definitely.

[Mike stops a man who is holding a gallon of milk]

Mike: Have you seen "Star Wars: Episode III"?

Man: No. I heard it's terrible.

[Mike stops to interview two cyclists who are unlocking their bikes from a bick rack]

Mike: Uh, have you seen the latest Star Wars movie?

Man 1: I have not.

Man 2: No.

[Mike interviews a college-aged woman with purple hair]

Mike: Have you seen "Star Wars: Episode III"?

Woman: No, I haven't seen any of those three that have now come out.

[Mike interviews two people passing by who do prefer not to be on camera]

Mike: Have you guys seen the new Star Wars movie?

Man: No.
Woman: Sorry, no.

Mike: Why not?

[Mike approaches a woman on the sidewalk]

Mike: Have you seen the new Star Wars film, the--

Woman: No.

Mike: You haven't?

[Another woman passes by, holding a small arrangement of flowers]

Mike: Have you seen the new Star Wars film?

Woman: No, I haven't.

Mike: Really? Wow. No one's seen it.

[Mike walks down a different sidwalk]

Mike: Revenge of the d-...Sith? Return of the Sith? Land of the Siths? George A. Lucas' "Land of the Sith".

[Mike interviews the purple-haired woman again, this time accompanied by a college-aged man]

Man: I don't know. I, I went because somebody else wanted to go. I'm really not a Star Wars fan. I just kind of had to suffer through it. 

Woman: I don't think true Star Wars fans go to see those movies, actually.

[Mike raises his eyebrows at the camera]

[Onscreen text: WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I SPAKE AS A CHILD, I UNDERSTOOD AS A CHILD, I THOUGHT AS A CHILD: BUT WHEN I BECAME A MAN, I PUT AWAY CHILDISH THINGS. - The first letter of Paul of Tarsus to the school at Corinth: Chatper 13, Verse 11]

[Cut to Mike and Rich Evans. Mike is standing close to the camera, and Rich Evans is slightly in the background, reclining in a green chair]

Mike: Due to copyright law, and things of that nature, we weren't able to show you the actual scene, but, uh, we're recreating it as best we can. 

[Mike flips his hoodie up, and assumes the posture of tone of Lord Palpatine]

Mike [off-screen]: Arise, Lord Vader.

[Rich Evans, costumed as a derelict Lord Vader, inclines his seat]

Mike: How do you feel, Lord Vader?

Rich Evans: Where...is...Padame? Is she all right?

[Mike looks around, shiftily]

Rich Evans: Is she safe?

Mike: Um, I'm afraid in your anger, you killed her.

Rich Evans: That can't be. I felt her. 

[Special effects start happening. Rich Evans stumbles forward, and turns upwards, towards the camera]

Rich Evans: Noooooooooo!!

[Various media files of Star Wars creator George Lucas appears onscreen, accompanied by Johnny Cash's "The Man Comes Around". Roll credits]
