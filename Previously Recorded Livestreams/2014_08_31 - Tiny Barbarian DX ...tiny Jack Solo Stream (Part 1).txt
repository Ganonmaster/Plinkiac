We wish them the best. 
Happy Canada Day?
Cool, Canada, too. Yay holidays.
What? 
Are you, Mr. Primal asks, am I amazed by Jay and Mike's talent?
The Samurai Cop interview was great.
I'm, I mean, constantly in awe of Jay.
I think they, I think they did a really great job. 
Um, I, you know, I, I've actually, I've only seen Samurai Cop, the movie, once. 
I was not involved with the original find of the Samurai Cop movie, and so I was really glad, um, not to be involved in that one.
I was, you know, behind the cameras, making sure everyone sounded and looked okay. 
Um, but I, I think they did a great job.
It's, it's, the, I want to say they talked to him...
We were shooting, I want to say for two-and-a-half, maybe three hours, uh, and so I think they did a great job cutting it all together.
No, it's not Canada Day?
What?
Oh, it's Labor Day.
Yeah, tomorrow is Labor Day, so pour one out to all the laborers.
As you already know, as I've been chatting, today, uh, I'm pouring out a, uh, a Lakefront Brewery Extended Play
A really great, smooth IPA.
And, normally -- or, ISA is what they call it -- and I normally don't like IPA's. 
Of course, I only drink IPA's because they're a higher alcohol content.
I, and John Kilo, I do not know when the second part of the interview will be released.
I'm, I'm pretty sure that they just released it in two parts just so they could get something out quicker.
CandySmack, you're drinking Stiegl and gin.
You lucky son of a bitch.
I ran out.
Jay drank my last one.
And I'm okay with that, because he's my friend.
So, I don't know when the second one will be released.
Hopefully, I can only imagine this week.
I mean, you know, it's...interviews are pretty easy.
All right, you know what?
We're gonna get to the game here.
We have a super fun game to play.
I think.
If we can get it going.
There it is.
We are gonna play Tiny Barbarian.
I have been looking forward to playing this since well before its release.
Um, in fact, I forgot about -- one of the the joys of early access is, I forgot that this game was getting released until it recently went on a Humble Bundle sale.
So I am super excited play this.
Ooh.
Boop bloop.
Okay.
Press attack to begin.
We are gonna play some Tiny Barbarian.
That's me.
Do you see me?
I'm a tiny barbarian.
This is my first time playing the game.
I don't know what's going on.
I was really thinking there would be music.
Why is there no music?
What's going on?
What is happening here?
What is happening here?
Is this the whole game?
No, this isn't the whole game.
Is it, like, an endless fighter?
What do you guys know about Tiny Barbarian?
Apparently, I know nothing.
Oh, okay.
I get it.
It's like a scripted, it's like a scripted thing.
I'm with ya.
No Mario Kart tonight.
I have, I have been receiving some of your Nintendo friend requests, and I will do -- not next week, I'll, I'll be out of town next week, so we won't get a solo stream next week -- um, but maybe, maybe the week after, I will do a, a in-stream Mario Kart tournament.
How's the sound for everybody?
Play some checkers.
I'm not gonna be playing checkers.
I apologize.
You know what?
I'm not gonna play checkers because I'm not as good as Rich.
Rich is too good at checkers.
Oh, my god.
The Serpent Lord.
Okay.
Here we go, guys.
Sound is good.
Volume...
Thank you, Octo-Jay.
I didn't see you, Octo-Jay.
Our lovely mod is here to moderate y'all.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, my god.
This is adorable.
Look at this.
So, it's just jump and attack.
Also, if you press down and the attack button, you flex your muscles.
Shoulder buttons don't do anything.
So this is straight up NES.
I keep looking for, like, secret stuff.
Oh.
Oh, that's neat.
Do I have to press anything?
You have to press up.
Okay, you can press up.
That looks like a secret thing, right?
No?
Okay.
Spikes.
Usually, if someone comes and asks if there are spikes in this game...and the answer is, of course, yes, there are spikes in this game.
That looks like I should be able to...
Oh.
Oh, well.
Doesn't matter.
I keep expecting one of these walls to break away if I slash it with my sword.
That's usually a secret thing.
Hmm.
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.
Oh, my first enemy.
It's a little snake.
Look at how adorable that is.
Look at how adorable, and deadly.
Great.
This is fantastic.
Um...
Get out of here, you bird.
I don't know, like, what else, like, I can...
I can't tell you too much about, about the Matt Hannon interview, because the second part will be coming up.
Just bear in mind, the second half is equally as good.
I, I remember him talking more in depth about, about the style of guerilla filmmaking that they were doing,.
You know, for example, he was talking about just showing up one day and a guy lit himself on fire, and there was no fire truck.
There was no ambulance.
And apparently that's how, that's how they made the movies, is just run and gun shooting.
The director didn't have permits for anything.
Fucking bird.
Come here, I'll...
Wait for him to come to you.
That's the name of the game.
Get out of here, ya bird.
Uh, didn't have permits for anything, but was, uh, exceptionally good at, at bullshitting his way into...
Any game that has a flex button.
Look at that.
Um, was really good at bullshitting his way into locations, and what they would do a lot on Samurai Cop, and I hope I'm not spoiling anything from the next interview, is the director would figure out what big-budget movie was shooting nearby, and just say that they were second unit.
And so it's, like, if, you know, for example, if Tango and Cash were shooting down the street, they'd be like, "Yeah, we're the second unit for Tango and Cash." 
And if anyone hassled them, they'd immediately go, "Oh yeah, no problem. We have permits all over the place today."
Oh, I jumped right into that.
Can you believe that?
I mean, you can, you saw it, hopefully.
So...
Uh...
So that was really fun to hear about, about stuff like that, that kind of, that kind of guerilla filmmaking.
Oh.
Oh, hidden chicken.
It finally happened.
Hidden chicken.
Now I just want more hidden chicken.
No.
Um, that kind of guerrilla style of filmmaking is super fun, especially for, for someone who has done a lot of that.
And in Milwaukee, we don't need to worry about that at all, because in Milwaukee you can film out in public without a permit.
But, still really fun to hear about.
He just had some good...
Oh.
He just had some good stories.
Definitely wanna get up there if I can.
Nope.
Nope.
I do that.
I did it before.
We're gonna be playing Jack-falls-off-of-vines.
Welcome to this episode of Jack Falls Off of Vines, sponsored by Vine.
Simple way to share videos online.
Be social.
Share videos.
Vine.
Oh, fuck.
Come on.
I can do this.
I don't even, I don't even know what's up there or if it's anything good, but I...
Okay, all right.
Just getting the hang of this, guys.
Oh.
Nope.
Nope.
Come, come the fuck on.
Sorry, this requires all of my concentration.
Fuck.
Oh, my god.
There's something up there.
We must have that thing.
Oh, how do you do that?
That's impossible.
Sure, it's not impossible.
Oh.
Oh, I think I've just, I've been pressing down this whole time.
Ugh.
This is tense.
This is intensity, in ten cities.
Oh, fuck you.
I'm gonna do this, guys.
This is the whole stream.
This is the entire night, right here.
Just getting this one vine challenge.
Brought to you by Vine.
Six second video clips.
Six second pieces of life.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
I'm doing what?
Uh, ElvisDelvis asks, "When I do these solo streams, do I do them from the studio or at home?"
Uh, you know, like, whichever is funnier in your head.
If you, if you would like to think that I'm alone, on the Plinkett house set, crying, when I'm not streaming...
If that's...
Fuck.
Fuck you.
If that's funnier to you, or, I've said it, I mean, I've said it before, it's just, I'm, I'm at home.
I'm at home.
Fuck.
Mostly because then I don't need to drag my computer and everything to the studio.
Nope, no no no.
You have to be lower on that vine.
Nope.
Nope.
Jumping the gun.
Jumping the vine gun.
Nope.
I'm gonna give up in a little bit, because I feel bad for you guys watching.
But, normally, whilst video gaming, this is...
Oh, here we go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Fuck.
Normally this is something that would eat my br-...
Oh, I don't even know what happened that time.
I cannot explain to you what happened that time.
Can I plug in my NES controller?
Hold on, guys.
Quick change of p-, uh, plan.
Pause.
Pause for NES controller.
You just heard some things fall off a shelf.
I have...
Whipboned asks if I've tried pine resin.
I have not.
I have not tried pine resin.
But thank you, you big jerk.
Okay.
Hold on.
Plugging in my NES controller to see if that works.
I would love it if my NES controller would work.
Come on.
Input device keyboard?
I've been on the keyboard.
Oop, there it goes.
There's the boop boop.
Come on.
I heard the boop boop.
I heard the bloop loop.
As I said, I feel like I need my NES controller.
Give it a work.
We're gonna see if it works.
For some reason, my, my Xbox is not, my Xbox controller is not giving me the responsiveness I need.
You're absolutely right, I need that second flak cannon.
Double flaks all the way.
Come on.
All right.
Hold on a second, guys.
Hold on one hot second.
That's what we're doing.
This is what we're doing.
We're gonna make sure that we're all plugged in here.
Just wait, y'all.
Yeah.
Are you working, or not?
You son of a bitch, you work.
You work, you, you controller.
Installing device driver software.
Go.
Click here for status.
Ready to use.
All right.
Here we go.
Aww, it's not gonna work.
Son of a honkey.
Why is it not working?
Oh.
We tried.
This was a game, much like Shovel Knight, that was designed for the NES gamepad.
Yet, here I am, not able to use my USB NES gamepad.
Okay.
You can just, guy, you guys just get to hear all of the lovely bloop bloops.
Ow.
Everything's fine.
Don't worry
Everything's fine.
All right.
Toggle full-screen.
Here we go.
Coming back.
Resume.
Okay.
I'm not giving up.
Never, never give up.
Never surrender.
Today's vine challenge, sponsored by Vine.
It's tragic.
If you jump too soon...
Fuck you.
Like, right here.
Nope.
Okay.
Yes!
Was it worth it?
I don't know.
Get out of here.
Chicken!
Yes.
Always chicken.
Oh.
Okay, you can't touch the sides of the spikes.
Putting that out there.
Oh.
I don't know if you guys can see that.
That's one of my moves is, like, the shoulder drop.
Awesomeness.
Noo...
Shoulder-dropped into some spikes.
That's okay.
Eagle.
We have an eagle, guys.
There's an eagle in this game.
I got the first Chaos Emerald.
Ooh.
Hey now.
Okay, here we go.
Killing snakes.
Killing snakes, barbarian style.
This music is great.
Classic.
I feel like there's a secret down here, right?
No.
Just a place for me to die.
And kill a bird.
It's a question of just where's this seeker gonna be.
Fucking bird.
Get out of here, ya bird.
Yes.
Oh, that was neat.
How did I do that?
Oh, okay.
You can just kind of jump.
Secrets.
Oh, you got me, you bastard.
Get out of here.
Chicken?
Oh, yes.
A crystal.
Nice.
Why do assholes call it a Chaos Emerald?
Yeah, I get the joke.
I get the joke.
Victoria20, I'm gonna play this tonight.
I also have, um, I have Super Time Force, which I'm super excited to play.
2D action platformers, that's where we're going, y'all.
We've been together.
Seeing if I can take out that fucking bird.
Did I get that chicken?
Do I get chicken from birds?
Get out of here.
If it's there...
There's got to be something there, right?
There's gotta be a...
Nope.
Apparently, by the way, the answer is no.
I thought a secret...
Oh, fuck.
Oh, no.
I did not realize how bad I was doing.
Oh, good. 
Chicken chicken chicken.
Chicken chicken chicken.
Okay, here we go.
A tiny barbarian, facing a...a what?
Oh, come here.
Gimme shit.
As I beat up this little guy, he gives me things.
Come here.
No.
Give me the chicken.
Gimme that chicken.
Ohh...
Okay, we got all the chicken we could from the little guy.
Love that.
Oh.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Getting snakes, yo.
Getting the snakes, yo. 
This is so enjoyable.
I don't know how we live in a world in which these wonderfully made NES throwbacks happened.
I mean, I know how they happened.
Chock-full of nostalgia, but...
I think, I feel like something like this, or something like Shovel Knight could have turned out really poorly.
I mean, I can't use my NES USB controller.
I can't use my BSUSB.
But...
Fuck you.
Oh, come on.
Come on, tiny barbarian.
Be slightly less tiny.
That helps.
I don't know if you knew that.
It helps.
Oof.
What are you saying there, Jack.
Recommend some horror films.
That's not my department.
That is, uh, that's Jay.
Jay's the horror film...
Awesome 8-bit muscles.
Uh, Jay's department is all horror.
You're right, BlockCastleHunkerDown.
Shovel Knight does not just stop anything of nostalgia.
It is its own game, and experience as is this.
I'm really enjoying this.
his is definitely more just nostalgia, whereas Shovel knight is, would have been a great game in any art style.
It just happens to be a great game in 8-bit art style.
Did you guys see That?
Did that move the top of the screen?
Oh.
Get out of here.
I killed men!
I'll hit you again, too.
Oh, there's gotta be something up there.
I have all these things.
There we go.
There we go.
That's the way, the way of all their video games.
Fuck.
Can you show me this new way?
Hey, get there, you dick.
You tiny barbarian dick.
I don't care about it that much, whatever is over there, which I'm sure is nothing.
Hiya!
Whoa.
That asshole just threw a spear at me.
Get out of here, asshole.
You dingus.
Get over here.
Get out of here.
Get over here.
Bird.
Fucking bird.
I gotta take care of this bird first.
Bird, bird, bird.
I don't know if you guys knew this, but the bird is the word.
Putting that out there.
Oh, I wanna do that.
Can I do that?
There's extra gold if I take those mines.
Oh, you dick.
Yes. 
Yes.
Oof.
I got started shoulder dropping more people.
Just cuz I can.
Get outta here, bird.
Fucking bird.
Is that an eagle?
Fuck you, symbol of freedom.
Oh, you can hit 'em.
Oh, no you can't hit 'em.
And I died.
Yay.
First death. 
And I don't know what it is guys, but I've run out of my snack much earlier than anticipated.
Hold on.
After we got another snack.
Pause.
Pause for a moment.
Snack run.
Okay, I'm back.
It's true.
One, John Kilo, one beer equsl Jack drunk.
It's true.
It's true.
And it is the holiday weekend.
Oh, do you can hear me pour?
Yes.
A perfect pour!
You know why it's perfect?
Because it's in a glass.
Okay.
Here we go.
Another beer.
What?
What is making that noise?
Oh, it's the game.
Oh, no.
Pausing it might have broken it.
Did pause it, did pausing it break it?
Oh, there we go.
Okay, pausing it did not break it.
We're okay.
All right.
Here we go.
Elbow drop.
That's how you got to deal with those guys.
Take 'em out.
Right to tweet.
And...sword.
Eagle fir...oh.
I wasn't facing the Eagle.
Come here, eagle.
Face me like a man, eagle.
Get out of here.
Haha!
You're dead.
And this guy I can probably elbow drop.
Yah!
I am the Barbarian.
Get outta here, get outta here.
I remember when I first heard about development of this game, and there, there were some early tests and some screenshots.
The only reason I followed, uh...
I wanna say this is made by Squall, Squall Games.
I followed them on Twitter just so I could keep up on development of Tiny Barbarian.
And I think I gave up rather quickly because it was gonna be a Windows-only game.
But now I can play it cuz that dual-boot. 
Elbow drop.
Oh, okay.
All right, we're coming for ya.
Or, we're not coming for you.
Never mind.
I'm going back around.
Damn.
Nope.
Oh, no.
Get out of here.
Dammit.
There.
Get out of here.
Barbarian!
Time and...
Gonna lose.
Gonna lose because I got that diamond.
Goddammit.
I feel great.
I feel great about this.
Oh, no, he's doing his cheeseburger voice?
Oh, I do that every once in a while.
I don't know if you guys have seen Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.
Uh, but there's a moment when the computer says "Cheeseburger!"
I can only assume that's what you mean by cheeseburger voice.
Okay, I'm facing a cannon.
What?
What, I'm facing a cannon?
Get outta here.
Oh, my god.
That's kind of dumb.
I'd like to be able to hit more than once.
And, elbow drop!
Cheeseburger!
Oop, he's not dead.
Yeah.
Now you is.
Checkpoint, all right.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Someone is asking me if I drink warm beer.
What?
Warm beer?
Someone is saying, "Jack, can you have somebody solo stream instead, or two group streams because you won't be here next Sunday?"
Uh, I will talk to Rich about that, and see if he wants to try his very first solo stream.
Um, that's not a bad idea because I won't be here next Sunday.
We will, will definitely do a group stream on -- I can't climb up that -- we'll definitely do a group stream on Wednesday, like we normally do.
Fact about this?
How do I get up there?
Oh, fuck.
Um, mir, mirma, mima....MiMa just subscribed.
What?
MiMa, you've been here for a while, and you've just subscribed?
Welcome.
Welcome to the pizza rolls.
Welcome to the cheeseburger.
Look at this guy.
Get out of here.
Rich was born...
Rich was born for primetime.
You know. it's, Rich, I don't know if you guys have noticed, but Rich has a small problem talking and playing games at the same time.
Uh, to the point where it's a little silly.
Rich, Rich is a little silly about it.
His, his lack of ability to talk and play at the same time can, might, might, uh, hinder...
Oh, my god.
Might hinder the stream.
Jesus Christ.
Get outta here.
I, I mean, I know you guys know that, if it's a really intense moment, all you, all you'll hear out of me is a little um's and er's and...
Hey, get over here, you bandit.
Oh.
Oh, I let him...
You, you, you dickhole.
I needed some chicken out of that guy.
So it's not all, that's why I do, like, the group stream.
I think, particularly, last Wednesday when Rich was playing X-COM, and not saying a goddamn thing, but Jay and I were having really good conversations.
So I hope you guys liked that, too.
You know, a little game, game kind of as background, right?
And, and some just good conversations.
I felt really good about Wednesday's stream, conversation-wise.
Ooh, that's nice.
Look at that.
Did you see that level design?
They gave me something to go for down here so I knew that I could drop down.
I bet that'll play, I bet that'll come into play later on where I need to drop down.
Ooh.
Get outta here.
Ooh.
Not gonna get me, spearmaster.
Hahaha!
That's what your...
What is that?
You guys, I think I get to ride that thing.
I think I get to ride that thing.
I think I get to ride that thing.
I get the [indecipherable].
Oh, no.
Come back!
Come back, my friend!
I'm sorry.
Oh, my Yoshi.
Look at that.
You can double jump on him.
Get the fuck out of town.
I love this.
Okay.
You come, too.
We can make that jump together.
Together, my beastly friend.
Oh, I have to leave him.
But I love you, monster thing.
Oh.
I made that.
You guys saw that I made that, right?
Yes!
He's coming with me.
Come.
Come with me, super beast,
I need this chicken first, though.
Now, let's go!
Num-num-num-num-num!
Num-num-num-num-num!
Look at him!
Num-num-num-num-num!
Chicken.
Hold on, super beast.
There is chicken to be had, and I'm gonna get it.
Oh, no, I need you.
Hey.
Come.
Come, super beast.
We need chicken.
Yes.
You and me.
Chicken!
Okay.
Oh.
All right, we need this.
Every healing item in games is chicken to Jack.
That's true, MarioMario.
But first of all, I mean, they've all been chicken.
In the few games that we've played where there are healing items, there's, there's been chicken.
Oh.
I'm gonna get this.
I don't know what's up there, probably just...
Oh, maybe a diamond.
Come, my special friend.
Yes.
Ooh, a diamond.
Shining bright like a diamond.
Let's go.
Let us go, majestic bea--
Oh, fuck you.
You hit my majestic beast.
I won't kill you, my majestic, kind of ugly beast.
Hahaha!
I am king barbarian, and this is my noble speed, steed.
We will call him Turnip.
Hahaha.
Turnip, go!!
Um-num-num-num-num
Num-num-num-num-num-num!
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num!
I kind of love this.
Mmm.
Yes I just quoted Rhianna.
[indecipherable]
That's one I'd do.
You know why?
I like girly pop.
I can't help that.
Fuck you.
Are you okay, monster?
Good.
Monster, jump!
Num-num-num-num-num.
Wait.
Is there something over there?
A thing that I could...
No, no there wasn't.
Let's go!
Num-num-num-num-num!
Num-num-num-num!
Oh, I didn't forget about you guys.
Comin' after ya.
Num-num-num-num-num!
I will be back for you, my steed!
Fucking bird, like I don't, like I don't know what your deal is already, bird.
Oh, yeah.
Saw ya.
Yes.
Exploration is rewarded!
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num!
You fuck.
Num!
He's gonna eat you.
Num!
Num, num-num-num! 
Just because you're a fuck.
It seems like something I can get up.
Nope.
Nope.
Okay.
Okay.
Hold on.
Just gonna check.
Are you guys talking about birds?
Or, the beaks?
Beaks.
Are you talking about beaks?
Um, am i enjoying it?
I'm not enjoying Old Milwaukee.
I think we've talked about this before.
I, I do enjoy, in general, Old Milwaukee Light, as a fine, that is a...
Oh, no.
I am not leaving you, friend.
That is a fine light beer.
Um, we, we're talking about Pass Me a Beer 3.
We have a couple really fun ideas.
I think I have to leave my friend there.
I think the game wants me to leave my friends, but I don't want to leave him.
He's my friend.
So I'm just gonna prance with him for a little bit while I read your comments.
I do, yeah, Old Milwaukee Light is fine.
And, you know, after, after three or four other beers, really anything you put in ya is gonna taste the same.
Old Milwaukee is a fine, cheap beer.
I like Old Milwaukee.
I like Pabst.
I like Miller Lite sometimes.
You know why?
Cuz sometimes I'm just thirsty, and want some water, so that I drink Miller Lite.
Goo, snap!
Snap.
Mm-hmm.
Um, I did see the fake concert ticket.
And who put that up?
I thought that was really funny.
Because we were talking about Nicki Minaj.
I have to leave my friend.
Friend, you will be missed.
I present to you, my muscles.
Goodbye.
Oh, oh, you can climb the ropes.
Good to know.
Wait.
Check for trinkets.
Ah, so no matter what, I would have had to get rid of my friend.
Oh, my god.
How did I do that?
Did you guys see that super special move?
How did I do that?
Should I jump off?
Yes.
I did.
Oh.
Yes, exploration is rewarded!
Hello, friend.
I'm sorry to leave you here yet again.
Combo mvoes.
Oh, combo moves.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
It must be...
Yes, this game moves so smooth.
Must be the blast processing.
Oop.
Here we are.
I think we're finally out of...
Oop.
You dicks.
Oop.
Oop.
Ladies.
Yeah!
Exactly what I wanted to happen.
Exactly what I wanted to happen.
That was wonderful.
What was that?
Chicken.
Oop.
What is that?
Get out of here.
Oop.
Skeleton in here, and I'll getcha.
Is there any rhyme or reason for which bricks can be...
I don't think so.
Oop.
Nice.
Flawless!
Cheeseburger.
Now you just have me thinking about that cheeseburger voice.
I don't know if you guys know this, but Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is a really great movie.
That Miller and Lord, they make good stuff.
They did, uh, they did Lego Movie.
They did, uh, 21 Jump Street.
They did, uh, they did Cloudy.
Oh, wait.
So that was a secret.
Okay.
Miller, Miller and Lord.
Writing duo.
Who does some weird stuff.
Who makes movies that shouldn't work, but somehow do.
Yeah, do it!
Oh, sorry.
Getting excited about...Tiny Barbarian. 
Umm...um, OctoJay has yet to request any Rich Evans nudes, but, you know, I'm not saying they're out there, but, but the thing I'm not saying.
That's, that's, that's what I'm gonna say.
I'm not gonna say that there are Rich Evans' nudes out there in the world, but that thing that I'm not saying.
So you guys can put that together any way you want.
Oh, wait.
Oh, oh, oh, you can't go back.
Oh, fuck you, game.
Ooh.
Oh.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Floating platforms.
Always floating platforms.
That's the only way I want to kill bats now.
Oh, they're just gonna keep coming.
Aww, dammit.
Oh, no.
Uh, TotallyNotAJoke asks, uh, says, Jack, please explain the absolute masterpiece that you created: Hey Hey, Heehee, the Peepee Song.
Doesn't it speak for itself?
It was just, it was a silly song that I thought was funny, and I thought...
Oh, fuck.
...uh, I thought it would be a funny video.
That's it.
That's it.
I thought, I thought it would be really funny to have a guy look really stupid, and, uh, when I can't pay for actors, the guy is you.
That's how I work sometimes.
I'm sure...
It seems like there'd be a secret down here.
Yes.
Chicken?
But I spent life to get here.
Fuck you.
Kind of a little, that's a little fuck you.
Uh, so that's it.
That's, that's the entirety of my story for the Hey Hey, for the Peepee song is, it's a dumb little song that I was singing one day because I do that sometimes, and I thought it would be funny.
And I think it is.
I think it's very funny.
I think it's very funny that anyone would, that anyone would sing that song.
So I think it holds up.
I think it holds up just fine.
Proud is maybe not a word I would use, but, you know, I like it.
I know that's a thing that the people on the internet fixate on.
I know that because that's one of the very few videos that I have on my youtube channel that get views regularly, so I know, I know it's you guys.
I know you guys are watching it because that's about it.
If I could have hired any actor for the Peepee song, any actor, who would it be?
You know, it would have to be someone...what I was going for, I was, I was going for, like, a really bad timing.
This is very obvious.
I was going for a really bad, like, children's show host, and so I would have wanted someone like, like, Steve Burns who did the, uh, Blue's Clues.
Uh, you know, someone who, who was a, uh, a children's host, a children's programming host, because that's the joke I was going for is, like, it was like a really bad children's programming song.
So, in lieu of, in lieu of actual celebrities, that's what I will say is I wanted it, I wanted it to look like I was trying to make...
Oh, fuck.
I wanted it, I wanted it to look like I was a, like I was trying to make legit children's song, which of course it's not.
It's a ridiculous song, uh, but, you know, if I, or maybe, you know what, maybe, like, maybe like a, like a, like a lady host.
I dunno.
Just some dumb song I made.
I think it's funny.
And I think it's funny.
Hey hey, hee hee...
Oop.
We all think different...
Get outta here, bat.
Bat!
Bat.
I get that bat with my sword.
Get outta here, bat.
Bat.
Bat.
Bat.
That helps, by the way.
IT helps if you say the name of the thing that you're hitting with your sword, real-...
Oh, good.
Come here.
Come here, dingus.
I need chicken.
Oh, come here, come here, come here, come here.
Don't run away, don't run away.
I got a chicken from him.
That's all that matters.
I got, I got me my chicken.
Bat.
Bat.
Bat.
You think, uh, you think I'm joking, but it really does help.
See, look.
What happens when I don't say bat?
I don't hit the bat.
Oh, fuck you, bat.
Bat!
Who needs some chicken?
Oh, fuck.
Boss battle.
And, dead.
All right.
But...
And by swords, Jack means penis.
Ooh, there's some chicken.
That's good to know. 
I don't want chicken yet because it's boss battle time.Can I knock his bombs back at him?
Yes, yes I can.
Don't...
Oh, okay.
He's got his whip.
Nope, okay.
All right.
Nope, I, I knew it, yeah, I saw that coming, you jerk.
Could use a super move right about now.
Ooh, there we go.
There we go.
Yeah blow up on him.
Oh, ech.
New sub, EdWhitten.
Hey, EdWhitten.
Thanks for subscribing.
I totally appreciate it.
And thank you, OctoJay, for letting me know when people subscribe because I miss it sometimes.
Oh.
Yes, oh, I gotcha.
Oh, gotcha.
Oh, gotcha.
Oh, come on.
Down.
Oh, he's getting me, guys.
He's getting me.
Knock the bombs to where he'll jump.
Yeah, I need to dodge the bomb, and then get close so he jumps.
Come here.
Throw a bomb.
Oop.
Throw a bomb.
Oh, okay.
All right.
Now you're just, now you're just being difficult.
What?
I had this down before, and I'm missing it now.
Well, at least I got it.
I'll get this.
The horny whippers.
Ha.
Jack, stop being terrible.
Absolutely.
I'll work on that.
I'll work on getting good.
That's my number one priority right now.
Getting good.
Hey, now.
Hey, now.
Okay.
Okay.
Shakma!
Oh, SeanofNoise, that's exactly what I wanted to hear.
Oh, I can't forget the first chicken up there.
Oh, fuck you, guy with bomb.
That should have hit him, too, right?
Every time I, every time I think I have this, as it turns out, I spectacularly do not.
Okay.
Don't run into the bomb after you, don't run into the bomb after you hit it.
Got it.
Throw the bomb.
Hit it.
Jump.
There we go.
There we go.
Get outta here.
Oh.
Fuck you and your bomb throwin' ass.
Get outta here.
Pro-tip.
Thank you.
Protip: try not getting hit by bombs.
You're right, you're absolutely right.
Tiny Barbarian, what is best in life?
To hear the screams of your enemies and the lamentations of your women.
Uh, everyone should go see here Conan the Barbarian.
And The Destroyer.
That's good, too.
This is my plan now.
Well, this hit the bomb.
I'll wait him, I'll wait for him to come to me.
Oop.
Not working the best, but, you know, I'm staying alive fractions of seconds longer.
There we go.
What if I get really close to him?
There we go.
There we go.
Dammit.
Nope.
Okay, not too close to him.
I have to get close enough to him to where he's throw-, or, far enough to where he's throwing...
Oh, fuck.
Okay.
You're right.
Arnold would probably win this game.
Dammit.
Come on.
I'm getting my tiny barbarian ass handed to me.
What in the what?
What in the what?
Because I can't hit him with my sword.
I want to pick up the bomb, but I know I can't do that.
Like, you would think it would be knocking the bomb back at him.
But that doesn't work because if you knock the, you know, the bomb drops...
Ah, fuck you.
The bomb doesn't knock back.
It just kind of drops dead.
How did you know I was gonna be there?
I didn't know I was gonna be there.
You're right, TotallyNotJake. 
You got this, Jack.
Just focus and keep your eye on the prize.
Focus.
Okay.
What is he doing here?
How can I beat him?
Nope.
Already down.
Already down a little life peggle there.
I have to let him jump over me, is the thing.
Dammit.
Dammit, bomb.
Power bomb.
Jumps over me.
Is that it?
Is this, is this the whole game?
Nope.
Oh.
Come on.
Now that's, that wasn't just not nice.
Oh. 
Oh, okay.
Okay.
I think I'm getting it.
I think I'm getting it.
I think I know how to beat him.
Okay.
So I need to be. like. this many blocks away.
Nope.
This many blocks away.
Nope.
A little bit further.
Like this, this here.
That bombs gonna come back and get him.
There we go.
Oop.
There we go.
There we go.
Now we're bomb dropping.
Oh.
Oh, what?
What?
Ughh, ohh...that was a close one.
That was a close one.
I got this, though.
I, well, I mean as much as I had it before.
There we go.
I gotta get that bomb behind him for the next time.
All right, all right.
Oh, fuck you.
Bomb ass...bomb, ya bomb ass.
There.
There, you need to be on this side
Oh, fuck.
Come on.
Nope.
Okay, too close.
Hit the bomb.
There we go.
Hit you with the bomb.
Oop, too close.
Okay.
He's gonna throw bombs, too.
All your minions are dead, yo.
Oh, fuck you.
Get outta here.
Oh, no.
I hit that with my sword.
I can't, uh, I can't choose when I do the thrust attack.
The thrust attack is just after three.
Here we go.
Back away from him.
Let him throw his stupid bombs.
Throw your stupid bombs.
Get out of the...
Son of a bitch.
Oh, son of a bitch.
Yeah, come here.
Oh, too close.
Oh, fuck you and your moblin minions.
Yeah, these are not, these are not good spikes.
The spikes only take one health.
There we go.
Get that over him.
Get hit.
And wait for him to throw bombs.
Ooh, gotcha with your own bombs, yo.
What are you gonna do, throw more bombs?
Weird.
Oh, too close.
Okay.
Already?
Guys shouldn't be here already.
All right, come on, throw your damn...
Throw your damn bombs, yo.
Fucking, one of these bombs needs to hit this guy.
Oh, fuck you.
Come on, come on, come on.
There we go.
Fuck you, guy.
Come down here and fucking fight me.
Don't...what?
This guy.
We're gonna get this guy.
I can tell you that.
I can tell you that we're gonna get this...fuck...
Oh.
Oh, okay.
This is interesting.
Okay.
Apparently, we can use the stab attack to throw a bomb at him.
Okay, okay.
We got, we have where we...
We now have some new information.
We now have some new information.
Oh.
Oh.
I think we just did it.
I think we just did it.
I think we just did it.
Jump!
