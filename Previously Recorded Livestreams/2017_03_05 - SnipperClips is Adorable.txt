why everybody's sing breath of the wild
everywhere sure nobody is seeing snip
snip or Clippers is also a game we get
to play together oh we get to play at
the same time alright that's fine
and then we're calling for snipper clips
that it's it's the runaway snipper clips
well you know strong second place for
dignity which and I'm pretty sure by the
way just dignity is not playing one two
switch anymore which I'm perfectly okay
with it updates automatically you can
just hold on to it yeah
yes nipper Eclipse has got it great
that's great I'm gonna go get a water
and I will be right back a new tip sure
thing where we caught up
we do alpaca the top tip is there Pecha
I'll park on a death camp
alpaca death trap says I don't think you
got my last tip anyways I had to tell
someone this because I'm keeping it a
secret I'm about to buy an engagement
ring
did you hacks do anything special for
your proposals I can't I can't speak for
Jack I didn't I didn't do anything you
know two specials just wanna a nice
night out at the end of the night I got
a ring I didn't I didn't feel a need to
put it on like a Jumbotron somewhere
sister you know quiet private moment
told her how I felt about her and pulled
a ring out of my pocket which she had I
believe she had found the ring earlier
so she knew it was coming but them's
them's the breaks
did you anything did you when he didn't
do anything creative or weird with your
proposal ish yep ish I it was hitting
that point in our relationship where she
you know I remember this story I've told
it before where it was it was very
important to Lisa that we get married
our friends had already gotten married
our other good friends were is that no
where were you able to import that's a
new it's a new me I was not able to
import me all right sorry gone go on our
friends were getting married and our
other friends were getting married and
you she was feeling a little left out
and of course we know we both wanted to
get married but waiting for the time to
be right and she was a bridesmaid for
one of our whoo
oh because it's got to be like this stop
it she was a bridesmaid for one of our
very good friends wedding I guess anyone
you need one too
and so I didn't I was ready to propose
and I had the ring but I didn't want to
do it as because I didn't want to rain
on the parade of our good friends who
were getting married and you're like you
don't want to announce an engagement
during the engagement of someone else's
we were both involved with the wedding
he's adorable and so the the night you
have to cut were you over oh so like ah
I get it she hated more there you go
okay well you cut you cut me now yeah
there you go now you go back to yours so
the the night of their wedding you know
we're all night we're all night at the
wedding and we're having a great time
and we get home and she is still not
engaged yeah and obviously pissed like
and Gina she you have to reform in out
and she wouldn't say anything because
you know we had talked about it before
but she is obviously obviously cut me
man
cut me
what do we have to cut or maybe he
didn't have to cut me how long ago so I
just need to rotate more oh there we go
yeah so she was obviously pissed about
not being engaged yeah and she starts
you know she goes into the bathroom
starts taking off her makeup because
she's a bridesmaid so she's covered in
makeup and while she's doing that I
sneak into her bedroom into my hiding
space where the ring is
and she's jacked being a stupid
boyfriend not my fiance and she comes
she walks back into the bedroom and I'm
down on one knee and I have the ring out
and she just looks at me and she goes
shut up and I was like no really in
genja that like but for a second she
thought I might be joking about the
engagement so she was really pissed at
me for like pretending to to propose to
her and then like she took a moment and
looked at the ring and was like oh you
know over here you get a jump and hit
the button okay so it was a silly it was
a very sad jump on me
okay so it was a very silly situation
and then you know but nothing nothing
terribly special okay none of us hey
guys have you ever considered doing a
live commentary of a public domain film
on Twitch such as Night of the Living
Dead pretty sure it'd be allowed it
might be allowed you know we get asked
this question well actually wait I can't
see the chat at all oh that's a shame
and we get asked that question a lot
like you know a lot of people say like
isn't there a way that you could do kind
of like a live version of best of the
worst it wouldn't be as exciting as you
think well and and that's right you come
over here and I'll snip you duct what's
dark down
well you gonna you gotta raise yourself
I'm not gonna lower you go race you you
need to flip it to the other side
alright okay now you need to just get
where you need to be ya figure this out
raise up that's right yes gimme yeah
nice so ya doing doing any sort of live
commentary like that you guys would be
so freaking bored I was just at a time
yeah well yeah there's a lot of it
there's chunks of silence oh my god
non-stop like think about they wouldn't
care huh they wouldn't care probably but
well you know like already for it be
different shapes maybe they're all
different I just did shape match again
but apparently that's only one thing
yeah so the thing you need to think
about is we watch three movies assuming
each movie is about 90 minutes that is
three four and a half hours right that
is four and a half hours plus then we we
talk about them we you know on the
discussion is approximately an hour if
not more so out of five ish hours you
get maybe an hour long episode one-fifth
of our time is exciting next so you know
any live movie you just wouldn't you
wouldn't get that much funny out of us
are our content is made in editing
all right so wait wait wait wait give me
a cut raise up yeah yeah it's good
all right we need we need an actual
wedge Jack give me another cut you know
oh okay hold on
you wedge in there I got this I got this
hold on yeah back up now slam dunk slam
dunk I'm gonna get it on your head ah
cut me to ribbons jack oh you know what
I was pressing the cut but not the jump
button here this awesome yeah
think of the vault oh shit
how do you think this is funny
okay okay okay jump jump oh okay no no
that's fine crouch down I've got an idea
you know we need a a wedge shape in my
head
wait wait don't do anything okay okay
I'm not doing anything
now you lift it up okay and get that in
my wench I'm with you okay race oh no oh
yeah Jack what flip it I raised it you
didn't raise it you I think we're
overthinking this Jeff wait I'm in the
basket it's almost a slam dunk Jack it's
like a basket okay hold on oh let me
jump
roll into my head
I've waiting head oh you know what is I
think this is easier than we think
look he's hit the button again would you
do that for I don't know why why would
you why would you why I don't know I'm
confused and scared
it's not easy we did it we did it
somehow yeah I get it
this is neat yeah baseball in this game
is lovely yes this game is lovely okay
so if I press this
I get a baseball okay
oh that was easy that was significantly
easier than basketball up
we're probably meant to go across the
top oh no because look at the cow it
reveals he goes up and down Harold I
don't know anything Jack I don't know
anything okay
