his cabin is by the chair by the
cemetery
does anybody have a map do we know if
his cabin if his cabins by the cemetery
or on the other side all right
okay I don't know if we want to go in
yet but as long as we know where it is
do we need to call Tommy according to
the map Tommy has been called who is
anyone called Tommy
Jack I need your backup Jack Jack Jack

towards the cemetery where's it at I'm
half blind with fear I can't see shit

no where's that help so we dropped I
don't see any up hold down on the d-pad
if you're at full health you can just
spray me with it actually the X button
they're probably using the keyboard oh
then I actually don't know there's one
that spawns by the cemetery I'm just
gonna head up there figured a self it
should have a little key prop key prompt
underneath it then it's one on the
keyboard I go oh you're coming Jessie

only ones no no there's four three girls
and Tommy just that Tommy likes it all
right all right you're in charge of
spectating on your camera yeah yeah
the mask is still not off yet though I
know so Red Dead is looking through
houses I don't think reddit is down with
our plan
spectral is just running from Jason at
this point and heading towards the main
house oh oh I see I see I see what's
going on
oh come on Spectre I'll hit him shit

mad plan B strats oh that's true
Plan B strats rented might be near you

oh and you don't have a weapon you have
a pocket knife nope maybe nope oh the
head punch the classic head punch fuck
yeah - fuck that's alright though no
one's for fucked
that's all right let's see here a
crocodile brain says hey guys oh I
should well I guess which is out so you
don't really need me I'm rich let's see
here add me on Steam I can attempt to
kill you as the worst Jason ever since I
just bought the game and therefore a
level one my you know crocodile brain
we'll look into that
rich is gonna riches attempting to
escape here what
I find him on my camp cameras here
fine I'll fucking this up oh no are you
stuck oh there is
let's see here the butt tester says hey
guys I would love to help you out with
my mission but Jack declined my friend
request on Steam I assume it's because
of my name
not really the butt tester rich might be
able to vouch for me i play with him on
Monday you know what happens a lot of
times is we get overrun with friend
requests and so rich is the world's best
backwards driver he is always the best
backwards driver it's that's not that
wasn't like just fuck up going back to
the woods
you go slower if you're trying to get
through tight areas it's not the worst
thing to do excellent job excellent job
gg gg good job captain bowler that was a
fair wind fair wind mask was on there
with fucking superglue so any because
what happens is a lot of times like we
just get so many friend requests on
steams like I don't have any room left
so a lot of times I'll like either
delete requests or delete old friends
who haven't been on Steam in a long time
yeah just to make room for new ones so
it's nothing personal
let's see here dr. Harry Lime says that
was the most fun I had SJC
great when no one is trying to escape
you internet bullies I'm so sorry dr.
Harry and Voodoo I need to be ready
voodoo mama
gonzo says I'm pretty much obsessed with
watching these damn Friday the 13th
streams you guys are doing thanks for
the hours of entertainment if I had a PC
instead of a ps4 I'd be helping you guys
out tonight you know I would love some
crossplane I know that's not necessarily
up to the developers like Sony and other
people would have to agree to it but
some more mixture would be great
just
more some more bodies to play with I
need to check out something part AIDS
Plus no nothing but plus health I don't
know why that wasn't working we just
weren't hitting him we weren't hitting
him hard enough
last time we I think we have like all
seven of us I gave him like eight whacks
with a machete I don't know I don't know
someone is asking if my outfit came
directly from nantucket you know what
it's summertime and the living is easy
and you know I like my my light knit
buttoned up shirts and shorts it's it's
very warm outside so you know what are
you gonna do what are you gonna do
that's Farscape you got hey first of all
you got out right you had the mad plan B
strats yeah car repairs yeah I never got
fucked up someone I don't think of maybe
you could retreat to the car exactly
exactly now that was good that was a
good one
they didn't get it because they thought
it seemed lame what no way talking about
uh-huh
oh the Zelda DLC yeah yeah that's a
trial dungeon and you know what and I
don't think it's lame it just doesn't
interest me at all like I said I I
became very interested when I heard that
if you could defeat the trial dungeon
and get like a better sword maybe a
master sword that didn't lose its magic
I would buy that DLC for a master sword
that didn't wouldn't lose its magic I
would do that in a hardened that what it
is no it's something different it's just
always super powerful something like but
it stole but it still only works against
like the Ganon visit and so it's like
that plan be totally caught me by
surprise quality strats says captain
Miller aka Jason from last stream that's
great no and by the way Captain Muller
like we appreciate that you took your
Jason responsibilities seriously like
you know we're not looking for the easy
kill yeah yeah we you gotta play Jason
for reals that's the rules
specula fan or just somebody's been
hanging with us I think you just saw
these hangers do you fight you know what
he found a group of people who want to
play alright alright alright I'm just
actually scanning for Tommy door in my
vicinity oh yeah yeah you got some
scrounging supplies and Tommy tower

priorities oh shit I got the phone

do about that under your repair stats

anything good for stunning
whose registers reddit about someone
officially in our group but knows that
we're going for a Jason kill in general

Peninsula or down by the road oh we got
check we got to find oh yeah we got to
find the Tommy radio where's it at
spring water and probably show me to
sneak in there no no not yet
okay I just wanted to confirm yeah it is
it is right there
Jevon blunt yep
wait get out the way who hit him with
the machete cuz we'll do more damage and
if he grabs us use your wrench to stun
him before he can kill us
shitty girl for me
Thanks
you're gonna find a radio tower hasn't
been used your I know where that is I
know where that you're you need help
before you don't grab that until you
have yeah you get yourself he'll try I
won't I'm just making sure I'm going I'm
going
I got to find the Tommy Jarvis tower
yeah shit knows what you're up to
yeah the mass grant yeah I have a mess
no where you died nobody use the damn
radio
I found Tommy's radio hello Jason
Mabry call me please I don't know where
I am because of because of my fear all
right just just stay alive just stay
alive Jim I'm gonna head like back
towards where the car was there's that
gazebo there's that gazebo thing that's
where I that's where I'm near when it
now is fucking baseball bat okay well I
have a renter yeah I have a wrench you
smell bad like a fucking certainty all
right I'm dead and by the gazebo
by the car that Kashiwa but a
four-seater yeah where we all were
Harlech died by the gazebo
he had the mask
the Shack is north allah the mask means
you can get into Jason's Shack without
being noticed you're dead
yeah oh oh you oh yeah I forgot you your
mic is hooked up to my computer
yeah Oh Tommy's here Tommy's here who's
Tommy
turbo Jesus is Tommy you got a Tommy
worth their salt but he's killing one of
the girls we only have two girls up okay
captain molar we have Captain molar and
we have P gackt or 40
we have a Tommy we have a female yeah we
have two females
captain molar and Ferg at door 30
SEPA gak door over there I would just
captain to Moeller know where it is I
think he's I think captain molars slowly
making his way I need to buy them time
to the shack absolutely no no not Tommy
not Tommy
it's over Tommy's dead it's over oh not
Tommy oh there's the gazebo it doesn't
matter I know I know I don't think I
don't think Captain Muller doesn't know
that time he's dead yet because Captain
Muller does not have a walkie-talkie you
see
there's rich there's big actor who also
does not have a walkie-talkie oh yeah oh
we did call the police
so theoretically you can get out the
spectro got out if anybody wasn't in
range earlier doesn't have a walk or has
walkie talkie now didn't earlier it's
over Tommy is dead Tommy died so did our
plans of killing Jason
apparently Spectrals friend is Jason
that's what he's telling me so so he's
happy that he didn't die
gasps and the battery okay captain
molars look working on Plan B strats
that's you for grass door
PG ACK door
and that stuff up
guys the cops have been called
they're working on fixing the car still
but the cops have been called man-jack
you remember when you went out with cops
you went out with a car when the cops
were called oh sure there's much fun it
was fun I'm just saying like you you
know you want to survive you can I hope
to head north show you all see what's
happening in Rich's cam
yeah see these two guys these two are
gone stuck on these two front of car fix
ah right behind wrench car listen I get
that cars are more fun
I at this point in the game though I
want to win you know oh shit it was
right behind me
that's a good kid cop says the keys my
club says the keys around Jason
oh my guess what because of because of a
glitch I was watching your character
because of a little graphical glitch I
get to follow around Jason do we come as
being in a private match now this is
everyone wait is everyone in our group
this person Jason is not in our group
look at this my camera just attached
I've heard you can follow Jason in
private matches I've heard that I've
never been in a private match how
interesting
I believe that Jason Jason is red dude
he's not in our group what a weird
little graphical glitch and like look
you can tell it's not right because it's
like cutting off his head and stuff look
at that face that mug hope you found
someone
I can never you know the only problem is
I can never switch off of Jason now
because ya know because once I switch
off I won't be able to go rage mode
activated it's weird yeah it happens
sometimes Jason one bitties zero yeah I
mean that's how it works it's like like
three now damn fucking close got his
mask off had the mask damn fucking close
a couple more you know what a couple
more health sprays and we would have
been there but we got ourselves rich we
are we we are on a good path here I'm
feeling like runnin ya know if we can
keep this group together yeah that's the
important fucking thing looks like no
one's leaving looks like no one's
leaving let's see here
des clown Steen this is Jack are you an
anime fan have you guys seen and have
you guys seen Stargate you must watch it
well that's somebody who knows exactly
will Mike be here for the next stream is
JK lol Chuck my rock also rich do you
like Julie not do you like playboy don't
believe that Ritchie like Blade Runner
the you know JJ is a what-do-you-call-it
he's a he's a splatter sexual he's only
attracted to horror movies all right
did you if you have you seen younger J
they make shit we've done like like
fresh out of high school J oh sure like
like a like in what is it called in your
alien movie what was that called the
alien even the gorilla yeah like in
gorilla in triplets and and like early
half in the bags
sure alright once J realized he could
look attractive yeah he just went all-in
god yeah that's all this is good for him
oh my god I am a handsome man I remember
like when he was you know cuz I've
always I've always known J with the chin
strap chin strap drink right and as soon
as J like he decided just 1/2 L you know
see how the mustache looks he's like oh
shit this looks great and then yeah he
started doing his hair up all nice lost
a bunch of weight handsome man
oh so close yet completely wasted so
close it completely winded got it no no
captain bowlers left
kept the molars an MVP I had that mass
they went to the share oh and VP oh look
at this look at this wow that's exciting
just barely I miss Hobbit Jay King
that's what he had that's what that
hairstyle is called the chinstrap
that's just what he had forever I'm
guessing rich realized he was wrong
about the tongues festival when he
watched the episode immediately
afterwards I checked I was like you know
I was gonna hem in hall and well maybe I
ever that's enough fuck it you know what
yeah
it's funnier if I go along with it
absolutely I still thought it was right
of course I thought you'll either either
I'm gonna look brilliant or like the
biggest moron in the face of the earth
and you know either way is good for
ratings where's me it'll be really funny
if I'm wrong yeah but I don't think I am
I remember I clearly remember samurai
copy well and it's it's so funny because
if you were right it wouldn't have even
bet you like you would have made your
tongue festival comment and that like
all of that argument would have been cut
out oh yeah oh yeah all of it yeah so
because you were wrong it turned out for
the Bates to be fair when I was acting
sure JJ so he actually said to me you
know if you're wrong I'm gonna it's
gonna it's gonna be bad yeah it's gonna
be here that's the problem
exact problems rich my camera my my
screen looks infrared because for I'm
having a weird being maybe because like
I'm going through the elgato it's
actually like making my monitor darker
than it normally is and so I had to turn
the gamma in-game all the way up to max
so ultra Jason that's all I could not
get the mask off of oh oh I'm Jason can
we reposition your seating so you can't
see the screen so I can't see your
screen yeah I will I will not look at
your screen Chad tell me if he looks at
my screen why I'm here here's what I'll
do alright harlech is I'll wait I don't
have a mic yet okay look it's even like
I can see you in my peripheral but I
can't see like where you are what you're
doing alright alright of course by the
way you can see my screen very easily I
could I'm not gonna look over right
we're both gonna be you can tilt yours
more actually anybody yeah I've made it
a little bit harder for me to see what
you're up to I don't know if that's as
important well I'm trying to you know
look away from yours I know I know I am
I am looking away from yours I can't

just to ring in Jack was nice enough to
bring his PC into the studio and we have
two PC's here and so now we are we are
both playing the game trying to kill

already fixed this controller what was
even wrong with your controller it

wasn't able to use any of my powers and
I fixed it the same way I broke it by
just magic happen magic circumstance I
think this games having issues I don't
know what the fuck is going on yeah
they're heavier I wasn't able to use
right trigger to swing the weapon
yesterday I could not use the controller
at all whenever I tried to start the
game with the controller the game said
user of like failed log and could not
log in could not log into the servers
really yeah but only when you were using
it when I went to use a keyboard to
start you know mouse a keyboard to start
the game
it would log into a server by Tommy by
Tommy you done
so close so close you know I could start
I can login with mouse and keyboard but
then the controller wouldn't work at all
and then if I started the game with the
controller I couldn't login to a server
I don't understand how does that was
like the controller is fucking related
to fucking logging the game into a
server I so such a fucking weird glitch
it would have factoring in the review if
it happened beforehand there's so many
little problems and a few big ones still
apparently ya know and it's weird like I
said the controller just bugged out and
so for the first five minutes I was
unable to use any of my powers look I
mean luckily I knew where all the
counselors were cuz they were you know
bunched up trying to kill me
rich what would be more awkward having
someone show up to your door to talk
about Jesus or someone showing up to
talk about Stargate the answer is
clearly Stargate clearly like people
showing up your door to talk about Jesus
that that's just shit the religious
people do way they can spread in the
word that's just something to do having
somebody show up at my door just talking
about talking about Stargate means I
have a stalker sure and that is bad they
will never ever ever ever kill Jason
keep so close don't say we won't you
don't know you don't know nothing
yeah yeah fuck you die and and my
favorite part it's like you know why
that's my favorite it's like a casual
decapitation you know like it's not it's
not a full decapitation it's just like a
cache it doesn't try that hard right
he's like I guess are you guys reviewing
this game tintin editing yep yeah have a
good chunk edited already we got a
little rambley so it's a little yeah
that was pretty good discussion it was a
good discussion like I said just rambley
like and so like piecing it together is
a little harder than originally thought
even with our notes yep because you know
why we did not follow our outline oh my
god rich what if I just want to hand
deliver their Stargate thesis to you
since you confirmed you received it
since you never confirmed you I
confirmed I received it I just
acknowledged that I never read it
right and that still means I have a
stalker
g-g-g-gia
good game guys my power started working
again and that's how I was able to
murder you all you know well what a fun
game what a fun game this is won't by
the way you know what that's the nice
counterbalance as far as like the the
kill Jason strat is everyone was so Cano
they had the strat of killing me and so
they weren't really working on escaping
right right it takes a lot of team
working a lot of patience and it still
might not happen oh yeah we'll give it a
couple more tries
we'll give the old Jason death a couple
more turn you got a stick with it when
you were the good group oh yeah we could
use one more though right one two three
four five six seven we could use one
more so like Alice says hey rich and
Jack hi if I gifted you guys a
top-of-the-line gaming PC would you
actually use it constantly yeah you know
a problem that we have a problem that we
often have here is because we run OBS
off of the computer that is our gaming
PC some games act funny yeah right and
we have actually talked extensively
about building a separate streaming only
computer a computer just for streaming
just for processing this room exact
playing the game so one computer to play
the game send that video to another
computer to process the stream it would
make things significantly easier on us
how we would get that PC would be a
whole nother ball of wax and how we
would have to spend a couple days like
sweeping it for bugs tracking devices
listening devices yeah you know you just
do a format oh I like a full full car
driving that really full bairdi all you
need to do yeah no I'm saying full
teardown you don't know what's hidden in
there so far is Jason or Zelda breath of
the wild your fave game of the year
that's actually a good question they're
two very different games yeah that's
what I was like apples and oranges
experiences here right right how come I
have way worse ping than you do where
we're in the exact same fucking fuck
you know if doom was this year the
answer would be doomed wow that's like
duh did anyone else get away where the
fuck am i oh wait this way is I think
this way is the back of oh you're I can
look again where yeah yeah we're out
we're allies no I spawn in the middle of
fucking nowhere that's awful
Oh someone's someone's calling Tommy
already good okay Tommy's called that
should always be done early
that's why I just happen to get in that
house I heard someone do it Shetty for
maximizing damage output ax would be
preferred
I'm gonna do a little recon to see if
the Shack is up north here
Trank rabbit really if we really want
but then you absolutely fucking have to
stay alive it would be a little bit you
you should be it would probably be
visual try try going up to a high spot
near you of be a little bit now you
should be standing on it yeah
okay shack is not north almost nothing
to my name
I got a machete and a health spray
he's gonna try to meet up with someone
else here and there's Jason Jason that
machete bad
remember what bad Jason's got me already
alright maybe you'll be Tommy maybe
you'll be Tommy maybe I'll be Tommy
wow I think I just need to beat up with
everyone else yeah switch to rich cam
here looks like potential potatoes is is
repairing car we're dead dead is who
said no
oh it's you
good tune good tune okay looks like they
make they're making progress with the
four-seater as far as backups are
concerned
only I've died so far
alright they have gas and battery in the
four-seater nice Tunes Red Dead is
standing around okay redheads moving
potential potatoes picked up a stick
wearing a really nice jogging suit
that's really classy I'm happy with all
the fat the jogging suit fashions look
at those guys it's a great potential
potatoes has a gun nice upgrade gun
upgrade potential potatoes Tommy Jarvis
is on scene spectral is Tommy Jarvis we
got a couple female counselors here
still very possible
Tommy as the keys yeah we got to find
some of these female camp counselors
what happened I feel it I'm not feeling
it
oh I'm not I'm not saying it's gonna
happen but everyone no one no one's
together
currently everyone's everyone's
clustered you know flying around which
like chickens with their heads cut out
there's someone in that building and
then that's not yeah in that building
nope hello hello friend there we go oh
look at that look they'll found they all
found you guys you're all together now
before he died Harlech check the Shack
is not north it's in the southern area
who had keys Oh on their body oh great
I see everyone still so oh shit Jason
say all right Oh Jason's killing another
female yeah doesn't doesn't feel like
it's going to happen
he is coming look where is he Aries here
he comes
Oh starting the car
it worked it actually worked
just go
woman's right he wanted to impress the
captain wants to impress he was with
backwards driving tomahawks
look at this whoa wow this is fairly
impressive until he crashes touch this
Jason go back to that go back to that
Nintendo nice
there you go
there is bye nice oh look we can do the
fun glitch out but oh please oh look
you're all together oh this is a new one
oh my god we've become a Cronenberg
monster that's a new one look at that
you are one now wait we lost one look at
oh look at this we are one now we won
now feed off of a oneness look at that
they escaped Jason only to receive a
worse fate oh that's kind of hypnotic
don't you think wow I just want to keep
it on here in 200 they got stopped on a
rock and look your friends are so back
there please I'm not a part of my hide
no I think you're part of a different
hive I am somebody else with me because
there was four people in the car so I
think you were all smushed together
I'd love to switch over to you but I can
you know yeah oh yeah no you do that as
soon as you switch out you can't get
back and this is too beautiful oh here
we go
there we go look at that witness me
glorious
it's the Michael Jackson thing yeah I'm
black I'm white yeah yeah my brother no
matter if you're black or white so you
know and this this is one of those weird
glitches where if you're following
someone if you're following someone in a
car and there's someone else to a car
right when they pass over the threshold
you quickly switch to viewing another
person and you can follow them out
that's what you do yeah yeah and it
always ends up in a weird coach like
this this is the first time I've ever
seen I've never seen the merge I've I've
seen the boat just keep going off up
into the air space and underground yeah
exactly exactly but I've never seen them
come out of the car and merge into a
single super being like you know it's
fun it's fun is what it is and I just
kind of want to keep it like this
forever Wow Wow Togo sandwich keeps
trying to run away from Jason which is
frankly pretty commendable that he's
last to put is that they have become
tuvok's to veo no we cannot separate -
Vick - Vicks does not want to die
scares all about the group you get one
you get with ya all about that group
well you know there's a dice roll too
you know like we had a pretty good group
this is a different group than we had
last a couple times yeah potential
potatoes is new and I want to save Togo
sasquatches new fed spectral yeah since
we started having the good runs yeah
we've had red how do they kill
themselves in the window they missed it
there is a Stargate episode about this
we just don't I'm sorry
driving what what what who what
Jack's camera view felt like an episode
of Twin Peaks yeah yeah get a light
alright we'll go one more go
just one yeah it's getting late yeah we
can do this we can do this everyone Oh
nope I was kicked host has left the game
alright we'll try to find another group
man try to find it what is the goal the
goal here is to kill Jason and while we
came close a number of times we have not
done it but everybody with us no oh wait
we lost someone yeah we lost we lost a
couple people wait oh wait should we
should we invite some more people I need
to befriend some people all canceled at
us
no I'm sitting at Osama in the chat so
we can see if you're down oh yeah you
came at a bad time because I don't think
it's going to happen but we came really
close are we gonna try this again this
is a question if we don't do this and to
have to yeah no I know I know
add a cock please that necro one from
before you saw we're doing on the
successful runs where everyone gathered
together we had our melee weapons
I just ignored I just ignored all friend
requests so now friend requests me har
lack har la CK and I'll get you in
you've got 10 or 20 seconds clock the
clock is ticking there were quality air
quality I played with them
now he's gotta find yet maybe in the
ease maybe they're not playing right now
they're just still loading up the game
maybe it's in them
Vulcan you're in but there's somebody
people were almost gonna have to find a
private magic but we'll see if we're all
in in a group ever all I'd like just do
sure sure right potent potables
yeah and if they're already in your
friends list here I invited potent
potables I just I just did
okay one two three four five we got five
six six six we need two more or we need
to try and find a match either way okay
all right everybody everybody get your
characters all in order
we need ladies and we need bruisers I
was a lady last time so I'll be a
bruiser this time switch it up I'll
switch it up to bruiser hold on I'm
gonna customize my counts who's my brews
a good bruiser here what stick with the
dude why is ladies playing on alone when
I'm up on my own because they're the
better solo characters later I never
play with with buggy or Bugsy or
whatever his name is or what is what
does he know a guy's deep name even Adam
I never play with Adam unless I'm doing
something like this which is almost
never increased melee attack no age
that's not the perk I thought I had on
there I thought I had a stamina perk
melee attack damage increase for each
other counselor nearby boom and start
match with a baseball bat in hand melee
damage it's also increased boom I'm more
smartly hooked
I am also smartly perks
let's do this old let's rock and roll
I find an axe that would be great that's
no guarantee it will find an axe
we don't need stun duration just damage
maybe I'll find an axe I have bonus
damage with an axe
what say it again if you're hitting you
know be a person with big strength if
you're a lady be a person with good
stamina you choose whichever you want to
do whichever you want to do we just need
a couple ladies in a couple of dudes
however you're feeling it's gonna
probably take us another two minutes to
find another match if you're if you're
if you're less experienced with the game
I'm gonna change my mind it's probably
easier to just to be a random bruiser
you don't want to have the sweater or be
Tommy you just want to be you just want
to be helping dealing damage yeah
there's a lot of pressure if you're yeah
a lot of pressure it's probably better
just to pick like Bugsy or Adam yeah
they just keep whacking Jason I had some
I have some good perks on Bugsy right
now yeah we got increased weapon
durability start with a bat more melee
damage and the more counselors I'm
around the more melee damage I have to
uses from med spray nice I've got
increase your chance of stunning so if I
don't have a weapon that's great it's
stunning at least I got that nice and
increased melee attainment damage with
an axe and it's something like 20% it's
a nice 20% with an axe it's great that's
great I need to find a fuckin axe right
yeah and if I find an axe for machete
and I'm around a bunch of people I do
increase damage yeah so yeah yeah we're
gonna but we're gonna fuck Jason up
husband I do perks work with honey it's
time you get a carryover from your perks
or not that's a great question yeah
enough and then I'm going to assume that
he has no perks but all of his base
stats are good well there is there's one
counselor perk that increased damage
when your tummy oh yeah so maybe they do
kiss you get the other ones too probably
not right I don't know maybe they do
carry over oh here we go we got a match
it's just us so I need a couple more
people here potent potent four six here
nice pings
yeah oh yeah oh I get to pick what map
do we want your perks carry over to
tummy
except for spawn with x-type perks mom
with like the map or something okay that
makes sense
what map do we want right I get to pick
you you pick you pick you know what
don't do Crystal Lake okay I will do
Higgins Higgins Haven we did pretty good
with that one time at Higgins that's
probably easier to bevel yeah there we
go
have a good game it's not a fart
exchange it is what he was about to say
that's not a voice changer now I'm kind
of upset that I don't hear
it's changes
oh this perk is broken still I had the
perk that lets me start with a baseball
bat and as you see I am NOT started with
a baseball bat I've heard it has to be
in the first lot
only then bullshit still bullshit
you gotta Jason on y'all ready
oh well baseball bat in the first house
counts
I got a walkie-talkie
I got fucked
I got lucky I think Jason's busy with
another cancer right now so we got a
little bit of time where you at by one
on the cars it's awfully vague best I
can do man
I'm not by the main house
shit
shit
Jason's on me Jason's on me
ah I went running to be near someone
yeah because of my perk instead of
instead of darn it and instead of trying
to fight or hide or anything I thought
I'd run to be near someone so I could do
some damage shit happens
I know maybe we should do one more I'd
probably do one more I don't want to go
out like this
No where were the first ones out okay
Tommy all right second chances it's
fucking jack second chance
fuck yeah yeah
usually he'll sprain your hand that is
jacent might be screen watching the
stream this isn't one of the people we
invited okay it's not at the campsite so
where so it's on the island and I did
spawn right next to the damn phone box
which is why I got it first
Jason Shack is on the island
you can tell just by looking at the map
this pointer yeah cuz you can see the
camp by them yeah that's why I sold Oh
your buyer I just figured you walk back
I will come and help you for me
damnit damnit
drats drats drats hiding spot stress
I don't go in to find you oh wow you
shift
damnit
wait and see if he runs into it I gotta
find the groom son of a bitch
take that Jason you schmuck I was only
two left
yeah I can hear it was Jason a zombie or
like a crazy man
yes he's whatever the story needs him to
be at the moment I keep an eye on his
pity he is an unstoppable murder machine
that is the only thing that matters as
far as Jason is concerned
is Jack a fan of trap music I'm not
quite sure what trap music is I'm a fan
of hip-hop and I'm a fan of uh like I'm
okay with like some techno music the
dubstep she's got the gas so I don't
know what trap music is necessarily yeah
that's a good one that was spooky as
super spooky trap is shitty rap Oh well
then then no I probably would not be a
fan of trap music like I I enjoy stuff
like over-the-top like like gangsta
and like like over-the-top like Brock
Adagio oh honey she fits she failed
something like ASAP rocky and I think is
really funny that's good or not funny
that's fun that's a good rap nice is a
talker that's fine I you know what a
gray Geiger I am a fan of Twin Peaks I
have not seen the new show yet only
because I don't have Showtime so when I
when I when I eventually pay for
Showtime I'll see the whole series but I
am a fan of Twin Peaks even even the bad
parts of season 2 are are good enough
because of the ending that from Optics a
little bit of luck a little bit of luck
I don't believe vanessa has a very good
repair no she does not
but Jason's pretty busy right now did
Tiffany go back for the keys argh does
Necropolis have her own I don't know two
cars it's not gonna matter she got it
and did she have the keys she has the
keys she has the she has the keys oh
this could happen
what you get back in the car he went to
check the four seater he went to check
the floor seat up here we go here we go
I think he went to the four seater oh
she's new she's new come on come on you
can do it and we believe in you somebody
escaped this monster does she not maybe

wonderful is game now it was filled with
tension is she gonna go the right way oh
she's stuck on the mailbox it was
glorious
it had all all the ups and downs of a
Shakespearean tragedy I can only bind so
I didn't have to keep the keyboard
balance on the arm of this chair so I
didn't hit P to talk we're gonna try get
a pack attack we're going for a kill
yeah we pack a nap he's gonna meet up I
hate the map but from what we're doing I
kind of like it we need some we need
some new maps we need some new shit
calm down reply that was shit was
exciting next live a little
live a little goddamnit
that was super exciting what are they
talking about here on stream that's
amazing I was like it was clear like he
was clear though he didn't like she was
so close the eggs but she went away and
she was like she didn't know ups and
downs and she made it yeah we're still
trying to kill Jason hopefully you know
we're trying we're trying to go
but I could be wrong okay Fletch that
part of our group Jason is not by the
drive-through I have to escape around
here oh you're it to me let's get it
let's gather at the main fucking cabin
if you're close
gasps bring the gas by if I can find out
where I am
oh shit the batteries in here too
the gas the battery and the phone are
all in the same house just putting that
out there
randomization is weird
yep Tommy Jarvis is called the fuck am I
now
all right we're gathering yeah oh I see
that's captain
I need to I need to I need a weapon
actually people saying with gas at the
moment
nice
okay we need a melee weapon now yes
hello I used to my Michael always bang
on sure I need a weapon I need a weapon
there's a flare gun over here this
battery I need a weapon
alright let's see what we can do here
did shoot him in the face once I feel
good about that okay well that's good
oh I got his mask up I got his mask off
already
okay probably just went to trap the
house that's the the shack nope he's
here
really
he's killing someone he just killed
someone
i I'm heading this way to find a weapon
or I'm useless I don't have a map I
couldn't tell you without I have a map
it's on the west
it's in the West yeah yeah he's outside
my house I've got a wrench are you guys
had mama way to go system
what's he doing out there
what pussy fucking pussy
what the fuck he knew we had he knew
what was going on fucking was okay but
by the way I had his mask off in two
hits because of my pic oh yeah I also
hit him with a shotgun and I have high
strengths between the two I had the the
more people I'm around the stronger I oh
yeah that's a good perk for him
and we were in a giant group and we got
his mask off so I like we got to go one
more we can't leave it on that right
yeah shit we were there again
dickheads right here's here's the flam
once we get Jason's mask off we have the
sweater we have Tommy Jarvis somebody L
no no no I'm not ready yet while we're
doing the kill so Jason doesn't rage
quit he'll think we fucked something up
no no no I don't have a machete know at
least that quitter was publicly shamed
that's right that's right
true that's the point play your part
your role is the bad guy
all right I gotta get out of here
No
I'm near people I don't know if that
people is you you and Camp Hill Brooke
yes me an inset flow pathetic alright
I'm in this other house here I'm gonna
look for a weapon and whatnot and we'll
meet up
you're already behind me insect
I'm not find a weapon lying around it
really really
careful jackets guys good Jason at one
time yep did you hear see where you are
yep I know I know but you know what you
guys were around I had to have that perk
I got a couple good hits in to ballsy oh
sorry daddy scream that you tried to
join us but too many glitches on your
and then unfortunately hits got some
bugs
since they're looking at sometimes a
dead body
Chad Connie who's Chad just drops like a
flare gun then went back for a wrench
and dropped it near the car
like his dropping weapons near that
smart that's smart
yeah that's okay here's what happens
it's a good threat all right why don't
you you're trying to go with the car
right yeah you know you're gonna have to
come back to the car but guess what's
gonna happen you won't have any weapon
you'll have to drop your weapon to pick
up the gas all right that's fair second
time he stole was both early same guy
yeah wasn't by the phone that time he
might be he might be trying to snipe
ashore yep look at Chad here hiding
yeah it's are we done oh yeah after this
we're done but but hey we gave it the
old we gave it a valiant effort yeah we
should have had that I'm so pissed that
I rage quit that was it that was it we
had a lot of good mojo right there a lot
of good mojo as mass goes off everyone
was alive oh yeah and we were all on the
same page
are you trying to do are you trying to
fix it picked up the trap instead of the
shotgun
oh no the humanity you're looking at
nothing come on you guys missed that it
was hilarious well given the glitches I
don't think you can assume he ragequit
there's a chance he just got
disconnected to shoot what he was
getting his ass kicked he was getting
his fucking ass kicked that's the the
thing is Oh perfect perfect mediocre oh
look at that I like how we're both
screaming here wait I'll spin the other
way hey here we go slower sorry there we
go
and ya see that's the thing is is he
seemed to be alright it could have just
been a random kick but we were all so we
were kicking his ass that that had all
the symptoms of Rage gwendy he just got
he got his mask off they just got
stunned three times in a row that was
some I'm pissed and a big group of
people he could clearly see we were all
working together and then he didn't yeah
he didn't want to be the Jason that got
killed it's too late for that to go on
the reveal
what we tell you know that all that
footage that's a live it up footage to
go end of the spinning the glitches
we're talking about oh I have so much
glitch footage that's one one no no no
and we talked about this in the review
about the player base being the problem
and Jason's being assholes and and and
and Jason's at least supposed to be an
asshole right councilors turning against
new counselors working with Jason
counselors glitching up onto a rough
word they can't be killed
there's lots of player based problems
this game seems like it's better than
the sum of its parts yes yes despite all
of these glitches and everything and
despite the player base occasionally
being dicks no I enjoy this game quite a
bit oh man you hit those moments and
that's our conclusion that's our
conclusion is the moments like it like
that moments with necro like just the
lone survivor doesn't really know what
she's doing just kind of fumbling around
and still manages to get over a complete
idiot doesn't know what they're doing I
said doesn't really know how okay new
relative a new player right and end it
like I'm sure for her it was really
tense like oh my god I know people are
watching me I'm driving I'm fumbling
around and it's those cinematic moments
that happen naturally
unlike the like look at this guy just
hiding in houses Connie
instead of instead of the game
developers putting us in a tube and
saying this is the moment that needs to
happen here they were just setting up
the pieces for us and they they often
fall perfectly where that we have those
cinematic moments like Connie over oh
look at that look at Connie just in fear
you can do it you got another pocket
knife nope oh right now captain Muller
you're all that's left captain Muller
flicking his light on and off see if we
have any fun I was like those views see
if we can see Jason walking around
as or captain Muller is hiding if you
can't kill Jason with a bunch of paid
Stooges doing your every command how are
we supposed to believe that you're at
you've ever killed him well I haven't
I've never killed him yeah I don't
either I don't even paid Stooges I
that's fine to say euphemism for you
know people who are in on the bit and
that's the way that's not paid Stooges
that's how you have to kill Jason you
need to use teamwork yeah we did was get
a team together right
I've been in two games where it's
happened okay once was the one where we
were making progress towards doing it
and then the Jason just decided that
doesn't count now doesn't count I didn't
feel like a kind of peel and then the
other time I was just getting the car
together and all of a sudden was fuckin
cutscene Stern's
but what said happen it happened just
away from me sure it hadn't you had
nothing to do had nothing to do with it
sure no and you know I came really close
to one we were in adjacent Hill and I
was Tommy Jarvis and we had the girl had
the sweater and I didn't know what to do
though
yeah and so like I had heard you mention
it a little bit like oh as time you have
to hit him with the ax or whatnot right
yeah so it was a girl with the sweater
another person and me as Tommy Jarvis
and the girl used your sweater oh yeah
look at that the floating body is still
there so the girl used the sweater and I
thought and so then after the sweater I
hit Jason as Tommy Jarvis and I wasn't
supposed to get the other guy was gonna
hit him first so like it was my mistake
yeah
good game everyone good game Jason I
really like the one from the oven I was
Tony coincidence and you all thought
they were doing it on purpose they're
doing it on purpose doing what to whom
my supply oh that's it that's it yeah we
will I will leave I will leave this
Lobby I will leave our group and we will
call it a night as it is getting rather
late I was gonna head tea and say good
night everyone
oh wait it's done not too late all right
I guess good night everyone I think
we're wrapping it up
good night
it was a heck of an attempt rich it was
I don't know if I'll bring this back on
Sunday but I might bring it back on
Sunday it is a big pain in the butt for
me to disconnect everything and bring it
here but it might be worth I want to try
again all right I want to I want to
fucking do it all right if you listen if
you're if you're watching us now on

microphone so not only did I hear the
creepy music but an all-star started
slowly getting louder and louder and I
have the footage of it like I have the
footage of it but I've decided not to
put it in the episode because the
