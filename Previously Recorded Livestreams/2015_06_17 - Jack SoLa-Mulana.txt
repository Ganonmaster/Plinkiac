looking for la moulana right then ruins
can be reached down by the outskirts of
this village your father went in there
to do his research but he had been back
for some days now I ain't got a clue to
what he's after but since ancient times
folks have been passing rumors down
about the secret treasures heck even the
origin of life itself may be hiding
inside these Rubens generation after
generation we've protected la mulana
even soul I don't really know what her
secrets are get out of town jack what I
won't stop you from entering the ruins
but mind you the mysterious the
mysteries of la-mulana are unsolved
because those who go in don't come back
out dead or alive who knows what happens
to you what system is the Sun it son
steam I got a through steam steam sale

entrance take a weight with you too by

you jump up your kind of trapped in the
up and if you jump art to kind of sneaky
o Allah Moana oh oh and I just didn't

malady when you saw mr. Sulu run oh

learning the game and i know it's
frustrating for some people but you know
p

that almost looks like something but I
just think it's a cloud
how
it's like it's upsetting you know mario
has taught me that you can jump off of
certain things like I should be able to
read that right
