I am moving so that's promising sign
all right over here now that was that
was a fret that was a bit was a crash I
could not get it to come back what's up
what's up what a night we're gonna get
cut off where did I get cut off well
what I was saying this I just noticed
it's 12 miles later than 12:30 it's
closing in on one
I didn't plan this but it's working out
that way I think we're gonna call this a
no death run so I'm going to play this
game until either I die I win or I just
get too tired cuz I know if we're that
close to the end
oh we're an excuse me so we're just
gonna we're just keep on going my
computer didn't crash OBS the thing that
does the streaming that crashed the
computer's fine the thing that does the
stream in that program my streaming
program crashed why am i up so late I'm
at night all this is midnight for me is
the night is young
until I died don't I die all the time in
this game I haven't have you been paying
attention I even died once and I'll bet
you there's someone out there who has
not died playing blood-borne I'll bet ya
it's happened
the argent tower is destroyed the portal
can no longer be closed from this side
the hell energy flows from a location in
their world we call the well to walk
between dimensions the line from the
trailer that's the line Vega is trying
to access Olivia's files if you can get
to the nearest terminal we will provide
you with information
second there for a second there when I
did that glory kill i clenched my my
everything because I thought oh no I did
that over the gap I'm gonna fall to my
death as soon as the glory kills over
and then I couldn't see that where the
ground was it was looking at the sky for
a second after it was done I was like oh
shit but no we're good we're good
no I'm a fucking platforming if I die I
want it to be in battle like a man oh
wait I got to do this thing first
yeah well so better way up there
all right I can't let myself get too
nervous
where's the thing is the other thing set
up there
like like my setups a little bit
different than it is at home so you
notice anytime before I do any kind of
platforming I double check to make sure
I've got my finger on the right jump
button because like my setups a little
bit different than it is at home I'm
using a different Mouse
hi jack is Jack in the stream I've heard
very little from Jack since he's been on
vacation which I assume means he's
having a lot of fun jack is in the
stream
he's in the chat hello jack
we have we have water slap
Oh every time I hate it
I just waited no return but I think I
think that's all the things I need to
get
all right how am i doing on my upgrades
14 I need nine for the Shamian
really what are the pistol upgrades
but what are my challenges here Keller
Evan at MIT er kill five demons with the
chainsaw alright that means I'm gonna
need chainsaw ammo or fuel I guess the
chainsaw doesn't use ammo
that's full that's full there's a Brede
thing
oh do I get a collect do I gotta collect
Reedy things to qui our three data logs
yes I do know I need one more I know
this don't that be a door opening switch
here here we go
Olivia has an artifact in her private
lab that we've been studying for years I
believe you can use it to find the
answers you see
you can access our Lazarus facility from
the north sector of the advanced
research complex about 80 kilometers
away
I'll bring the tram power online to take
you there the Salukis clearance card to
activate it there is a security station
nearby
waste
up in the air probably not gonna do from
there
jump jump dude flying attack thing and
then you want to come on I need to kill
you in the air are you frozen are you
stuck
he's stuck
do your flying charge attack so I can
kill you what there you go
challenge complete
all right
damnit
all right and he helped back here a
little bit brutal a little bit
No
but if you get shot gun shows
five little armored points
and I keep forgetting to use my items
yeah well it's fine you know that's all
fine
whoo
that
like mobility in yeah lame collect the
held relics alright
nope by the way I'm not counting death
during these challenges things that's
not a proper death
they don't even like a nightmare
difficulty which I'm not playing right
now where you can't die at all those
don't even count so that doesn't count
we're still good it's a challenge mode
thing nope
or not kind of time
look
no no no it's not even a good rune I all
kind of platforming death in the regular
game this is this is a room challenge
which I am counting is something
different like when you play the games
official no death mode which is
nightmare difficulty it doesn't count
these deaths I missed the thing again I
mean if I were going to count these I
wouldn't even try the rooms if that were
a thing if I were going to count this as
a death Richard Wow what what do you
want me you say my name for a while but
formally it in long form why why
myself time my stall time
barely
oh we got that rude I'm not gonna use I
might have opened the last room slot
though
do I get anything from live twitch views
yeah I get live twitch views I get
something for tips send subs I don't
know whatever just you don't have to do
any of that you just watch and that's
enough not holding holding anybody
anybody's wallet hostage
oh come on where is everybody
they're powering up this best part
oh come on
Oh what's up
so many secrets in this whole area
almost knock me off
nothing
nothing up here all right
I don't die here
I'm not taking risky jumps for no reason
and I remember where all the stuff went
where's everything I need to do need to
get over there I'm not jumping that way
and get down there right
we're just having one fight right yeah
there you are
I'll write my face now chew him shit
that was not fun that was not fun
that's the way up there I don't remember
what it is
now wait it's not a thing like
employment or someone we came from Oh
God
I don't remember where I need to go for
the secret stuff
wait is it here no that's right it's
just where I came from right here
oh it might be experiencing fatigue
it's a way across here and I'm not
jumping over this gap
all right found where I need to be
all right
here Thanks
oh god it's down here somewhere I got a
jump over the rail railing No
I only live once
okay there's so much ah all right we're
good we're good Oh live stream damn you
rich Evans I am
nope nope
whoo
something still alive that was weird
that was weird
your keycard the tram station lost
weight too much armor right there mmm
I had the mega-haul if I had 200 armor I
got 112 bites
nope nope you get out of there you fuck
no more imps
a lot of things
alright we're ready for this
bastard
yeah you creep
god I hate the Cacodemons in this game
nope
playing like craps what I'm doing but
good enough crap but good enough is it a
thing
Oh God
him
they are
whoo
it didn't feel pretty but I'm alive
you know security sweep
we know all right
all right
you sneaky bitch
this is what I want
this room and one other are the keys the
keys
nope get away get away
ship
Wow
that wasn't cool man
don't jump jump doesn't have the jump
button that was the do-nothing button
nope didn't climb fast enough
Oh jump out of the double jump in this
challenge yeah it's a rune trial I'm not
counting room trial deaths
well well oh please
thirty seconds where is it perhaps me
and you big boy
whoo
where is it
nut clenching jumps I hate him
dumbass go I was placed
I already shoot his eye out
nice
you cannot send a team in to retrieve it
I am the head of this corporation all
your work and discoveries here belong to
me it was mine before you even found him
all right are we doing on this shit full
phone
Marchant so I want oh I hope I can get
back I hope I can get back that's an
important woman I don't know that I can
I think I'm fucked no I can't oh thank
god
every time I hate it every single time I
hate it
all right there all right what do I jump
from here oh god I hope I jump from here
all right
Oh
really
that kills oh shit I forgot about that
all right
I can't neglect that the trap is now
ready to depart the youth a C's advanced
research complex will be our destination
why the late stream because I have not
died
I just keep living
we're going to lad I win or get too
tired
hurt me plenty is the difficulty it's no
death right now an unexpected one
well sale this goes I know there's a I
got stuck here once there's a glitch i
might get a softlock
where am I one of my things I got to do
interact with two rooms find two
collectibles and five screw-top kills on
possessed all those are fun
this vast state-of-the-art research
design
go on here huh okay all right
almost Lube
I know I needed to screw chopping but I
also needed to get my chain gun mastery
nope not that
that waiter no stop doing the wrong
attack behind you can't get it up one
more
oh wait okay there's nothing without
believers we cannot conduct our work
without them and what kind of work is it
that you're doing Olivia I haven't seen
a report from your team in months now
hello can I trust that you can maintain
your distance and control of the
situation of course I believe in our
work
this isn't progress it's madness the
board understands the peculiar nature of
your work and no one is in the dark on
what those sacrifices mean to mankind
but your judgement is no longer
considered sound
all right hey
only doing on a room stuff perform six
different buffs Wow
30 equipped items
you know I like it old
Oh
was a disappointing for circa
yes
should have saved that berserker power
up till a bit later in that battle when
I got heated up but I did not I did not
I'm really terrible at solo Streatley
that's the commentary god no I could
have done better but I didn't I'm so
stupid I could have done the thing but I
didn't do the thing I'm not gonna talk
for another 15 minutes now I walk around
the game
do not be alarmed by the system update
it is a prototype of our
interdimensional tether a means for me
to pull you back from hell I'm sorry for
that short but I didn't think you'd
allow its installation voluntarily
I'm dr. Samuel Haines I have supplies in
my office this way all right all right
we'll go this way mr. robot man that is
your real name mr. robot man oh good
because I started taking them before you
offered Hey
so cool right yeah there's my statue
world is derived from the inscriptions
of a large stone artifact we pulled from
hell
in the earliest days of the program we
call it the helix stone it is our most
closely guarded asset
Olivia was obsessed with it from it we
learned how to manipulate hell's energy
they needed to power we'll take
advantage of their resources it also led
us to you Bailey stone showed us a
harvest
Deep Space nine worth watching you've
only seen Voyager and TNG oh my God if
wagers awful Deep Space nine is good
it's it's very different from what
you're used to in Trek it's darker it's
a little bit different somatically but
it's quality Voyager is crap TNG is like
some of the best Star Trek ever though
really the original series isn't bad you
shouldn't just rule that out the service
elevator Kirk Spock and McCoy are some
good characters as much as I love TNG I
really do appreciate Kirk Spock and
McCoy
the joy of beating a demon his own
fucking arm cannot be understated
there's some missing something in there
another room down here
is in there
alright alright
almost got activated chili
fucking face
yeah
rock
all right oh pretty low on ammo that's
not good
and uh we got some platforming coming up
that's not good
okay what if I pull those no deathrun
off next time I play doom on stream
it'll be a higher difficulty this is
normal this isn't easy and I'm going to
die or get tired I don't think I'm gonna
finish this tonight
it's already 2 Oh what I got to do I
just kill everything
where are the things I can't move it's
only are you gonna make me wait out the
minute you stupid demon
it's trolling me
it's fucking trolling me look at it
the game is trolling me
this is bullshit
do you want to come and try and kill me
so I
I
let's get elevated
that's more fucking like it what fuels
not bad
is there any particular reason I dislike
the wall I wouldn't say I dislike the
wall I would say I don't like the wall
if you're talking about Pink Floyd's the
wall anywhere near as much as I like
Dark Side of the Moon there's a lot of
songs in the wall that just if they're
all right - I don't really care for them
that much with like one exception I'm
not that big on on the run I love
everything on dark side of the movie the
wall you got like the main theme they
keep repeating dun dun duh dun duh dun
duh that's great a lot of other things
in them I kind of like
so it's the difference between I like
almost all of the things on the album
and I like some of the things on the
elbow
all right
platforming oh I hate it
I hate it
all right now where to
where is it in else here
there you are trying to sneak up behind
me dick
first things first don't fall on my
ridiculous death
shit
but it's worth getting up there
I know this way up I know there is
I think I got to go up over there it's
not worth it
that all risk for the arson itself
I should've gone with armor but the ammo
I gotta do this no we don't do this
again
this is secret up there fuck it fuck it
I'm not I'm not going to fuck it I
already missed one secret earlier I
missed once you get the whole game it's
gonna be at least two now
there it's too late it can't go back
what's done is done miss the thing
I have now granted myself license to
skip every other secret
I want to Amy
secret I'm neglecting him there
this is just this
I know there's something around here
somewhere
how's it down here
yeah whoa all right
how are we doing on our weapon upgrades
I got ten
there we go
guess it just goes in the same pocket
all this guns going
which I'm not which this there's a good
chance this is where the stream ends by
the way
oh fuck this
nope nothin no what killed me was the
jump button remember I said every time I
was gonna make a jump I made sure I hit
the right button because I'm using a
different mouse the the buttons are laid
out of it differently I hit the wrong
button for jump I hit the wrong button
for jump as a fine stream stupid killed
me yeah stupid killed me as a good run
there's a good run try it again I'm
gonna try it again sometime I'm not
gonna say soon but I'm gonna try that
again that's fun I'll probably start
earlier
oh my god here alright um catch up on
tips yeah
got to reload the the tip program
because it's not working right
sorry chances okay I think y'all rubbed
off on me
