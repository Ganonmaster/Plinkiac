all the arrows oh how did an arrow
gateway the fuck up here I figured Rizzy
where's Lee I got him where is it you
shoot arrows we didn't know you won
I think Janne
I mean it's not horrible it sounds like
scratchy your game audio such as weird
yeah
would you turn off I could you know what
I could turn the game audio down
oh my go to options here music is at an
AIDS yeah it's weird it sounds like an
old recording like playing on a record
or something very bizarre here I turn
the game music down in the actual game
and it's not the worst sure I think
people complained about it you know they
can live with it
sure okay so now we have to be two
different people
let's see here I'm sure each person has
know so here you go Joey yeah alright I
reveal a senora okay okay
section two oh I was just gonna
well since it's not the game what it is
but if we sound fine I just heard it
okay okay I don't know we that's the
really the thing you know the actual
output is being overloaded I don't
understand these these things the
technical terms of beyond me oh don't
forget about that trigger button it's
like a dad for me beer pong I did you
can live with it well I'm sorry to hear
them can't live with it
some beer beer corn says that he doesn't
think he can I don't know how that was
oh my god I fucking okay yeah okay I'm
okay you get it just hang out over here
something I hit your fire yeah I know I

or six okay okay watch I again sure
we're doing fuse different characters
yeah try again
Arnold's is there any other than visuals
is there any difference
the levels are character highway I think
they're the same that's wrong any quotes
my girls equation oh you fuck that was
that was luck
let's gonna say accident but no luck
we're gonna call that luck
oh by the way if I jump on you I steal
your arrows oh so haha doesn't it that's

something I learned
my hair my hair got stuck to the ceiling
I'm arrows shit
shit look at that's awesome
shit shit shit I'm out of shit come on
oh you fuck what you do you sure the
bomb didn't get you
I was a volume back oh maybe I think it
was an arrow could have been about Matt
to the corner that's weird
do you like yeah I think he had some era
before
this is a new wish game right I think so
how common is it in indie games to
replicate the look of these 30 90s be
pretty common because picking maybes go
on yeah it's it's a it is a recent trend
okay I'll go say is everybody sick of it
some people are I could play games like
this correctly okay yeah I mean you know
there's gonna be a backlash eventually
well yeah cuz I can't speak about video
games specifically of course but in
general I think I'm I'm sick of mush I
think I'm sick of people replicating
stuff from the 80s and early 90s it's
one of those things where when it's done
Oh get outta here oh god Mike yeah
bomb bomb night it's uh you know when
it's done well my children
oh mighty while you didn't you kill me
you bombed that crew oh my god well
water what oh my god this is
disorienting me this is disgusting and
awful actually yeah this is making me a
little sick um something like
oh my god oh yeah something like like
the shovel knight yeah
that is such a perfect shamash I see
that yeah why have all your arrows
where are you or are you just I'm dead
oh my method I got ad I thought I was
out of lives I didn't give one more one
more
um when it's done right I can finish my
theis we're lucky no one gave my
everything
um it's it's one of those things where
it's worth it hey we did look something
like this doesn't necessarily need it
pixel art style okay but it it looks
pretty pixel art doesn't hurt it you
know Jerry there I'm trying to think of
an example of a game that has pixel art
just for the I mean
just for the sake of it I'm just curious
cuz I think of like with movies like if
I see another movie with the grindhouse
film great filter like that's so sick of
it yeah or like replicating you know
like eighties slasher movies and things
like that or I'm just I want to see
something new like that's the movies
I've seen lately that I really liked
have been movies that are trying
different things trying new things yeah
I'm just sick of everybody trying to
replicate the past yeah this is coming
from someone who made a movie that's an
homage to Robert Oakland also movies
from the 80s I've been through that
phase but I'm sick of it right this is a
pre-clear somebody could use the people
this is not a key this is not a game
no this reminds me what mary-rose
the the original yeah that's a marvel
yeah
virus yes I agree with you angry no this
isn't this is interesting this is neat
and interesting I can't uh I mean I
don't know how much how many thanks but
this is fun this is a nice arcade
experience
oh fuck you I landed on your head
you that's that's the noise I make I
like it I like it I I condone that noise
yeah mine what was that dude what is do
I don't know what what come here
everything
it doesn't kind of beauty okay
like Elvis I killed them n boss in one
turn everyone is wrong about so maybe
that's what it does
how am I did take shit shit Harris
ah fuck maybe I was out arrows Estrella
Estrella yeah no I cannot but I can play
this for a lot is right up your alley
yeah this is this is right in my
hometown Jack how close are we to leave
unlock new in Moby Collins uh we just
got there actually oh we just got there
with two more I think and so we we know
we're gonna get a jeez I'm a man jeez um
that one we're gonna get for sure I'm
gonna hit that Jesus face okay because
it's funny and I do wonder if they're
gonna if they're gonna yell at me
because he's a celebrity
Jesus yeah remember I tried to get um
try to get that producers face Oh with
Nicole Rick McCallum and they denied it
because Liam is delivering and so I
wonder I wonder if they're gonna turn
down Jesus that would actually be really
funny I'm under a couple people earlier
look signal suggesting a Juggalo Jay I
mean that seems a little tune jiggle are
you gigolo the problem is there's too
many
Juggalo day pictures to choose from
mm-hm and so it's like how I choose well
I mean if you if you go you know if you
just look up you know any previous
gathering of the Juggalos yeah there's
pictures of me all over the place
Hrothgar year I do different makeup
so you know people you know we went to
gigolo Jay victims yeah yeah well oh
this is revenge I did sue the Insane
Clown Posse at the mall once what they
were in town I guess they had a show
either that night of the night before
and I was walking near the mall and they
were walking a little ways ahead of me
and and these these two girls came up to
me and they go oh gee no that's the
Insane Clown Posse I don't know why they
came up to me it was like okay no I can
you go ask them if it's actually them
like no I'm not gonna ask me that
because I don't care and I'm here to buy
a teapot and then I walked away I'm
sorry you were there to buy tea pot yeah
then can buy a tea pot I needed one of
all T Kappa servers I needed a tea oh
that's that's more manly absolute um but
yeah I don't know what they liked they
didn't want to approach him himself so
they came to me because I guess I was a
little bit older so they thought it
would be more you're able to approach
them easier but so I did see that that's
the closest I ever got to meeting my
idols Paul when I was there by Tikal
sure
the time ezpz wanted to team Z oh shit
hey
you can shave the timer you incidentally
murdering your quad amigo
yes I was haha I might explain why they
came up there like oh there's another
juggle your karma Cup which had nothing
to do with the Juggalos I forgot I was
wearing my like pom makeup in my hatchet
man tattoo was very visible you did my I
suck that round oh I felt good about oh
this isn't yeah very Mario Brothers this
is this is what arcade games used to be
quarters suckers every death is a
quarter man time we got ten thirty have
your guns
I kind of like this shadowy person I
think yeah these are just like different
yeah yes we're checking out I think so
pink pink funk
oh man we've unlocked everything oh
Jesus Christ
flight
shit that's right this doesn't kill you
I keep forgetting
crows yeah the dance is super bored
jellies gumbo jellies coming for you
jelly I think you get away from oh you
got away from me get that Jimmy get that
jelly strawberry not a will a shit I
just wasted on my error how do you guys
recommend telephone uh yeah so far you
know what I don't know what price it is
someone someone looking for how much it
is and then I'll tell you if I recommend
it oh fuck shoot me shoot not ghost
Oh go was i coming okay hey good job
hmmm ghosts I'm afraid yeah I'll take
this when I take it out or or kill me
I guess that's an option too one person
says 499 what a person says one night
either of those prices is worthless
there they're both acceptable okay
oh and then another person says 199 that
is not what man
that person is oh shit oh they black
down
and then someone says 15 bucks
absolutely what if you make up your so
what and we look it up just probably a
sale price I mean there's always I mean
it will say the brain on sale price is
$15 oh no no okay
Bieber 10 10 10 above max horrible okay
10 or below you know what
solidly a gerbil I know how much people
say are saying it is $30.99 it's pushin
it okay let's push it it's you know it's
been done how much you like this game's
pricing out games is a really weird
thing
Oh wings oh is that what these things
are
oh that's crazy helpful I've been
wondering what these fuckers were Kid
Icarus Icarus River
Icarus I've never heard anyone say yeah
I met singer Chris Wright me
oh yeah this would be like yeah less I
died I mean hey and your corn I would
like to do more quick cuts because I've
actually seen a lot of really good
movies like we just have an ad new time
maybe a lot of these days maybe one I
have seen oh I feel like it's weird
usually I see two or three really really
good movies in a year and then lots of
mediocre stop or like it's good see what
a really good stuff this year oh that's
good yeah that should make you feel
happy not consider you sure it doesn't
you feel happy I just wish I were to
talk about what happened if you shoot
the arrow straight up in the air you can
come back then okay oh I was doing great
and as you can see that being a problem
yeah I shot my arrow and I thought to
myself oh I'll catch it and get it back
no I'm all wasted no it went into your
skull I think you can catch it if you
press the M yeah - yeah - but IRA
thought I remembered reading oh fuck
that fuck dad
I'm going to look up with the actual
stain precipices do we have a consensus
that fortunately it seems to be 1499
which like I'm not a gamer person but
I'm looking at this game and that seems
like a bit you know it's it's time it's
really tough to price these things out
well someone's asking if I've seen a
repo man with Emilio Estevez that's how
we started that reading tonight I mended
a beggar at the very beginning but that
was one of the very first things we
talked about Rico man what did we think
about did he say about it you were doing
the Smash Mouth song help recover and
how it looked like an homage Torito
that's correct
goddamn Harry Dean Stan was so great
measuring everything against so goodness
was he great the Avengers oh yeah yeah
he was because he was in it because it
was him yes I got wings you're killed no

he ever would but has Tarantino directed
anything that he didn't also write also
only he I mean uh uh Jackie Brown is
based on a book yeah but like this
creeper right yeah
though he has never directed at another
person script okay has he done anything
close to sci-fi even remotely resembling
no no but like also like he's he's an at
or like it's his movie from but yeah he
comes up with the scripts he knows
exactly how he wants to be amazing
that's aspect so I wonder I actually
wonder what it would be like him just
directing someone else's thing
no I I don't think it ever happens no it
doesn't really matter he has food ok
ready ready ruining sony in the chatter

no I mean I I like him a lot but he has
a very specific style yeah I can't
imagine it lending itself to something
science fiction I got somebody okay yeah

great impression okay

on track No you'll get that wondering oh
yes we're gonna get that fucker we're
gonna get good this is fun this is a fun
game so you know it you know the the
real thing about like recommending this
game is split the cost with the print
well there you go oh shit then it's
definitely worth it
a game to play with a friend if jelly
and remember to jump on them jellies go
high ground gotta get that high ground
and jump up and jump on top and high
ground before you do it yeah boys people
are quoting you know but what is a
casual that someone to displace games
they don't play the right kind of like
people who play like jewel quest on
Facebook you know oh okay like if like
my mom playing playing farmville yesyes
casual yes
it's meant as an insult to a real gamer
okay but it's all fucking bullshit
anyone whose main hobby is playing games
is a gamer and if that's fucking
farmville and that's fucking farm now
you know only real gamers please five

second thing that's popped up where it's
only a question with my name we talked

involved with them too but he wasn't one
of the original Rhino um either order
five or six heal everybody worked for

in Australia I'll split pea Oh split
ation yes that's a real thing
yeah why and why were they exploiting
Australia and they weren't explain
anything it was just there was movies
made in Australia at that time this 70s
I think it was but it was just lots of
crazy stunts and it was just a crazy
time okay crazy crate it was the it was
the crazy town and you were the mayor
there's a schism in your film called
stunt rock which combines rock and roll
with stumps there's a band
all's name of the band in the movie I
think it's called are the Wizards I
can't remember but it's just cutting
back and forth between them playing and
then a guy doing stunts yeah that stuff
good we're gonna do it we did it with it
with in it hey that was it you know that
was solid - yeah yeah play after dad owe
me some day you think oxonium would be
more exciting than this
this is tension after that could be fun
what is that you played afternoon - play
don't look spoke oh okay oh okay
okay is there a game based on Octomom
it's other than the name pon that's all
the only thing to come you're an octopus
posing as a human father they don't
explain where the kids came from but he
asked kids okay and it's secret that
he's an activist maybe nobody knows but
also he's clearly an octopus okay

for a second

fire fly I'm from Japan

sounded by the way don't we have the
power
next reply do not jump on the vanishing
point oz mic aside from stun rock
the only other Brian preference yeah
gypsy why you shut my shield did I yeah
the only Brian trenchard-smith movies
I've seen her is American one which is
leprechaun three and that little demons
too so I don't think I'm gonna get
enough place to judge in the region what
you blew me up
well you should move in there coolly up
why why'd you pull me up me shit in a
business-like do that I was there right
did you do that because apparently you
blow up when you wake up and I do not
know this hey you owe me yeah alright
you know true - true dat who dat true
dat there's one thing
I do a junkie oh yes leprechaun three is
to one of the casinos in Las Vegas oh we
did leprechaun poor in space too and
that one's great there's a leprechaun
four yes there's oh are you kidding me
that's there's leprechaun four and then
after that there's leprechaun in the
hood and then after that there's
leprechaun back to the hood shut up and
now WWE just produce leper found origins
which is the gritty serious reboot of
the leprechaun series that can't be true
which I have no interest in seeing no
the only reason to see any of those
movies is for Warwick Davis for God this
he's great
a leprechaun for was pretty funny does
he still but he still plays all the left
round no no the new one is because it
was produced by WWE
so leprechaun is played by a Hornswoggle
it was apparently a little person
wrestler oh okay
which is like why see it's not Warwick
Davis right
