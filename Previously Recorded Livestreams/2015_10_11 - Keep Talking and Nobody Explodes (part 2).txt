okay already I know I somehow survived I
can do this okay let's go wait oh shit
it's all on order now why is it all on
to order now yeah
what why would night we have regular
wires regular wires okay how many five
is the last wire black no there's no
black wires red wires one red wire if
there's exactly one red wire and there
is more than one yellow wire yes there's
two white two yellow wires cut the first
wire all right I got the fancy new wires
the fancy new wires well we know I have
that one okay okay within this module
there are several panels with wires on
them but only one panel is visible at a
time switch the next panel by using the
down button
okay what do you have one going in to
see and it's red wire to going into a
and it's blue so the the first wire is
going in to see ya number yeah first
wire is going in to see cut okay blue
wire blue wires to going into a second
occurrence going into a or C cup
no it's in the second module is a and
we're going on to the next news oh
there's there's there's there's three at
a time are we only cutting like one of
these I'm in the second set I'm in four
five and six right now you're in four
five and six yeah
okay so what do you have for two a and
it's red five to be and I think it was
black my lights went out and then six
into see it's red wait so red to red
wires eight four two eight four two a
cut for a cut nope
five to be and six to see what's going
on red okay we got to get these new
waters we gotta get these in two wires
down because I don't know what's going
this is complicated
yeah well I'm sure it's the point okay
within this module there are several
panels with wires on them but only one
oh I did you start again yeah son of a
bitch okay we have the wires with the
LEDs and the stars oh my god I can't
okay okay what do I need what do you
need for me to go read this read the
instructions we got time we got five for
lower half minutes look at each wire
there's an LED above the wire and a
space for a star symbol below the wire
for each wire LED symbol combination use
the Venn diagram below to decide whether
or not to cut the wires okay first wire
yes is red no LED but there is a star
okay it's red yeah no LED but there is a
star oh there is a star yes
okay so we have red okay okay okay okay
I think I see this so here's red has a
star is this one red has a star and
that's B how many batteries three cut
okay okay
second wire is blue and red okay no LED
there is a star there is a star yes but
no light but no light yes
cut all right
blue and red yep LED is on no star oh it
is on
no star no star what's the last digit of
the serial number two don't wait cut the
wire if the yeah cut okay the next one
there the next wire blue light but no
LED blue yeah there's a light there's no
LED for the fourth while
wait there's a light or the star there's
no star there is light there is an LED
yes
yes it's blue LED cut white red stripe
LED no star
cut okay three regular wires two white
and one black regular wires three
regular wires yep
what is the last way or white yes cut
the last word
no two white one black
if the last wire is white cut the last
wires what it says is I didn't Oh
two white one black yes cut the last
wire that didn't work
two white and one black yes with three
wires yes second wire second wild all
right there we go
memory memory with the four buttons all
right first digit is one second position
for second position for remember notes
okay three four three button in the
first position first position three okay
one same label as you pressed in stage
two three three and there was a fourth
position
okay four four is a press the button in
the same position as you press in stage
two which was position one okay four
press the button with the same label as
you pet pressed in stage three which is
four
no it wasn't we're starting over for
fourth position of three all right okay
to same position as you press in stage 1
2 is also 2 2 2 okay for four to three
it's three three yeah button in the
third position third position is three
okay and I blew up time
almost I have my notes I don't what
happened
I'm type we rather no I'm saying what
happened was it with house messing it up
I don't know it's okay
yeah we had this done we totally got it
this time the one true Morty police
chief asks what makes you sure you're
qualified for the bomb squad Jack and I
said I went to Clown College all right
new fancy wires let's get this one on
the fucking way new fancy wires blue no
LED no star blue no one no no and no and
it's just just a blue wire so that is P
cut the wire if the bomb has a parallel
port you know the parallel port looks
like parallel port is just circles no
dashes and it's long I don't see any
ports okay so don't cut the wire don't
get the wire okay red and white no no
red and white no LED nope no no sorry
they're a no star so red and white no ID
so that is what's the last digit of the
serial number five don't cut don't cut
all right blue and red LED and star so
blue would write both around Blue Moon
red has an LED and a star and a star do
not cut the wire white yeah no LED and a
star has a star but no led everyone
white you're white wait it has a star
yes no LED
cut the way I'm real good
regular wires regular wise okay okay to
blue to yellow for four wires to blue to
yellow is the last wire yellow yes and
there are no Reds no cut the first wire
all right good simons this okay I'm
waiting for it flash waiting for it
flash green the weight of a serial
number contain a vowel yes yes okay
flash green then you press the yellow
yellow all right
green green yellow yellow yep green
green blue yellow yellow red
green green blue yellow yellow yellow
red green yeah no strikes two minutes
thirty seconds left
damn that's a much better high-five that
F okay you know I could be up and down I
think works a lot better try um manually
honored you want try it defusing I'll
try defusing alright I can't I just
can't
no that's you don't need that stuff
that's like the cover oh oh that felt
good
if I'll get having to win yeah totally
no wait till you see that new wire thing
it is true it's like a it's like a Venn
diagram the wire thing is the weirdest
cuz it's a Venn diagram hopefully um if
someone sharing the bomb defusal manual
so you guys can follow along how do you
do you can easily find it yourself at
bomb Manuel calm bomb Manuel calm it is
in sane it's insane it's you Usain Bolt
by Morse code yeah okay okay
had method something okay one giant leap
oh my god
sixty percent of the time this bomb
explodes every time that's funny that's
got joke now that has a reference that
is a reference to it I wouldn't call
that a joke
oh my god yeah this is crazy isn't that
crazy
okay ready four modules
five minutes okay are you ready no but
yes it's starting all right what do we
got first starting we don't have
anything right now
well yeah I could tell that snooze goes
off I'm throwing it okay we have the
words with the six panels all right
let's first work okay okay a why okay
the top right top right is right yes no
nothing the word nothing hit next there
a posture they apostrophe re bottom left
bottom left is left
right no left okay next up up up up up
up up up up up yes left middle left
middle is press right no middle what
middle no yes no ready no press done
okay now we have the wire the the wires
with the stars and we have a Venn
diagram yep we have a white wire LED no
star LED no star white wire so none of
cut the wire nope okay let's try that
again
white wire LED on no star LED is on so
that's a circle there's no star there's
no star and there's no color no color
right cuz it's white Oh white yeah
there's the only colors red and blue do
not cut the wire okay so now we have a
blue and white wire a wire with blue on
it no LED with a star
do not cut the wire next okay blue and
white yeah with an LED no start with LED
there's no red what was it
blue and white all right blue with an
LED and no star yep
this is have a parallel port no parallel
port don't cut the wire next okay
white uh-huh no LED no stark white
no LED cutting I didn't work last time
right no no last one had an LED Oh last
one had another idea
oh my god that's my forgot to cut the
wire yep oh we're good okay good next
okay
we have symbols all right what we got
what do we got backwards filled in P oh
my god backwards filled in P you with an
eye in the middle filled in star hold on
hold on
you and I aren't filled in star and
upside down P with the T cross all right
you the nine yep
P yep with the T P with the team okay

Morse code all right let's try it first
okay ready you got dot dot dot dot dot
dot dot dot dash try 3 500 53.5050 k
next okay oh we have the 1 2 3 ABC wires
all right what do we got
what's first okay first wire first wire
is red a 1 red a alright red - a first
occurrence leave it alone next okay
- red B that's also a red yes
cut it's going to be yep cut oh I third
is it's a black wire I know that I have
to wait till the lights come back on ok
it's a black wire see cut okay next

have one the button labeled form that is
first position for okay to the same
label you pressed in stage one which
label was formed look up what column was
in it one first position for now okay
we're for now first possess what's the
what's the big number two button in the
first position is for all right and now
one the button of the same label and
stage 1 which is 4 woo okay next we have
another simple wire we have 1 2 3 4 5
wires is last buyer is black no okay is
there exactly one red wire there's
exactly one red one is there more than
one yellow wire no are there no black
wires there's one black wire cut the
first wire cut the first wire yeah this
is our last module you can see we have
time to think about it
alright um
the last wire is the last wire black no
okay is there exactly one red wire and
more than one yellow there's one red
wire and there's one yellow wire alright
there's not more than one right okay
otherwise if there are no black wires
there's one black water then cut the
first wire cut the first one yes easy
peasy guys we got a time limit we can do
anything we just we buckle under
pressure that's our problem when we can
take our time and read the directions

words and you can up or down change the
letters so so so uh looks like LP and y
AQ oh my god dammit pages are stuck
together Jack okay stuck together from
our sweat we got that we got that we got
plenty of time
alright okay so the possible it's Q L P
and why a those are possible first
possible L possible P okay and why a Q
large does large work I'd it's all the
same I'm on the letters yeah I know but
large is the only one I see with an L
and an a no the second column does not
have an A I thought you said I think you
did the second one no no these are all
the first letters I don't care about the
first ones just go through the go
through all of the first letter cycle
through Oh Pete okay so here's all the
letters that are out right now then I
don't care about just the first one yeah
that's going it up and down yeah that's
what
doing what do you get P yeah and why a Q
I P and P L and a are in there though
no L is not in there sorry oh so there's
there's P a P P and why a Q I all right
second letter go through me
l ya x b cubed V J third Oh Z X L M try
up tray about yep yes we have a white
button that says hold this whole a white
button that says is there a little
indicator with the label C AR there is
no lid indicator with the label ciear is
there more than two batteries yes is
there a lip indicator saying fr cake no
all right hold the button and tell me
what color it is yellow release it when
the countdown timer has a five in any
position got it next we got the wires
with the LEDs and stars we have the Venn
diagram wires we have two minutes left
and this is our last night what you got
first one we have a red wire no LED with
a star no ID has a star at the wire good
next blue and white
no LED no star that's blue all right
what's the last digit of the serial
numbers even or odd odd all right if the
wire if the last digit of the serial
numbers even cut it okay so I'm gonna
leave it yeah okay now we have a white
wire no LED yes star some kind of
amazing how we have better at it well
you know like once once you figure out
like how to describe things I think
that's the biggest heart the biggest
problem is just like what is this manual
even yeah yeah now you do so many times
you're like this is the module let's go
we can I know I this how we solve this
yes can you guys wear something sexy
next time it was literally impossible
for me to wear something sexy you know
I'll do my best I have a couple you know
pretty tight fitting t-shirts but what
we got what do you want how do you undo
this I'll do one more you do one more
okay okay okay
we need a bomb that is all Morse code oh
my god oh fuck off that would kill us
those Morse code one fuck off
i'm i if i can't even tell the
difference from the dots or the bashes i
would be doing yeah i makes me really
lucky that you haven't gotten any other
i got one and we just i think i look it
happened to be the same frequency that
was already on there every weird have I
told you that I lost my clown shoes did
I tell you that during the clown did not
tell me they see that I see the clown
how do you lose Klump shoes they're very
large they're very large end and not
cheap Khan shoes are not cheap
and just in the move you know I haven't
been a clown in years and just moving
from place to place as I have done in
the past and just got lost somewhere I
miss my
Jews they were nice they were nice clown
shoes a small wrinkle something is
different about this bomb and it demands
attention no oh okay I know what this is
gonna be there's gonna be a thing you're
gonna have to keep fiddling with in
order to keep the bomb from exploding
okay ready yeah
look for a new thing on that bomb it's
gonna have its own separate timer what
yeah there's gonna be a thing with a
separate timer it's like a minute or 45
seconds or something huh and you're
gonna have to keep going back to that
every 45 or whatever it is seconds on
the bomb on the adjusted or I think I
think that's what's gonna happen
no no all right no there's there is a
new module and it looks like it has a
like a like a lever that you pull yep
and that's it there's no timer in it
there's no time around it should I pull
the lever no I think once you stop
fiddling with it that's time who's gonna
start pick him up pick a module let's go
okay uh symbols yeah okay backwards C
with two dots over it and the line in it
thank I that backwards II those
backwards you write backwards e then the
you and the I yep six with the flat top
yep and the number symbol kind of on a
diagonal six a flat top backwards e
number symbol and then the last one okay
we have simple oh oh now it did
something yeah yeah okay I see it okay
we have time for simple wires simpler we
have four wires yep to red to blue more
than one red was what's the last digit
of the serial number if it's odd cut the
last red wire is it odd yep cut the last
red wire good you fiddle with that I'm
gonna figure out the next thing tell me
what the next thing is gonna be while
you're fiddling we're don't know I don't
know it's on the other side oh my I see
what I have to do here okay I have 45
seconds again okay I read a press button
it's a button that earlier sorry a
yellow button that says press okay
yellow button that says press
oh my god or is there more than two
batteries yes or no two batteries there
are only two okay all right hold the
button and what color is it red you hold
it in the color okay I wondered any
position okay good I need to fiddle with
the finger yep yep that's tricky
can you remember one of the other ones
tell me already go oh it is it's another
button it's a blue detonate button blue
detonate theirs
I forgot how many back to that worth or
there's more than one battery the button
says detonate press and immediately
release next press and immediately
release oh the star of the Venn diagram
winters is our last one okay
you've been diagram yeah yeah okay a red
and white no LED no star does white
matter last digit is even or odd odd
leave it alone okay next blue and red
one red yes LED yes star do not cut the
wire okay
red wire mm-hmm no LED yes star cut the
wire next red wire yes LED no star LED
no star yeah red wire no star but it has
an LED but that crosses over into me oh
here we go two or more batteries or no
how many batteries and there's two or
more batteries cut the wire great next
one is white LED yes
star yes
cut it first time
that's the the one that with the lever I
said like hold it and that would make it
like recycle time but I had to hold it
down to reset the time then as soon as I
let go
kind of down again yeah yeah that's
really fucked up man that's really
fucked up that's a fucked up bomb maker
bomb man people say this rips apart
