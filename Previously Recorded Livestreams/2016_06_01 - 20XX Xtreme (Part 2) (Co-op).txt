I like I understand that that's the
that's the the big the hot game at the

Oh Kyle come and get you oh really
Joe what was down that's what got me I
think I saw that did I listen to the
newest half in the bag on x-men no I did
not because I like to see the movie
first so and I'm probably gonna see it
even though I don't care about it like
I'm gonna see it eventually so I'll
probably see it you know like I waited
to watch your Deadpool one until after
so tipple after came out on video
so no I usually wait until after I see a
movie to listen to the half in the bag
discussion or just talk to you guys
about a movie right so fuck you fuck
well I guess I need this now Oh way to
have my charge back now yeah but we
don't have a super jump anymore
one rage that fucker yeah
wait what
waitwait is no I hate platforms that
disappear
get it get it get it
Nene doesn't run so fast right now okay
great we did it so half in the bag x-men
I'm here I'm going to assume that J was
all right with it and my well J really
liked Days of Future past
so maybe J really liked it and Mike
thought it was all right but kind of
kind of had some problems I don't know
that's gonna be my assumption based
really on nothing I have nothing to base
that off of
now you know I don't I thought they were
gonna retract sometime
like oh we got dumpling fucked it's
almost like he knew where we were gonna
jump
there yeah that boss is all you jack all
you paid the price rich I paid the price
oh the time missile jump yeah yeah girl
jump do we both get that like if I get
this we get double double jump Trent
no max energy free it's free you know
yeah you need all those well we we
really know how to we we don't have any
special weapons though otherwise we
really know how to kick his ass
yeah but maybe you only get a weapon
okay
you can get that one
what's secret that we're missing check
maybe sometimes there's not secrets
procedural generation sometimes there's
just not secrets
charges new attacks even charger fuck
you penguin you know what fuck you
penguin Wow
goat just did not register the jump no I
like the charge because I just got that
charge here charge I think I'm better
off with rapid fire yeah yeah cuz I
don't have a range okay I just got to
charge your charge so I'm gonna hold on
to my charger charge
there's a helping you need it more oh oh
I do shit come on top - just drop down
yeah
yeah I do believe that is like reflected
off of item all right here we are rich
you got this we got this time to kick
some a else this major ass this major
Oh penguin some penguin ass be lucky you
got all that ice around your penguin for
all the ass pain you're gonna feel boom
nice boom it's like it's like that
wasn't even nothing what we got here max
energy don't care about that right now
nuts and bolts and I never used an ice
that I say I'm gonna get nuts and bolts
nice smart tech boom and you need health
I know it oh thanks oh sorry you are
still making up your mind yeah yeah what
should I get I got all this energy yeah
so but I got nothing to use with it
right so yeah the ice thing is fine I
find myself just not using maybe the
next weapon will be really good and I'll
be able to just spam it sure
but all right what a brother yeah we can
take them we can take him rich I believe
in the power of us you know what I'm
saying you shouldn't
I got take it easy here I'm getting
there getting mauled getting mauled
settle the eff down that's exactly what
I need to do wait I need those yep and I
lost them both while getting them that
that's just peachy keen fuck it all
ah hopefully I hate the stage we made it
yeah we made it isn't that all that's
important for getting mauled
helmut health pickups might grant armor
oh that's neat I'll take it sure how it
look like flat very Mega Man esque no
that's totally unlike Mega Man no what
would even make you say such a thing
rich what do you think down there yeah
this looks like it could be shop hello
what are we on text beam shots on screen
up and yeah
does that affect both of us I think you
have to wake up AK do you have to switch
isn't not letting you I don't know oh I
can only have one of those right or you
can only have one of those that's your
Nevers your old one right I think I
still have it how do you know how do you
know what you have that's huh
is that for both of us that looks like
me oh here you press Start I'll press
Start yeah see I still have to charge
your charge but I think it's telling me
I can choose or maybe you can choose
back maybe I think I'll stick the with
the charger charge then you can have the
faster attack what's this do you attack
speed and Mac shots on screen up so your
attack speed is more okay alright but
I'm gonna keep my charge you charge up
because I use it we only have to and
bolts left okay okay
I'm cheating I think you're actually
making it harder on yourself you think I
said that right as I felt right
didn't see that look what he blended in
with us I'm fuckin chameleon oh the
snake yeah yeah oh fuck you added whoa
whoa running away from fashion
run away from fire on a treadmill rich
oh yeah there's nothing over here we've
been to this level before I know it's
early access but you know a lot of these
procedurally generated levels and a feel
some way it must have like similar or
you know like like tiles Oh yep
you need the health
okay whoo okay all right no I like this
co-op once we get used to sharing yeah
absolutely
but that way that was a harsh that was a
harsh transition
I killed me it killed me rich I softened
him up for you
Wow I probably can't revive me though
because you only have one health nugget
bit left yep oh it's gonna do here no
here's fine it doesn't give a shit okay
oh I do like that thing yeah that's a
good power up all right oh there's only
two Wow that's fine I won't go the
Pokemon thing the bat thing or probably
the bat thing we can deal with I don't
wanna deal with that Pokemon thing all

Windows 10 machine everything went away
for a moment coming back now coming back
up coming back now sorry coming back now
all right and away we go let's see
anonymous is another great co-op game
that would be fun to watch you play is
Raymond it might be free you fucks
Raymond is a great game Rayman Origins
is a fantastic platforming game I played
it I love it yes that would be fun to
play hammer camp says the suda51
are for the suit of 51 fund
yes are you guys going to get the
PlayStation going to the PlayStation III
theater event the what I had heard
rumors about this that the e3 is playing
in some movie theaters no I can't that
sounds really obnoxious
I can't imagine we are loner our job
jack did you listen to the new staff in
the bag about x-men apocalypse Mike
stated it as an enjoyable as enjoyable
as x-men origins Wolverine there you go
there you go oh yeah answer that
question no I I'm trying to I think I've
brought one shit I know what I'm doing
now and I did wrong I've only listened
i-i've only listened to half in the bags
when I have already seen the movie
additional reach and damage I mean why
wouldn't you want that oh fuck it
replaces your sword yeah interesting
wait wait oh and he struck says hey guys
you two need a vacation from all these
video games do you guys like to travel
where would you go if you could take two
weeks off home for two weeks yeah I like
to travel I enjoy traveling and I think
traveling is very important for everyone
if I had to uninterrupted weeks
teleporters teleporters rich nothing but
trouble yeah
oh I would probably go to uh maybe
California like most of California do a
little time la do a little time
San Francisco do a little time in the in
the northern the like the RET Northern
California like camping shit I like
California I like visiting California he
only shoots at you when you hit him with
the shield toes in it that's it I like
visiting California so I think I would
do that yeah yeah oh I'd go I'd go all
over California for a little bit that's
what I would do if I had two weeks nope
earthworm jim HD has cooperates okay
that's gonna happen that's gonna happen
thoughts on DC making a Harley Quinn
movie personally I'd prefer a Joker
movie I think Harley Quinn has more of a
character do you more of a complex
character is what is to give to the full
thought on that okay I think Harley
Quinn has more of a complex character
well we actually know Harley Quinn's
backstory right not saying it wouldn't
be fun to have a Joker movie but I like
Joker as a villain you know did we play
broforce I've played it I think it sucks
I've never played it
I have no opinion because I've never
played it was free for PS Plus members
one month and so I downloaded it and
started playing it and
and it was boring as shit I didn't I did
not enjoy my time playing brothel so
what you're saying is is 10 out of 10
game of the year 10 out of 10 game of
year wood platinum platinum hit
release super double platinum in the
this chick you got really old for me is
you know you play as like famous action
movie characters so you can be like
command bro commando you could be rambro
bro bow comp Robocop Rocky Balboa I'm
sure right it's kind of amazing though
how many of them work with bro puns uh
yeah I give them credit there but uh you
know it is simple 2d platforming
shooting just got old got old yeah Tim's
that one's oh my god Jack the clown
stream my hat's off to you for your
commitment to that bit now stay away
from my house you creepy fuck
perhaps you're talking about Rich's solo
stream I heard there were some video
problems with that but I don't know what
you're talking about
I heard the video was glitching in and
out lots of people making weird clone
comments yeah I don't get it I just
think the color was off and so maybe
they were seeing stuff but I don't know
did it to do
I used to be a huge Harley Quinn fan
until the Arkham games turned her into
it obnoxious Juggalo yeah you know we'll
see what the Suicide Squad has to bring
so it's I I don't I don't like the art
direction of Harley Quinn as a Juggalo
we'll see what her and the movie has to
bring could be something interesting I
don't know I don't know run away from
the fire yeah I kept walking
sea urchin hijack we're in California
have you been so far besides LA City
hello from Orange County I've been all
over LA mostly LA but I've also been up
to San Francisco I had had a lovely guy
that got to go to a lovely wedding in
San Francisco the the wedding took place
kind of right right underneath the
Golden Gate Bridge it was a neat area
I've been up to the giant redwoods in
Northern California when I was younger
and damn is that a beautiful place to
drive through you know the giant giant
ash trees and I've been to like San
Diego
oh I went to Legoland - which is in
between San Diego and Los Angeles
Legoland in California and that was a
lot of fun Lloyd beets III clarified
that not a better character than the
Joker a more complex character than the
Joker Harley Harley Quinn has more
facets than the Joker has and I think
Harley Quinn can better hold a solo
movie than Joker good Joker is a very
nice villain I wouldn't necessarily want
to see the Joker show as well as a whole
movie so that that is my clarification
on better character a more complex
character that's right giant ash trees
and all the sushi and ramen i couldíve
fuck yes I'd go to California and eat
nothing but ramen nothing but ramen and
sushi exactly 3d beer goggle 3d beer
goggle says Harley Quinn is both a
villain and victims so that's kind of
neat she's got a little something to her
character not saying Joker doesn't but
he said he's a villain San Diego San
Diego is very beautiful nobody can find
her though huh well she's all over the
world rich shit she'd just love to hang
oh I felt like I needed to say something
cuz I said huh
yeah and so I was like I needed to see I
thought that Hall made it work
what doo-doo-doo-doo-doo you know now
they're they're citing that Harlequin is
not a victim she chooses to be with the
Joker it all depends on which continuity
were talking about it the Harlequin that
I know was seduced by the Joker so like
I consider that some sort of victimhood
and yes she chooses to remain with the
Joker but that there could be some sort
of Stockholm Syndrome there I believe
there are still more facets to her
character than there are two jokers Oh
Harley Quinn and poison ivy buddy movie
yes written by Shane Black who does
everything good ed waterfalls still
haven't seen the nice guys really want
to see the nice guys yeah
dad came up to visit from him a real
name yep and he brought the Mormon
sister with oh yeah and we had the
option of saying a movie uh-huh and nice
guys no I was playing of course oh yeah
it's off-limits oh I'm sorry that's all
right I was only gonna err - oh god rich
I was gonna err - I can't do right now
I'm I'm really excited to see the nice
guys unfortunately it's probably gonna
be one of those that I have to wait
until it comes on demand that's that's
just a lot of my life is doing stuff
after I get the kids to sleep boom
Kroll Raptor my friends and I are having
a best of the best of the worst movie

laughs and entertainment does it have to
be something was on best of the worst
I assume that's the idea if you're
having a best of the best of the worst
Miami connection - that one night where
we had Miami connection and deadly prey
Oh deadly preys brilliant wasn't that
also wrote or night though no road chart
we couldn't find anything else to watch
with we tried we had robot jacks just
good yeah and
we didn't do a third because we couldn't
find one that would work we tried
classes was a 99 or class of something
and the tape was broke we tried what did
we end up doing the third side bored
just a cyber tracker oh that's right and
that was just so bland we're talking
about if you got to choose three I mean
you can't go wrong with Miami connection
Deadly Prey and the samurai cop yeah
samurai cop is my go to mean factory
even that like even that's as boring it
parts samurai cop would be my go to
entertaining bad movie samurai cop in
Miami connection right up there in my
book you want to you know cuz and the
samurai cop is so bad right from the
get-go I guess so is Miami connection
but that's your best of the best of the
worst samurai cop Miami connection and
Deadly Prey right it's not fair you
can't see them you can't do Bream you
can't do Breen right off the bat you
have to get people acclimated to bad
movies first Breen is special yeah I'm
gonna say yeah you can't start with
Breen it's like starting right off with
Creek exactly you know what hey I wanna
unwind after a long day at work how
about some crack cocaine Breen is after
you've already desensitized yourself to
the senselessness that is bad movies
the old bean factory is is Beverly
Hollywood cop no Beverly Hills Oh hmm
Beverly Hills Cop II never really Hills
cabbage well Miss Hollywood cop
Hollywood cop was a American Tara
Beverly Hills in Beverly Hills that's
what it is
Hollywood cop was killing American style
director right yes yeah terror in
Beverly Hills is a pretty I mean Frank
Stallone's in it there's an old bean
factory that's where you get closed the
fucking door
that's really great Cameron you know Kay
anytime you get you know the good
Cameron Mitchell terror in Beverly Hills
is a good one but even that one has its
boring moments there you get Cameron
Mitchell and then I guess you could do a
Cameron Mitchell night where you do
terror in Beverly Hills
Deadly Prey and what's another good
Cameron Mitchell one those are really
the best yeah you get down there you get
down there in the dirt and the mud with
the rest of them and there ain't no
music down them it has to been at least
one Morgan Cameron Mitchell thing oh I'm
sure right I'm sure yes terror in
Beverly Hills the Frank Stallone movie
it's great
I want and I've got it already
oh no you didn't have this beer this
time oh that's right this is a new place
a new player low blows good not as good
as the other ones we've mentioned yeah
we're talking about a best of the best
of the worst
eh eh maybe your friend maybe you don't
know if your friends are gonna be into
bad movies so what's the good bad movies
to show people it's those three that's
what you start with
that's what I would start with I have
started with that before samurai cop
samurai cop is the go-to it's not a best
of the worst movie but you can't go
wrong with the room I've never seen it
the fuck is wrong with you you know how
I feel about Tommy Wiseau I don't care
for him you don't care for the best
cinema experience she possibly has what
you tell me well and you know what now
and now it's it's tough because I do
want to I want to see it like with a
fresh group of people but everybody's
seen it before
adds bonus and lever rewards if you're
fast
haven't seen the room I'll probably get
around to seeing it one of these times
one of these days and then I'll be like
oh my god you guys are so right it's the
best and everyone be like yeah I fucking
know you fucking years ago
yeah fucking program I'm not with it now
I'm not with the program there's no
program here rich is there nothing down
here
I've been up I'm not risking it Explorer
to find out ah
let's look Otis IV says Jack and rich
what were your childhood phobias and is
the next rlm feature going to be horse
ninja rich was there anything you were
particularly frightened of as a child
clowns
zombies zombies yeah like for real I
knew they weren't real but just think
the concept behind the Night of the
Living Dead movie sure the core all the
corpses just get up and they start
eating people alive so fucking horrific
that it freaked me the fuck out sure
sure I suppose and for me it's always
been Heights
yeah that's probably most people on the
surface some people really do like
shockingly do not mind Heights and and
they really bother me but but not it
like not just high up Heights either
like if I'm on the top of a ladder I'll
start to get shaky I've gotten better as
I've gotten older but I am just not good
with Heights just not comfortable
with Heights new deepwater says both can
tear both my eyes out I'm comfortable
thief wanted deep water shocking light
yeah there's no downside of this is
there no no there's not
I used to scuba dive like an and i
really liked it i really enjoyed scuba
diving guys got my number this is
technically this is early access when i
technically it's early access there
might not be an endgame yet they're good
yeah that's look that up is their engine
this uh yeah I did a couple dives in
Florida and a couple dives in Nassau
Bahamas and then just stuff here in
Wisconsin to keep my dive certification
up you have to do so many dives with
professionals a year to keep your dive
certification active so you do you like
dives at the police yeah no I like you
know some of the some of the dives like
one year just to keep my certification
up like I just had to go to a low like a
high school swimming pool you know yeah
so that wasn't very exciting but I did
this really cool dive in in the Bahamas
where they shot one of the old James
Bond movies and they still had some of
the boats down there so you could crawl
through old boats in a submarine I did I
did one of the the most fun dives I ever
did was in the Galapagos and I actually
got to swim with some giant sea turtles
ah
you can do it rich I believe in you and
that was one of the most amazing
experiences of my entire life is just
just swimming next to sea turtles that
were as big as you and wider
and it was beautiful and it's a lot of
fun I've since lapsed on my
certification as I have not gone diving
in quite some time
I used to dag and I liked it it was very
comforting yes I saw marine iguanas they
were so cool and they spit at you
not on purpose because they because they
spit the salt water that was in their
nose you know what the birth of my
children it was great like having
children was great but the experience of
swimming with giant sea turtles was
pretty fucking awesome
like the birth of my children I was a
you know what that was a long night but
there's a long and tiring night
appreciate your honesty
I love having them around but let's be
honest the actual birth that was hard
work mostly my wife's artwork but I was
there too you know she's probably like
this sucks it sucks but you know we've
got us two great kids and that was fine
but swimming nose to nose with giant sea
turtles that's that's up there on most
people's bucket lists that was up on
mine we did this thing in the Galapagos
where we followed Darwin's path it was a
tiny little cruise there's like a 10
person cruise that followed Darwin's
path and we got to scuba and see how
this stuff that Darwin saw who's neat
at least you're honest yeah you know I
love my kids I do you guys know I love
my kids they're there all the time
giant sea turtles are not there all the
time
what was that looking up again oh yeah
that was there in the game for 20xx all
the stuff that Darwin saw is not long
dead they they had giant land tortoises
in the Galapagos that had Muscat scars
on them tiny holes in their shells that
were from musket shots that's fucking
amazing what the hell is that how you do
it first thing I'm gonna do is not die
sure I guess
always a close reach nice
WTF now how bad a shadow you to not kill
giant or no but it's a musket that this
shell couldn't or the the the musket
bullet couldn't break through the shell
they don't care they don't care there is
no information on whether or not there
is an endgame that I can see means no
which means I'm dead which means there
might be an endgame but no one's really
talking about it right now jack part of
musket with them that was neat
we got the feed him feed the giant
tortoises you want to you want to eat
this and then they go you think dumbass
tortoises it was great
it's a great time fucking Galapagos oh
and the next is the next feature gonna
be horse ninja yeah comes out tomorrow
anonymous says holy shit I just now
received the prereq t-shirt you guys
signed for me it's been so long that I
thought it got lost thanks for all the
hours of entertainment you've give me
you're welcome
you're welcome male male slow sometimes
it happens okay amazing shit all over
this world I you know I I enjoy
traveling and and I have made a points
to travel I think it's very important
I think it's important my children are
almost old enough to start traveling and
not be and not be a giant pain in my ass
while traveling so which is a really
important part of traveling is having
people think and pain in your ass well
is is having people with you that are
not a giant pain in the ass then you
know not much of an option not much of
enough that would be a dick move on my
part see you guys so siggy focus I'm out
I'll be back whenever
peace whatever sometime whatever go fuck
yourself I'm going to dehii tea I don't
have it out for the kids I'm just honest
that children are assholes everyone
knows this everyone knows this it's
something that that many parents don't
talk about but children are giant
assholes and it's your job as a parent
to teach them not to be such assholes in
public and I take that job very serious
inherently selfish of course they have
to be because they can't do shit when
they're born
adults are assholes too but hopefully
the adults know how to handle themselves
in public
adults can hide have learned to hide
being an asshole for long enough that
they're slightly tolerable but tolerable
in short stints yes yes the boogeyman
your job is to teach kids not I don't
you know what I have stayed away from
all this gorilla kid news that's all
that's I don't I know nothing about the
gorilla kid what I know is that the the
zoo said that they wanted to they shot
the gorilla and they thought it was the
right move to save the kid yeah oh you
think you think it was the right move to
save the kid huh I literally know
nothing about this situation uh what I'm
gonna say that I'm gonna go ahead and if
that's what the zoo said I'm gonna go
ahead and trust that uh that that is
true I know nothing what did do you know
anything about the gorillas dude I know
there was a gorilla beating a kid to
death because I'm a kid what the cage
but you shouldn't for something with a
kid felons of the girl and they shot the
gorilla yeah might not have been fell I
don't know it might have been being
irresponsible as he was a kid though
right I don't know I don't know nothing
about it they shot the gorilla come on
it seems like the right call but again I
know nothing
I know nothing about it I think I think
that's the that's the judgment calls
like yeah you know what we're like maybe
the gorillas won't do anything or maybe
the gorillas will tear the baby in half
take care of the grill should the baby
have not been in there sure the best of
my knowledge the gorilla was in the
process of tearing the kid in half
I don't know I think that would have
there seems to be like what I know about
the situation is I keep hearing like
people upset about them shooting the
gorilla probably PETA
so maybe it was I don't know you know
what Peter would value the guerrilla
more in the kid well Lou Derek said the
gorilla had already broken the kids like
yes oh yeah then fine yeah yeah you
shoot the gorilla so everything's fine
everything's fine by me okay
it's fucking gorilla all right bedroom
full suck this fucking gorilla nice ooh
I don't give a shit
oh no Peter doesn't give a shit about
animals animals people huh Peter doesn't
give a shit on animals no no no Peter
PETA is the like largest destroyer of
animals how does this work
Peter Peter routinely kills someone
someone give me the correct information
about this I remember reading this a
while ago
Peter euthanizes they would rather
euthanize animals than have them live in
what they deemed to be unfair or
suffering conditions but what they've
deemed to be suffering conditions is
like any pet and so they euthanize a
shit ton of animals hmm yeah Peter
things and animals better dead than in
captivity strange yes
strange people those PETA I agree maybe
that's why I said I think I might have
thought in a Penn & Teller bullshit show
I forget I forget it doesn't matter they
shot the gorilla I don't care I'm I just
don't care that they shot the gorilla
I hate zoos in general and I and I have
to go to zoos often as I'm a parent but
it's so lame people really take their
kids to the zoo everybody fuckin
everybody goes to the zoo zoos one of
the lamest places in the world animals
don't do shit you know it's hot that
nobody bothered no oh people love the
zoo people fuckin love the zoo kids good
I see an animal they walk around in the
Hat for eight hours it's gross I'm
coming up very anti children now but I
don't care fucking hate the zoo
I think parenting does that yeah
I'm just not a zoo I'm not a zoo person
you know I think I would be more of a
zoo person if either the animals did
cool shit or there was more shade that
is those two real things I that I hate
about the zoo the animals don't do cool
shit and there's no shade anywhere at
least in the Milwaukee zoo no fucking
shade anywhere there's some fuckin shade
I'm a pale pale man
yeah
animals do shit for example they shit
that you sit there I mean it's nice you
get to see an animal I guess you get to
see an animal that you normally wouldn't
get to see I don't know it could just be
that I'm uh I'm a jaded old man but I
feel like zoos are bullshit that's why I
don't give a fuck about this gorilla
that was shot firmly firmly anti zoo if
I like I am I just I think they're dumb
I think they're dumb the animals don't
do anything sure why zoos are bullshit
why is this recession
I'm sure there's like I'm sure they're
doing good or maybe they're hurting the
animals just fucking let the animals go
in the wild or kill them I don't care we
can all agree that's the right thing to
do just kill that maybe I am Pro PETA I
don't know just kill mo let animal Jesus
sort em out you know
now you know what the museums are great
museums you get museums you get to see
shit you get to see cool shit and it's
inside it's inside an air-conditioned
that's great
yeah animal Jesus regular Jesus doesn't
take care of the animals they don't go
to heaven they go to the animal heaven
that's a way different heaven I think
you get to see a puppy in heaven you
don't it's in the Bible I'm gonna beat
this fucker it's in the Bible yep if I
need to be remembered for one thing it's
for this quote let the animals go in the
wild or kill them I don't care it's it's
true that's exactly how I feel about
zoos beyond infinite says I've been a
longtime fan and lurker I just want to
thank you jack and rich for your unique
funny and refreshing entertainment you
any plans to play doh a deus ex god
bless you rich Evans lol fuck my cock no
media plans I know that's one of those
games that people really like no the
Deus Ex never never played it have you
ever played it a little bit I believe
yeah
the older one way back when I played a
little bit of Pelican pencil here's
here's the real thing Pelican pencil
keeps on bringing up like things they
could have done in that situation we
have had when did this happen yesterday
two days ago your day more than we have
had days to think about the proper way
to handle this to handle this situation
they perceived it to be threatening and
they dealt with it as is their job to
deal with shit they perceive to be
threatening second-guessing them doesn't
do us really any good at this point it's
there it's you know what they owned the
monkey it was in their right to shoot it
how about that they owned that monkey
what are they saying they could have
done oh you know what you could they
could have resolved it peacefully what
way did you want to risk this child's
life oh well you know as the people
around him that were that were
endangering this situation yeah but the
situation happened yeah
we can't change that you just have to
deal with it how you're risking the wife
oven look at how old was this kid who
have four it's kid who's kid I fuckin
don't know I don't fuck yeah well and
then and then we would have had a whole
different conversation had we tried to
spare the gorilla and the kid ended up
dying right right oh my god a shot they
shot the fucking grill no question you
shoot the fucking grilling why do they
try a Swedish massage on the grill oh
they should have just shot it are you
saying a Swedish massage my work my work
didn't try it because they're
insensitive bastards I mean they had
minutes to think about it
seconds then seconds jack yeah they had
to make a judgment call in second oh but
they could have given them the grill
massage oh my god yeah it's so fuckin
it's better be fucking worth it
what are you attack speed
let's axe beat and Mack shots on screen
up so what one is that your charge
attack vaporizes enemy shots what do you
want faster faster
stabby or charge attack I don't I don't
notice any increase in the attack speed
the question is how you gonna are you
gonna utilize the charge attack yeah
okay
do that one the attack speed is exactly
the same max shots on screen that
doesn't matter for this guy he sees one
he's using a sword sure sure that just
does nothing for me
yeah
why that's the question why is this even
a question animals are killed in defense
of humans all the time right it's
because there's nothing else really
happening this week and so this is the
bullshit thing that people are talking
about it's because the kid didn't die
and so we have the luxury to you know
hypothesize about this had the kid died
it wouldn't this would have been a note
oh no brainer but because the kid is
safe now and they made the correct
decision we got the UH little bullshit
bullshit and the zoo is gonna have
probably I have to put the special shit
in place and you're starting with a shit
re oh not that one you're certainly okay
I can deal with that
Oh boom there we go boom think that easy
be easy peasy 'm it's all bullshit
everything's all bullshit where's this
HP minus one and you get a oh no I
misread I misunderstood that if you if
you were like one car get a fine fuckin
nut out of that well-being of your one
nut sure oh yeah wrong call for this
situation but in general I can get him
it's a wrong call for every situation
it's the wrong call for every yeah yeah
well I could get this really amazing
power up but I'm one nut short there was
no no no just no yeah yeah just know
we're getting green shielding guys now
you must be doing very well particularly
oh great what time is the jack at 10:30
810 we start are you running out of
steam
I'm sensing you're running out of steam
oh the the chats
I'll caught up on this gorilla bullshit
tell me something else I was waiting for
the chat to move on you you that's how
do you feel about the Smurfs growing up
is that easy
oh is that easy jack did you did you
like this verbs no no no Smurfs are
bullshit aren't they aren't this Murph's
the biggest load of horseshit ever
there's a little blue things little blue
shit who gives a shit
mrs. Smurf wad that's really annoying
that's nothing Deering it's just
obnoxious
oh and do we Smurf the Spooner bullshit
little asshole let me stick my Smurfs
and your Smurfs yeah Oh smooth I get it
bullshit right back to 911
Kaycee banner live says jack if you
caught your kids making cancerous
YouTube comments how would you handle
the situation to find cancerous YouTube
comments yeah you know being a dick you
like the comments we we see on our
videos you know if I caught him being a
dickhead online ID comma dickhead stop
being a dickhead I think we're still you
know being being a having a presence
online is still a relatively new thing
and so hopefully I will impart on them
how you act online should be the same as
you act when you are offline oh that's
the that's the real help
anything you say online you need to
imagine that you are right next to that
person and and as always treat others as
you would like to be treated that's
that's that's what we always so if I
caught them making can't I don't know
how do you punish I think how do you
punish a dickhead behavior you know cuz
like it's not like it's not like they're
stealing oh hey that's a that's an
interesting question how do you punish
just being a dick heavy I caught my kid
being a like a genuine bully like a
genuine bully a bully to some other kid
I would make him give all of his goddamn
Christmas presents to that kid we've
been drive over to the house on
Christmas Day mm-hmm and we give the kid
that he was bullying all of the gifts or
his birthday or whatever you know the
nearest holiday was to is sure bad
behavior yeah I can see that for
bullying and then you can't just punish
your kid you got to make it up to the
other kid absolutely I'm sorry my kid
was a dicK
yeah I mean obviously like if I caught
him making like if I caught him being a
dickhead online first thing that would
happen is is they would not be online
you know remove we would we would remove
their access to the Internet
that's number one
cuz that's easy you know like fine and I
only seem at that point they'll have
like their own computer or their own
phone or whatever it's like boom you
don't get the internet anymore
changing the Wi-Fi password fuck
yourself you know why cuz I'm a tech
savvy parent I know how to do that shit
but you know I think it's a it has a lot
you know that also has a lot more to do
with just how you raise them in general
you took oh my god way back there so you
know my real hope is that I've been
teaching them enough already
where shop where they wouldn't they
wouldn't make that kind of comments in
the first place right that's what you
hope yeah
like what they'll do when you take away
their weight what
well I don't have a daughter Whitman
Johnson so I will not freaked out about
my daughter's first boyfriend I will
freak out about my son's first
girlfriend especially as they get older
I won't be a grandparent too soon no I'm
saying no I'm sick wrap it up kids just
wrap it up Oh gaming wait that was
actually incredibly impressive I don't
want to sound too surprised
but oh I don't know you know I think I'd
be fine with it yeah you gotta be you
have to be fine with that that's how
that's how you move it on daughter son
p.m. you have the talk wrap it up make
sure you wrap it up god damn it wrap it
up I'm talking about wrapping up your
wiener when having sex by the way
usually with some sort of condom condom
condom I don't condemn the condom nice
you're not gonna get it this is the boss
what if my sons want to take up vaping
I'll just tell them not to do it in Home
Depot Richie Rich and I were we're set
shopping at Home Depot the other day and
some oh my god first hit some dickhead
was vaping inside of Home Depot
we're like what cool like I get it that
it's not like technically illegal or
whatever but it's still a dickhead move
you don't vape indoors
Dragonite all every Dragonite is talking
about spanking children punishing
children with physical violence every
study on the subject has said the exact
same thing about spanking your children
which is it does significantly more harm
than good you you are basically you know
to boil it down what you are teaching
the kid is sometimes sometimes it's okay
to hit people and you know when you're
an adult you have situations where
hitting people you have to you know if
you're in a fight or what not but a kid
can't understand shit like that it does
way more harm than good spanking way
more it does not teach them anything all
it teaches them to do is not trust you
because you're the one that hurts them
there are other ways to punish them and
get results every single study on the
subject of spanking is in complete
agreement agreeance is that a word
the what the political talk is full-on
banned now we try not to talk about
political stuff I guess spanking is kind
of political but we try not to talk
about the political stuff just because
it's it's a dragon
we're here to entertain I guess I'm
talking spankings kind of a political
subject I guess all the way off I guess
I guess it is doesn't matter the point
is it's the last I'll talk on the
subject
don't vape indoors that's Greece gross
it's fucking we don't need it we don't
need the club vaping I think it's
political now someone was talking about
political stuff
I
could I chant could have a chance to fix
the top-right corner of the green screen
oh that's right someone mentioned that
earlier so you know what I didn't and
it's too late now
dreams almost done so fucking what our
green screen you moves I don't know
maybe we didn't check it that thoroughly
when we set it up I mean we didn't move
it since last stream
yeah but the camera might have moved oh
yeah yeah Wow
you know they say they say the vaping is
healthier we don't know anything about
vaping there aren't many studies on
vaping you still shouldn't do it indoors
cuz you make a big cloud and it smells
it's just polite it's polite not to do
it we don't know anything about
secondhand effects yet studies need to
be done I don't like it I don't like the
smell of it it's just polite not to do
it I saw a guy vaping during a film but
but it was Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas so I let it slide now vaping isn't
being a hipster if you're a hipster you
roll your own cigarettes yeah you have
you have your little tobacco and you
roll your own that dead be a hipster
thing vape vaping is like a that's a
millennial thing that's something that
the kids do they vape
the vapors
what cigar those cigars aren't hipster
cigars have been you know like
fashionable for a long enough so guys
are just cigars cigarettes are just
cigarettes but if you if you like roll
your own whatever then that's hipster I
and I guess you could be a vaping
hipster if you're like really into the
gear you know or it's like you're all
about like the wattage and blah blah
blah this this is my coil is it reaches
this temperature but you know it's very
it's actually input my coil is imported
from from a Japanese model so it's very
very exclusive very exclusive very rare
and you know it takes a little extra
care to make the vape that I want but
you know it's worth it it's worth it for
this movie
this mood pole that would be a hipster
vape did you know that some institutions
classify Millennials as the generation
starting in 1981
really I still don't qualify I do then
born in 1981 that's what I was born I'm
not a millennial though I thought I was
a generation ye rich you're an X I think
I'm y-you might be why do I forget if I
am X it's the tail fucking end right
it's all it's all wobbly meaningless
distinction it's all meaningless
distinguish I was I was born yes as
we're many people like uh-huh yeah I
assumed you were born by the way I know
you never told me that but I assumed you
were yeah yeah turtle though wise says
heading to Peru tomorrow with my dad we
are hiking up Machu Picchu Sonne shit so
just out of curiosity how much would it
cost for you guys to stream
a Sierra classic Space Quest quest for
glory well why do you care you're hiking
up Machu Picchu maybe he doesn't like
those dreams and he wants us to get him
over with while he's hiking we we will
we will we want to stream more of those
games we probably will oh yeah this is
this is the money gun right here rich
you got a maid now you got a maid now
we'll see I think I got used to using
the sword guy no let's see here so
otherwise I'll so I did a bunch of
research on vaping if the liquid or a
cigarette doesn't specifically say they
are using vegetable glycerin then they
are then they use ethanol to capture the
flavor so you are vaping alcohol oh sure
I guess I don't know
and a little bit about it while I was
making some commercials for them but I
don't know everything about vaping I
know the the vaporizers like the the the
units not the e-cigarettes but like the
big handheld units are complicated as
fuck he's much easier with her oh I can
only assume
Oh cuz you want to see turtle why's he
wants us to stream it so he can watch it
when he gets back we will do more sierra
technical text adventure games we like
those we like those confirmed for VAP
estai have never vaped while I was
making commercials for people who did
VAP liquid in e-cigarettes and stuff I
was asked several times if I wanted to
try some and they would give mean on
nicotine ones you know you can just you
don't need to vape nicotine you could
just vape the flavor and make a cloud
it's a fuckin point well right and they
just asked me oh you you can do that
like if you want just to get a feel for
these things and I was like no I'm good
that's not - I'm not that's not my bag
I'm not into that Shh but I visited a
lot of vape shops and and and around a
lot of industry people for a while I was
doing those commercials and they are
into it these people are into vaping the
so they're actually in doing something
like slime bags oh well the you know the
companies I worked for yeah like they
were vaping in their office they were
huge like advocates like we were talking
to this one lady for this company that I
was making videos for and you know like
her her mom was a smoker she was a
former smoker and she her mom like got
throat cancer or something and so she
started to get into vaping and like it's
it's a mission for her to get people to
stop smoking you know tough call
tough call shotgun or quad shot what's
Chet thing
Chet shotgun or quad shot tri shot or
quad shot
no it hasn't caught up to us yet huh oh
yeah that's other game and and with the
research isn't there yet Claude is he
quad quad I see a shot do him
quad quad shot yeah everyone saying you
got a quad I had the quad when I did
that amazing run I had a pretty good run
with the Tri though the the real thing
is the research is not in on vaping we
don't know we don't know more than we
know about vaping we don't know if it's
healthier is the real thing
by van thanks for coming out all this
help and I don't need it they're naming
States Naidu I don't know why you guys
are naming States that seems odd to me
I did read my tips the last was from
turtle the wise he talked about vaping
that's what got us talking about vaping
remember and the one before that was
from turtle arise about going to machu
picchu we talked about that
get it together you get it together
mines my shits together there's nothing
there's more to vape than just water
vapor you know there's the chemicals
that make up the nicotine there's the
chemicals that make up the flavoring
there's this shit in there and that's
not just water which is where the the
science needs to be done we can't talk
about state to end baby I just didn't I
just didn't know why you were naming
States
it just seemed weird that someone was
just typing in North Dakota Oregon it
was a weird thing to see in the chat
that's such a North Dakota let's work on
yeah you didn't know her gun you got -
midair can't afford that I have to huh
well I have to you can only afford the
extra heart this is one of those times
where you you know help for nut
marylande Utah all of these things
that was depressing that was a
depressing store visit wow you just
didn't have any nuts
oh yeah here's why we're naming States
try to name all 29 states that don't
have an S in them within two minutes oh
that's hard like have you ever just
tried to name it are you guys that bored
oh it's all about vaping come on we're
not we're not we're not delving into a
rich territory right here have you ever
done that game where you try to name all
50 states in one sitting
no it's fucking hard oh you know what
all 50 states are kind of but if you
ever tried to name them in one sitting
it's hard it's probably really hard if
you're not from here like someone from
England but have a heart of time to that
I couldn't name like I could name all
the Canadian provinces no no I couldn't
come close there's a lot like four how
the fuck am I supposed to get over there
do you got do you make a jump don't
forget about to make a gentle what make
a jump holy press jump and dash at the
same time and you do a longer jump
I need higher jump yeah it does higher
to almost add it almost had it
Oh Oh what was it what was it about the
higher jump yeah you almost had it
this isn't it I don't there are third
there are 13 Canadian provinces I didn't
know I don't know nothing thought nope
maybe you're just not supposed to make
that can you go somewhere else no oh no
ma'am
yeah I don't know if the makers of this
game can get two more weeks Oh fuckin
finally are we talking about this with
salt and sanctuary yep
where can you can mighty number 9 gets
ooh 10 well that's heavy
oh no thought there was a wedge oh fuck
my nutsack
oh I'm sorry rich you know the question
is can you copyright game mechanics even
though this is very Megaman it's not a
game called Megaman
and yes we we all agree that this game
does look is very much better than
mighty number 9 we don't know anything
about mighty number 9 mind you
it's a 2d side-scrolling shooter is that
unique enough gameplay to be
copyrightable nope nope and at least
this one you know has slightly like
different stuff to it you know it has a
roguelike element it has that you know
what that really looks like a Ledge
yeah well no it's instinct it looks like
a Ledge I'm with you rich I am
absolutely with you that looked like a
Ledge
I knew that wasn't a ledge of this time
and it's still look like a Ledge Jack
what's your favorite rich Evans line of
all time - tails you dumb motherfucker
you know there's there's so many there's
so many you know rich Evans is wise and
the thing I like most about rich Evans
is he is often able to articulate things
in such a specific and bitchy way that
is but that is both insightful and funny
you know so there's just there's too
many there's too many
one of one of very early on in free rec
rich and I were having a conversation on
early access games this is just
something I remember and rich-rich had
convinced me to change my tune on some
early access stuff it was specifically
about you know like Kickstarter and
funding them and sometimes you don't get
what you what you uh you don't get what
you were promised or you don't get what
you thought it was gonna be and rich
goes yeah but you get that with a
regular game two companies get that when
they make a game it's not the game they
thought it was gonna be you know it's
still a game and as I go it is
incredibly insightful and correct but
also bitchy enough to be funny I
remember that I remember that very
specifically and it is it has made me
rethink how I feel about indie and early
or kick-started in early access games I
still don't like playing them as I like
waiting for the finished product but
goodnight
tyranny Soros Rex I'm not indirectly
calling Richard bitch I think I'm very
directly calling him a bitch but I'm
calling him a funny bitch so what can
you do
exactly there's nothing indirect about
this that's right well yeah it
Kickstarter you might get shit although
soon enough I backed mighty number 9 I
don't know I don't I cannot remember why
I backed it and of course you know like
they've delayed the game so many times
now yeah it's been so long I just have
no idea why I backed it but you know
Mega Man creator wants making a Mega Man
game yeah sure yeah that sounds like fun
I like Mega Man yes rich and I have seen
samurai cop 2 we have no specific
thoughts on it
ah the blue blaze says weren't you guys
going to play the Syria cleanup detail
after the last doomed stream forgot
about it rich even said that I spoiled
it
oh that's right and we forgot about it
because rich found this Megaman game no
this is an effort alas I was thinking
about more like ever last time we stream
the 3d doom the new one right this has
been a while so I think since that
promise was made
yeah I don't know maybe one of these
days maybe I'll play without rich good
rich is giving you a second chance
that could have been something awesome
though yeah it was but it wasn't
what's the hens of rush Jack since I
enjoy seeing the chat being flooded
could we please all type Bing
go Bongo at the same time on your count
much obliged
okay so I'm gonna go one two three go
and on go everyone type bingo Bongo is
everybody ready
is everybody ready one two three go
that's great that's great bingo bango so
what does this do
incredible protection shield that kills
the frailest core I mean oh oh
max armor but one oh but your armor
doesn't regenerate well you got research
through experimentation rich you had to
try
it's actually an aspect of roblox I
don't like him I want to know what the
fuck I'm doing
why I'm doing you want to make an
informed decision sure likes don't care
about that great thanks for all the
bingo bango guys I think they really
helped helped what I don't know let's
talk about bingo bango for a little bit
you know I can talk about someone was
chatting with me on Steam the other day
I found out I found a really adorable
card game that's good to play with the
kids you know try out we're trying to
get the kids into board games as fast as
possible but board games can be tough
you know a lot of them are slow or
they're far too easy so adults can't
play them so finding like a good board
game that you can play with your kids
but you can still be entertained while
playing it's a really tough thing I
found this neat one called sushi go it's
very simple like match the cards and the
cards can do different things but it's
fun and it's got cute characters and
they're the kids really like it's got
little sushi things but there's also
like a strategic element to it where you
have to like swap hands and isn't even
sushi go I recommend it if you have
little ones and want to get them into
board games oh you always get me with
that you forgot you forgot about this
second
Kevin - magic yeah
sushi God it's a it's a cute game it's
not incredibly deep like I can't imagine
playing it with a group of adults but
for a kids game it's pretty fun yeah yes
we have Dickson
we have Dixit as well that is also a
neat game
meaty boom oh that's alright
rich what was that version of brutal
doom you were playing on stream last
time I've been looking forward since
last time I can't find anywhere there's
20 bits just the new one just brutal
just new look of brutal doom played on
gzdoom Levis is a source port gzdoom if
you've what's throwing you off is
probably the visor which isn't from
brutal doom that's from a different mod
called the ultimate doom visor the
ultimate doom visor yeah is this is a
secondary mod yep that you have on
brutal doom yeah ok but it's just the
newest brutal doom it's just the newest
brutal doom yes I'm sure
anonymous appreciates your knowledge MAV
LP we are not playing megaman this is
certainly not a megaman game this is
20xx not a megaman game that's the full
title of the game which you know i think
they should change whoa
full title of the game is I'm surely
going to die well yeah
oh my god three times in a row rich this
game wants you to happen the madness the
madness of it I hate everything evil
evil we stopped streaming a link before
were a link between worlds before it got
good but I have been playing it and
enjoying it I just got the Zora fin so I
can swim now I've been playing it in
between other fans its shields fuck
everything so we stop streaming it then
but you know whoa nice
whoo you just got plus two armor yeah
imported on tape there should be above
all there should be a bubble always
above Rich's head that says god I wish I
could just play doom you know nah it's
not like we'll never play doom again
it's just you know it's it's always
important to keep things fresh if I want
to play Doom I'll play Doom I don't care
about Jack's stupid obsession with
always playing something different okay
keep fresh I like that we keep it fresh
keep a new play definitely a different
game it's important things that are
enjoyable to watch they're known
commodities and that's you know what
that's fine we can do both by you we
played doom and then we played brutal
doom so that was a lot doom play some
different things that's okay too
what does the X X and xx xx mean I'd
like to say it leave Megaman I don't
know what it means but I you know the
Megaman games yeah they take place in
the year 20xx because they don't specify
it oh that's weird
yeah they think it means kisses so it's
like 20 kisses maybe 20 kisses all right
yeah is xxxx hugs though xoxo as hugs
and kisses so I think exes are it's not
the exes for kisses
I think the O's are kisses cuz they're
like your lips when you look okay
EXO means hugs and kisses I won't forget
about the Earthworm Jim co-op
exes are kisses
yeah I'm done okay yeah but you drank
like a pucker yeah but it's looking so
cool it's more of us it's more of a
fucker
it's closer to a circle than an X it's a
stupid fucking symbol I don't need eggs
thank you how am i I do need to go
grocery shopping any more coffee and I
need some more almond milk what did I
think of the final boss of doom 2016 is
kind of lame like the Boston bosses in
99% of every first-person shooter all
the boss battles were kind of lame I
made a first-person shooter that's had
good boss battles even a third person
named any shooter other than vanquish
that has had a good boss battle I have
you know on half-life 2 you fight these
giant Walker things it's like this big
epic battle yeah and you get it like a
rocket launcher and you fight these
giant tripod walkie things like like and
and like you have a whole group of
people fighting with you it's pretty
awesome pretty awesome boss fighting ok
portal they're saying portal portal had
a pretty awesome boss fight agreed
Metroid Prime series is good but well
you know those aren't Nintendo Wii boss
fights but I still think pretty good
boss fights Metroid the Metroid Prime
series yeah a guy could get down with
them you know the the hardest thing
about the boss fights from doom 2016 was
right before the boss fights you had
these epic arena battles with hundreds
of enemies that were far more intense
than the boss battles yeah and so even
give me a less per round oh my god
what's that over there and then you go
to memorize the pattern yeah so like
give me a less powerful boss that has a
bunch of minions with them and I'd be
happier much happier
the mr. Frese boss fight in Arkham City
while we're talking we're talking
first-person shooter first person
shooters Tim I'll even accept like gears
in for like a third person shooter sure
yeah then you know I think it's been
done before these bosses were pretty
weak but you know a slight it's rare if
it's done well I could agree with that I
can agree with them and it doesn't
matter cuz the rest of game was so good
it doesn't fucking matter that the
bosses were lame okay now is the time in
