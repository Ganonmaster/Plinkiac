because I was wrong I had some
controversial statements about the
Columbine where I said that maybe
bullying was a factor in the shootings

videogames yeah and I looked into it a
little bit it doesn't seem like they
were really bullied it turns out they
were just psychopathic monsters and boy
did you get this I was I was talking
about I wonder you didn't go too far

host mode because you can automatically
host other channels when you are not

and then dive there's what I think you
need to do but I'm not sure no no oh
that was almost sweet that was almost
there
can I just run down like I fall down the
stairs no matter what so I think I need
to like jump blue one of like space jump
to get high and then dive from there
maybe like dive dive but that looks I
mean I still end up on the ground do you
know oh I figured maybe if you four high
enough it might be enough oomph to get
to him from the top of the stairs hold
on the slo-mo button come on come on
perfect perfect okay
oh god horrible rumpa live bullet
strikes innocent pile of money Oh God
look at bomb a bomb

six time bankrupt president dies yes
turn out turn turned too damn late Jack
that turn turn turn
no little tution little too soon oh I'm
Lee the rule split the difference it'll
be fine I also think if I jump first

dramatic enough I like hitting him again
oh oh okay how's it fit wait turn turn
turn

cash now doing it for the month doing it
for the money there's another wrestling
icon yeah so we can probably do more
wrestling stuff totally we want to do
more restaurant I'll save that for you
I'll do one more of these okay and you
can do some cool ass
oh my god the social commentary yeah I
think yeah I think that's the smart
thing no oh no I don't think that's the
smart thing I should appreciative job oh
no no you can't get up you have to be on
the platform dammit space and jump
towards the platform I mean the stairs
I mean it's jumping nope nope dump it
jumping down towards the stairs yeah
jump no I just don't yeah yeah I got
this I got this
jump dive no no no I got to go over the
barrels all right but I think if I jump
and dive don't dive just jump all right
all right I think I need to die or oh
wait you know what
also I'm a super dumb because we can
just go like this yes you are no that's
okay we got further this time
space oh no no no no okay we can do this
we can do this and do do do do do doop
doop doop some of them nope just restart
alright alright dive oh my god oh my god
let's go up and say hi the subtlety is
great so I get points for letting them
out of their cage no the subtlety is
great
look sometimes sometimes satire is too
subtle sometimes sometimes the
sledgehammer is what's necessary I'm
with you sometimes the truth is so
absurd it's indistinguishable from
parody yeah boom boom hit him again like
10 years ago if they had made a
fictional movie about Trump running for
president would you would you think it
was just ridiculous of course it was
ridiculous when Biff Tannen was mayor
those debate scenes were just completely
unbelievable
I think I have to knock down that pillar
I think you I think you got it but it
was oh that was enough that was enough
boom
you know sometimes there's a little joy
in the world a song in your heart and a
giant taco crushes Donald Trump can you
break through those oh there is like
aims for ya you have to dive it like the
last second there's a second
I think running around is the right call
okay wait for the shit wait for the
shadow scroll up or not yeah I can't
have to waiting for the shadow again no
oh maybe not now maybe do we see a
tackle shadow that's the I don't know
that we do it's worth waiting for
yes we do you see it from further back
okay it doesn't show up right under him
it shows up from yeah
okay you keep an eye out for that chato
now
I got this
all the way over here
this is gonna be kind of hard timing I
don't I don't think you're gonna have
that much Sun oh you mean just having a
consistent yeah oh come on I like where
you're home but I just don't run as far
over here
maybe he'll maybe he'll do you have to
do the dot that the dive to knock him
over
I do you need the dive to knock him over
oh you're just running into him do it
now got a second one coming get out of
the way too soon I think game changer
right here game changer right there yep
this is more amusing that it should be
there's enough good game in here I
figured this is a good old a lot sooner
than it has
boys don't tell me there's a third one
don't tell me there's a goddamn third
one we haven't gotten the wind message
yeah yeah oh there you go you're safe
boom oh fuck I hit replay jack and
there's no going to the next chapter
god dammit I'm sorry you hit 2 to move
forward and aren't you no okay first the
regular knock over
a little bit hit him again
was that enough was that enough was that
enough whoa
if you first you do like I'm just know
that yeah that's great I didn't know you
can do all this shit yeah it said other
keys do things to to encourage you to
experiment with the keys on that one
I think this taco it just whenever he
gets knocked yeah
the second taco man
the second taco is the problem it's the
second taco that's a problem move set
ahead a long ways him like towards the
front of the stage
cuz the tag was longer than it is wide
right yeah that that did it unless he
gets killed by falling off the stage
nope oh you did it jack he's with the
people he's with the people of - I'm not
reset to flip
they got like the Donkey Kong stars on
them

save the president Jack no you cannot
save the president at this time flips it
to and flips and shit do and flips and
shit and sure it's fine it's fine it's
fine it's fine you might have to dodge
in front of the bullet no no you got it
you got it you got it boom we can't take
the stairs if you hit the sand you don't
get up yeah yeah hit him one more time
okay it's your job jack huh it's your
job that doesn't mean I can't smack him

you can do it right uh you know what and
I never played the first one

nothing but good it's absolutely
fabulous Jack and I've just I'm sorry
that my mic is quiet I will try to get
it closer to my face I've never played
it I've heard great things so I have I
have exactly zero feelings about Red
Dead Redemption - oh it's it's fucking
fantastic oh yeah yeah no I've heard
nothing but good things but whoa an idea
come on let's see here
turtle wife says to stop didn't work
that didn't work just to have any
political talk from occurring in said
game I would like to propose someone
create a series based off of super hero
the super hero Moon Knight if you are
unfamiliar his perspective would be rad
on TV look it's official if you're not
being a jerk about it you can politely
talk about politics yeah oh and I do
hear that my mic is a little quiet
that's why I moved to closer to my face
hopefully this is less quiet hopefully
this is less quiet for you guys
twitchplayspokemon is confident that Red
Dead Redemption too will come to PC all
I know is in the I saw that I saw all of
like the stills going around reddit the
other day
no way and how can you flip can you flip
midair I don't think he can do anything
what you've done the dive okay and you
know it said Xbox Playstation 4 you can
you can flip mid dive now dive but mid
jump no problem
I don't know what that means
alle barn hello but barn it's all fine
willow and that's right you know what
and it's great that we're streaming this
because they the debate is open you fell
through a wall
the debate is tonight ow so this is this
is topical rich we're doing some topical
streaming and accidentally accidental
topical streaming nope
whoa they'll say no PC and then do a
delayed PC release sure sure I'm fine
with that as long as it comes out in the
fucking PC and you know what to speak to
your question I know the only thing I
know the only thing I know about moon
night is he's supposed to be the Batman
of the Marvel Universe he's kinda lame
huh he's kind of never read them I've
never read any moon night wait I thought
this is the debate Oh cuz always that's
I made in China one of the heads sake
huh make America great again of course
sorry T great yep that's great that's
great
that's hilarious Oh video game jump pad
rich where do you see that white square
with the yellow that is a video game
jump pad
best game 2016 nope
best game but you know what really just
I I want to say this was Rich's thought
from a while back when we were talking
about spider-man movies and he said you
know these a lot of these things would
make better TV shows because they're
based off of serial their serials right
they're based off of serials and that's
what they're supposed to be spider-man
specifically or at least more so
hmm do this I have no idea
sorry chances hey guys hope you're doing
well this game was sent for shits and
giggles I really didn't think you'd
stream it but thanks this is freaking
glorious also good job jack hey I'm a
pretty good secret security a Secret
Service agent I mean you know look me up

my favorite game of all time

the tables oh sure
if I was the president what would my
Secret Service
callsign be I'm gonna say I'm gonna say
prickly cactus I don't know what I don't
know why that's just what I'm gonna say
prickly cactus what what that's some
bullshit well yeah um maybe I'm gonna or
maybe grumpy Gus maybe my name would be
grumpy Gus
because as president I want presidents
as far as I know aren't allowed to
really drink so you know I'd be sober
all the time and just pissed off there's
anything illegal president drinking yeah
I think it's frowned upon straight
straight straight shooter Oh
get there get there get there
oh oh oh
rich my favorite stand-up comedians
tersh Carlin fresh Pryor Steve Martin
Steve Martin is the greatest not for
stand-up so much he's latest I love this
stand-up and you know what I know he's a
horrible rapist now but I really liked
Bill Cosby stand of that horrible rapist
Bill Condon yeah I liked it I liked it
I'm told good stories and I like the
stories that he told oh I did I did what
I didn't pull the jack yeah yeah you get
so used to hitting that off yeah
oh yeah you can't move the mouse at all
and those confined spaces not a huge fan
of Doug Stanhope Stanhope our team says
name-o
I mean there's a lot of stand-up comedy
that I like but you know like favorite
of all time it's just George Carlin by
like a mile and a half like it's not
even it's not even close mm-hmm and for
me it's Steve Martin like them in movies
stand up yeah
oh I like them it's fine I liked him he
got weird with it sometimes it's kind of
what I don't like about it right nope
nope nope also brilliant came to me
thanks just this guy you know yeah you
know perfect now hit two not oh yeah I
know I know rich we'll get some we'll
get some sweet pics of the painted PC as
soon as he's done with it
nor have we checked out civilization six
nope I'm not
oh so close let's see here
knee get says do each of you have a
favorite movie from the past decade Oh
close fall favorite movie from the pan
that max fury road you know what that's
a nice easy one I'll say that too
because it's you know what it's a great
movie easy well that's just that's just
the answer I mean what's a great movie
better you know what I have not seen it
since it came out wait what is going on
here
there he is how he found it oh oh he's
up there what are you doing up there
oh he look he falls into a giant vat of
Chinese food by the way you have to do a
flip over it
look at that giant vat of Chinese food I
think I know what to do
I know what to do
all right that works yep
all right I can't get over this thing
do just that do you have to dive over no
no me ah dr. doom it up hi jack watch
all episodes of puplic NPI yesterday and
could not fathom what I was looking at
you're welcome you're welcome dr. doom
it up could you explain the thought
behind it lol make me a sandwich
the original idea which I don't think I
did perfectly was I just wanted to was I
wanted to make little snippets of a
detective show but you know have the
detective poop in his pants I like
that's it and so I what I tried to do is
is like think of what the talking or
what the well what the points of a
detective show would be you know like oh
the crime is here like the cops don't
want detective involved there's a big
twist and and he's caught and and then I
just tried to make it them short enough
where we could get a decent poop joke in
there but you know I don't think it
worked great I still like I still
overall like it though mostly because he
says poop again what is poop again and
you know the joke is his name is poop
again but but poop again you know like
he pooped again we all get it do you get
it
we all get it pray say it loud I'm black
and I'm proud
baby baby baby PS I'm not black I'm just
all jazzed up because psvr has me
excited again to play video games even
the most simplistic games are
amazing I'm glad you're enjoying it
PlayStation VR a lot of people upset
that we didn't suck the arse cock yeah
yeah Paulo I mean but you know we're not
we're just not into the whole thing and
ooh that's close that's closer wait
we'll wait for the games and we'll see
but I'm glad you're enjoying it that's
that's you know I'm excited for you
because it is nice to ingest enjoy
things in general I thank you can you
hit the the thing that he trips over can
you hit those planks of No
oh you can Oh crouch under the bar with
the C button oh oh if we forgot about
Crouch yes once we've had to use it nope
yeah maybe okay the controls aren't
necessarily refined
I'm guessing this was a game made in a
very short manner nope this is a game
made for very cheaply very quickly so
the controls aren't necessarily great oh
whoa oh oh you might have done it you
might have done it I'm saved
whoo American jobs from evil communists
way to go
yeah bad news and choose the price of VR
is a little too expensive the
accessibility the convenience the
functionality like the VR has right has
yet to say he's a fucking dedicated room
and and you know
oh so close
a show closed
well all the VR stuff so far is
stationary right right I oh nice it is
upsetting though when you deflect the
bullet that you don't splatter yeah I
think that would be nice just seamlessly
this happens do you kick things
John Elway's teeth says I have a friend
who has a rift and an oculus they're fun
to try but after a couple hours the
novelty is gone that's what I would
assume as someone who wears something on
his face all the time
Oh neat look at that I can't imagine I
can't imagine long gaming sessions in VR
with a giant thing strapped to your head
jackets the best thing ever is gonna
revolutionize life and I don't want to
die anymore because the VR you're right
you're right its future its future it's
the future oh you were there
I think rogue one looks good I didn't
even watch the new trailer Oh neither of
I like I don't really look fine I don't
care about it like I'm not it might be
might be better than the force awakens
could be might be worse who knows they
you know they did a good job with the
force awakens did you're adequate gem
and but one is not a trend you know just
because they did one right doesn't mean
they're gonna do the other but that's
horseshit the blue floor
can you just dive over the statue why do
you have to go I didn't hit the arm huh
I hit the arm okay oh pardon me
gesundheit
now cast us that doesn't make any sense
so I'm not gonna answer that that's what
I'm that's what I'm gonna say do you
know yeah there you go that's the fun
part
Marvel agents of shield just tied Ghost
Rider to Doctor Strange last night that
is exciting you know what oh this so far
this season of agents of shield hasn't
been terrible Oh hasn't been great but
it hasn't been as terrible oh nice nice
nice one rich I was really worried after
that season premiere that they were
going to do something
that it was gonna be worse but it's been
alright agents of shield this season
Supergirl has been off the fucking hook
though man I'm super into Supergirl this
season there's only like there only like
two episodes in and it's great
it's fun it's exciting she's a real hero
Superman is in it and he's a real hero
it's great it's all sorts of fun oh so
I'm super into Supergirl now that it's
on this aw I'm a little upset that it's
not in the arrowverse oh nice thank you
flash is already a mess this season yeah
yeah
they're starting to mess with time and
the multiverse and yeah they started
getting into time travel and now that's
that's Flash
but you know what also just in general
like the whole CW now has has an app for
like Apple TV and stuff that's that's
just there shows like that you can sure
you can do it put your back into it but
your back into it
and it's it's something that every
single we'll get into grand finale
territory here I think yeah it's
something that I think every TV channel
needs which is just a dedicated app
where I don't need to watch their shit
live on TV or be bothered with a DVR or
anything like that so I'm really
enjoying the app that the CW has it's
free you don't need to like log in with
your cable provider it's just their free
app and they run ads on it and it's
great it's super super great yeah Eero
kind of sucks now - but arrow kind of
always sucked so you know what are you
gonna get into nothing you're gonna
watch it because it's sleazy and there's
sexy people in it
the sections kind of bullshit I just
want you to know yeah kind of bullshit
no not for the CW app you do not need a
cable package you don't need to login or
anything you just need Internet and they
don't have their entire back catalogue
of shows but they have the the last few
episodes so if you meant you know if you
missed it last night
Supergirl you can watch it and it's it's
a great app it's a really really
fantastic oh no you were there are the
ads are they repetitive and irritating
sometimes they have the same ads but
it's not like the exact same ad over and
over again it's it's you know they have
a variety of ads so it's and good
quality you know the show streaming high
quality and it's it's nice I'm a big fan
as someone who watches arrow and flash
and Supergirl and that's about it on the
CW I keep hearing good things about
crazy ex-girlfriend but I watch a couple
episodes and do much care for it but
that means nothing to me what you just
said oh I know her because she used to
make youtube videos and she's she's very
funny overly attached girlfriend crazy
ex-girlfriend Oh what's bullshit
what legends of tomorrow I watched a
couple episodes and it sucked so hard
I heard it's not so bad now but it's
so hard don't they're saying don't jump
let the ramp drop first just bump into
it and then maybe and then you can like
oh shit I had to come on guy
come on guy I don't know know if well I
guess it kind of rips off overly
attached girlfriend but it's just based
off of oh please the girl who's in it
it's just based off of her
like YouTube the YouTube videos that she
made and it's like a musical show and so
she sings songs but it's not overly
attached girlfriend someone else it's
crazy ex no it's not it's not the
actress overly attached girlfriend it's
but it's an act it's an actress and
comedian who has done good work as far
as YouTube videos are concerned ripping
off the bit of another YouTube celebrity
I don't I don't think they're ripping
off overly attached girlfriend oh you
did it
I hit reset because I assumed I didn't
do it but you did it nope nope so far
rich what have you enjoyed more Gears of
War 4 campaign or its online versus mode
yeah as pros and cons to each huh I
think I've played the multiplayer more
cuz the campaign is just pretty dull oh
wait can I do it again I think you would
have gotten it again
all right oh my god
yeah I know you know I haven't delved a
ton into the multiplayer but so far the
campaign has been very dull and the
other day I did pick up Gears of War 1
here just to like see if it was
nostalgia that made me remember that it
was good or if it actually is good and
it's good like it's better it's
significantly better now watch
oh this thing that's into it I still
think that your best bet is to just run
into it it'll fall down and then you
won't
Wow huge war has always looked dull you
know the first year's game I stand
behind first shoe even the second one
yeah but there's some fun in there I
remember too even being a better
campaign no no oh I don't remember I
don't remember too that much I'll stand
by the originals I never I never played
three but I will stand by the originals
I haven't either which tells you how
much I love the fridges but it's decent

that fuckin soldier in the face jacket
and he's fine like right and it went
down his mouth excuse me oh oh there you
go I'm the president now got real have I
gotten any roles in movies besides red
letter media I'm not I'm not like a
professional actor I'm in red letter
media stuff because these are my good
friends the closest I came was actually
poop again pee I because I didn't really
know Jack very well all the time
that's true first time I met you was
when we did feeding frenzy and you were
playing my dead son my zombie son and I
don't know what the hell made you wanna
cast me as the the the the sheriff was
that the sheriff was the like the
detective like the police chief yeah but
you said that much evidence he's got
something I'm gonna hire him oh oh when
I say yes to an honor on offer what are
they what are they offering rich works
for money
yeah knowing you know when I when I cast
you in poop again like I had seen you in
in you know what he's gonna fall onto
the spikes now you're both gonna fall
the spikes I think you need to hit him
from the side and knock him off of the
stairs I had assumed that you were local
yeah no no when I was still living up in
Chicago at that time right and so I cast
you thinking like oh yeah Jay might have
worked with him he's local that I can
get it I can get and so I and then I had
found a way afterwards that you are that
you were you know came up from Chicago
just yep just to be in poop again is
great which is great
I believe I can fly I barely knew you at
the time to be fair and did give me an
opportunity to come up and just visit oh
sure sure
can you what happens if you just jump
and land on the stairs under something
you can't be up right yeah yeah you
cannot walk correct down the stairs take
this here wait take this take this
patiently yeah run to the side of the
stairs don't jump on the stairs right
now we got time
and then like like like come at it from
there and push him off that way okay
thought you might have gotten the offer
to star on other projects not
necessarily a Woody Allen film uh no
I've had a couple people ask you to
voice work but I've agreed
yeah their only child sigh hey guys what
are your thoughts on Superman Returns
2006 Brendan Roth was good and it got
good reviews but never a ton of love
it's also kind of refreshing now
considering current DC movies Superman
Returns is the other extreme if Man of
Steel is Superman fries you know like
those laser vision yeah
Superman Returns of Superman cries yeah
they went they went a little too like I
think they got a lot right in Superman
yeah but but they also like I think it
was Kevin Smith who famously said if you
look at Superman Returns
it's a Superman movie in which Superman
doesn't throw a single punch and you
know you kind of need some action in
your action movie they were they were
going for something there we go I think
you did it
his hair is still on yep oh I know how
to CC Brittany 1 3 3 says hello burden
Ernie
any videos coming out soon I would
assume there is a wheel of the worst or
half in the bag coming soon have a good
rest of the week fuckos aides they just
wanted to hear me say aids so they wrote
that in there yes probably a couple yeah
this is a short short little thing we
filmed yesterday and
there's there's usually a Halloween half
in the bag I mean not half of the bagman
the best of the worst there's usually
Halloween best of the worst yeah usually
usually oh my god look at this they're
all being waterboarded how horrifying is
this game
there might be two best of the worst
this month
oh one you got we actually filmed a
while ago yeah yeah we filmed that when
the Canadians were it was filmed at the
same time filled like the day before
after that that we loved the worst with
Jim and Colin only you know Mike was the
one who added that episode but he was
busy working on the mr. blinken review
so that one got pushed off aways so
there might be a Halloween episode of
best of the worst coming up you have
time to jump up the front of that
normally like not there but like the
front where look so you can actually
might be able to climb No
if I can touch that I can shoot Trump
that's what you need to do yeah but I
can't do at the time you just need to
kind of closer but you're not you're
turning away too late you gotta hug the
edge of that thing you gotta hug the
edge of all this shit great yeah yeah
- you can you get them close you're
getting close I think I think that's the
wind I think that's what to do
now get hugging the edge of that yellow
shit - I think almost
why does it take so long to make best of
the worst worst is it the editing since
I imagined just watching three movies
and talking 'litham for an hour
shouldn't take long
well they take a full day to film hour
and a half per movie so you got like
close to five hours just for watching
the films
plus there's gonna be a break in there
for food so well like six and a half
hours to watch the movies Oh at least
and then the setting up should have the
discussion which doesn't happen
instantly right so you know I like like
at least eight hours it's usually longer
than that because we can talk for two
hours oh yeah and so then when when
they're editing it not only do they kind
of have to watch the movies to find
clips and movies that you don't think I
like they're like five then I have five
hours worth of movies just to rewatch
and pick out clips and then they had
five hours of our reaction to go through
and pick out clips and then there's two
hours of discussion to edit I am NOT an
editor but I have been told by them
multiple times that it is the most
difficult thing they do oh I would
believe it
cuz it's not just editing just that the
talking the video it's like we're sound
mixing mixing the mics so once it was
talking over Jatin you know rich is
talking over Jay you gotta bring riches
financing here Jay is saying all that
all that shit the syncing there you
gonna yeah you have to sync the footage
of us on the couch with the movie which
is done with a mirror when when we sit
down on the couch to watch the movie
when the move when we hit play in the
movie Jay gets up he holds a mirror in
front of the camera so he can see the
movie in the mirror and he waits so
there's an edit in the movie and we can
sync them that way
high-tech stuff high-tech
hi high-tech stuff now we do not take
notes as we do it nope
yeah no we don't we don't take notes we
just try to remember we remember what's
fine we've remembered what's funny oh
yeah
so-and-so said the funny thing why is
there a sausage you did it that was
great
Jason could car abs is my boyfriend I
just watched all of the Grabowski x' and
he felt compelled to recreate this
poster doesn't link oh dear God
thank you thank you
that's all I can say to that
oh did he fall off the tables or
something did he get up
yeah yeah oh yeah these are slim jims
you're right
these are absolutely slim jims not it
what says rich are basically the fall
guy of the group obviously it's all in
good fun and you guys are all buds but
does it ever really bother you do you
ever want to give Mike shit about his
Wendy's head all the time
all the goddamn time
it's kind of slightly repetitive are you
talking about the game because well da I
mean this game was obviously put
together real quick as a joke and you
know what we're having fun with it
my looks might look repetitive to you
but we're actually having fun yeah
there's there's like a lot of like
decent merits to this game I'm kind of
breaking it here
why can't you just jump over the sausage
because it's not working great like I
can't do that because then you overshoot
well you don't have to dive you can just
land on him just jump on there literally
off the edge oh hey that works
well
I thought we wouldn't get 30 minutes out
of this hour and a half really which
with it's 7:27 that's crazy I I mean
it's it's a very fun game oh I tried to
go fancy rich this this game does have
better puzzles than Uncharted before
because charted before doesn't have
puzzles nope
mr. Frodo the only the only person I
know who is voting Trump is is my
deranged damn
yeah then again everybody I know hasn't
told me who they're voting for
so doom it up says hi rich have you ever
read a philip k dick novel and if so any
recommendations I recently finished the
man in the high castle
it was played the Amazon TV adaptation
sucks though Karen is quite fond of the
Amazon adaptation it was fine yeah
there's nobody to root for everyone's a
jerk yeah yeah yeah it was fine it's a
really great premise kind of not done
great as far as books no not really I
started to read Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep and just kind of lost me
Jack have you ever read and philip k
dick nope
that's definitely Oh luck it's Putin
mr. president is he in the box
is he on top of push too
the thing in the floor it says push -
push - you got a you got a show the
thing was he up top there Wow
oh I guess he's up there yeah I have to
get on the other side of this thing
here's what you owe to block the shot
yeah
clever what haven't they done that
before
anonymous says when Mike gets bleeped
uncensored is he really saying something
horrific or just for comedic effect I'll
see you guys should try out goat
simulator it's like this except you're a
goat
I've heard of goat simulator but I think
this is a lot more appropriate right now
can you let one hit pupil yeah I
remember when goat simulator came out
and I saw some videos on it I was like
oh oh you know I got it like I get this
too but yeah this seems like it's
appropriate for for the world at the
moment
what do you knock over and goat
simulator anything or you just flip
around just for fun nope you just go do
you do goat stuff you can go and do
stuff and yeah there are like little
game elements to it too like you know
they say ya bounce on the trampoline 100
feet yeah you get achievement there'd be
a goat
chikka MooMoo says good evenin gentlemen
if you ran for office
what would your platform be we've
already discussed this I already have a
platform fix I became sort of didn't
stop zombie games
yeah we're accurately prohibition on all
zombie games maybe to fix Mass Effect 3
have it redone also to shut down EA
games I think would be a big part of my
presidential platform yeah yeah
nice no that one's getting through maybe
that one's just for me
almost jack almost
anonymous says check and rich you guys
feeling the burn this year and no not
that burn lol Snoodle my noodle what's
hot this summer yes out this summer and
was like we're getting a weird fall now
where it's like warm somedays and it's a
warm winter and you know summers a
little bit warmer than usual yeah that
was nice yeah wasn't all bad shit
it wasn't all bad
Oh
oh damn it because you know now they're
having me press the button that you
press to go to the next chapter to do a
thing I'm pressing R out of
out of habit but it's to to push
I was in Phoenix once and it just
happened to be during a heatwave yeah I
think was a hundred and freakin twenty
like ten years ago now or something
weird like that but always it hot
the master 20 thousands us rich stop
blaming ei for me3 demin the good writer
left after 1 & 2 was just sci-fi schlock
at that point no I still say to had a
lot of good points it it had some great
characters was it had some great world
building the main story is relatively
weak but they were focusing on the
characters was the whole point from the
beginning who was fine it does start to
turn into a little bit of schlock but
not in any way that ruins the series
like silly things like their the wearing
just breathing mass out and like a
vacuum and not dying like shit like that
but
- from a gameplay perspective and a
world building perspective is much
better than one one is a great main
story 3 yet
terrible writer I'm sure EA didn't help
EA wanted them to shove that thing on
the door in two years that game probably
needed at least five years to really be
decent though with with with Katie Casey
Hudson suddenly thinking he was some
kind of avant-garde art master didn't
help things
god damn game rich yeah just about done
do you see financial similarities
between big Hollywood movie companies
and big game companies in the sense that
they have comical budgets comical
budgets that are way bigger than they
should be and they need to make like
three times the national debt in order
to be considered a success yeah in that
sense there's a similarity
novices no you fools not heat Bernie
Sanders one of his campaign slogans was
feel the Bern as in Bernie Sanders slob
on my goddamn knob you hack frauds I
think you're mispronouncing Colonel
Sanders
the Kentucky Fried Chicken guy yeah yeah
look at the colonel we remember the new
colonel is really I like Norm Macdonald
they replaced Daryl Hannah Daryl not
Terrell Hannah Daryl Daryl Hannah would
be an interesting choice I want to say
he was one of them Daryl Hannah isn't a
he who's that one Daryl Hannan Daryl
Hannah is an actress who's the guy on
Saturday Night Live Daryl Hannan Daryl
hey sure sure
and and now they have Jim Gaffigan
Darrell Hammond Hammond Thank You Chad
game child UK says so aside from the
debate tonight election night and is
just under three weeks from now even if
you don't like Hillary is it safe to say
there is definitely one candidate you'd
rather have than the other I don't plan
on voting for either candidate if I if I
can't get behind the candidate I'm not
doing that
lesser of two evils bullshit I am if the
country gets fucked as a result of that
I our political system for being as
fucked up as it is right now
yeah trumps just so much worse that's
your business you can vote for you up to
and you know what it's not gonna bother
me good vote for whoever you want to
jack great
right
fucking great there's no everyone wants
to pretend like well I pretend it is it
is a wasted vote voting for a third
party but they're missing the greater
point that this country needs a stronger
third and or fourth party
oh no I agree we need it and you know
it's never gonna happen if they never
get votes the the only problem you know
as far as I see it is currently the
third party candidates are dickheads
look at though they're both incompetent
yeah and so it's like for this time it's
not like a wasted you know like you're
throwing your vote away it's just like
no these two people are dickheads you
know get some better candidates up there
Jill Stein is wishy washy she panders
too crazy
yep what's his name Gary Johnson yeah he
would he would he's just too extreme on
the libertarianism but he's not like
have you seen interviews with him where
they're like well you know what this you
have a libertarianism is really extreme
can you really defend getting rid of the
Department of Education and then it goes
down bleep on they said we probably
won't I said oh no I hear What did he
say he said if if an institution works
then we'll keep it it's just the hitch
is the fact that when they asked him
what what what departments when you get
rid of he listed like the partner of
Education there was a whole bunch of
things like we can't get rid of that
yeah that's insane is insane
this level I'm pretty sure is impossible
I'm gonna say that this level is
impossible rich I don't think regardless
of who you blame for the broken system
you are failing in your duty oh it's my
duty now to elect to scroll down you're
saying too many things chat saying too
many things and I can't read things the
best choice the best possible choice
that you have
no I lesser of two evils I'm not doing
it and if everyone felt that way it
would stop happening it's my duty to try
and make the system better and you don't
do that by doing the same things that
are wrong with the system you know third
party candidates needs to concentrate on
smaller elections they need to
concentrate on Congress and the Senate
where they're where their presence will
actually make a difference but the you
know the the other problem third party
candidates is they only come out of the
woodwork during presidential elections
yeah it's like let's let's have them do
something they can't win but at the very
least a a strong showing for a third
party candidate would a big strong a
message that you know this needs to
change and you know what I like I agree
with you but I think your point is moot
here because as we've discussed the two
major third party candidates are
dickheads right well they all are I'm
not gonna
no and you know what as far as it's your
duty to vote I think it's perfectly
except except about to cast your vote as
a non vote
yeah like no I my vote is nothing I
think you know that's perfectly
acceptable
this isn't apathy it's a guy whatever no
this is I don't want to vote for these
people right no and I think that's fair
I think that's absolutely fair
I disagree you know like as far as you
know lesser of two evils blah blah blah
but no friction isn't one of Oh he does
intend to vote if you don't want to vote
you don't have to vote
mal castus says do you experience in the
US that if you don't vote people say
you're not entitled to complain about
the politicians yeah they say that but
their opinion is worth it absolutely
nothing you just ignore that shed
yeah and you know as far as that feeling
the burn is concerned I saw I saw that
thing that hopefully everybody saw which
is uh Paul Ryan in Wisconsin night Paul
Ryan giving a speech at a conservative
dinner saying you know do you know what
happens if the if the Senate goes
Democrat Bernie Sanders becomes chair of
the house fuck you game or Bernie
Sanders becomes in charge of like all
the money they spend in the Senate and I
was like woo that's a fun idea let's
make that happen which is basically like
basically Paul Ryan just handed the
Senate all the campaign advertisers the
Democrats all the campaign adverts that
they need this scan that's good thanks
Santa's this game is so fucking broken
that I hate it gobbledygook says
gobbledygook California always goes to
the Democrats
so I write in a vote every election rich
if you wrote in a name for fun who would
it be
ha ha ha Karen Mike DC Universe Online
rich rich is uh we're gonna write in DC
Universe Online make America free you
fucks like that
no I you know what I not I'm not writing
in yeah well unless you can't vote for a
third party candidate here even though
they won't win and even though I really
I genuinely don't like either of them
yeah I think if you get like a third
party candidate for a without with a
strong showing that says a lot that says
a lot about where we are now and I think
that itself might be important it would
be if the either of the people running
were worth anything you know well then
yeah but they're not gonna win oh
they're not worth anything no no but you
know remember cuz it's not just about
the party it's also about the person I
think you're gonna have in this election
I think you're having a lot of people
who are voting for Donald Trump because
they're Republicans and they say well
I'm a Republican I'm gonna vote for the
Republican it's like you know sometimes
you have to vote for the / or you know
always you always have to vote for the
person and so like saying that like I'm
gonna vote third party because that will
make a strong showing for third party
ignores the fact that you're also voting
for the person hmm and and you know like
then Gary Johnson can put all this shit
yes Donald mousetrap says after our
country is inevitable socio-economic
collapse
can we make the rlm studio into a
fortress in all worship bad movies no
we're gonna be dependent defending this
place with assault rifles you can't get
in nope
assault rifles yeah I guess that is true
about Ross Perot he got all he got a
