right now or nothing you've seen some
shit or you're seeing nothing anyway
while we're talking about press relocker
press you're like are you familiar what
the pressure looks candled that happened
the press here looks that sounds like a
made-up thing no back in the day there
was a guy who was apparently he watchdog
pressure luck obsessively okay and he
recognized a pattern in the board so he
could tell what squares were gonna be
hit when know this guy managed to get on
the show uh-huh
and he literally could not lose cuz he
knew how to play the board Oh every turn
he got 5,000 spent he walked out with
like over a hundred thousand dollars
from one episode mommy and there was
nothing that Network could do about it
cuz he didn't cheat technically right
let me get a goodnight we won't know
okay

older game shows stream that game shows

spectacular they might be spectacular
this might be spectacular does that mean
we got some watch Oh
okay guys watch game stand back
oh I skip the cutscene what how do you
get the stars
how do you hit the stars
stay down no one here I don't think he's
gonna get back up I am exciting must
have been off that was pretty awesome my
timing was up that should have a
knockout fun yeah
so wait yeah what a three-star punch
right when he comes back not sure it's
an instant oh okay
how do you earn a star it's different
yep likely discovered it's different for
different characters usually a counter
punch will do it like right there
instead sometimes you hit one to do with
your talk okay they're flashing yellow
oh I'm gonna stars come with me I'm with
you but that should have been you should
have been down in 10 SEC's I did not
you're still gonna be the wrong one oh

everyone there's no way that I can be
that impressive yes super punch-out is
the fun I'm not sure which one I like
better if I make this more than that
super punch-out that was that was really
impressive great yeah I don't know I
don't know what to say about that I
don't know if I'd sure been more
impressive it was shit a bit more
impressive I should have had him down in
like ten seconds or something ridiculous
practice why does this hit prac oh

playing I made it all the way to great
time okay
not without going down once okay
someone's saying Jack you better not
lose to this tool I'll try to yeah yeah
disco kids a tool listen I think if you
lose in the first couple around in the
first couple of Fighters then yeah then
you got some problem
just one looks to be in decent shape but
the kids down help me help go help you
know you should stop people here it
comes

weird mike tyson's things oh yeah that's
that's a fantastic day like that yeah oh
yeah thank you what was it recently
where he was on there like a talk show
started insulting the host well because
the the host was just like I mean you're
a convicted rapist which is true it's
very true but you know maybe not the
thing to talk about when you're you know
in front of Mike Tyson is running for
office it's a legitimate question
oh is that what nothing is right from
Mayor of some toned isn't he I thought
it was for like a show of one minute
wrong many of Rome is okay Chad is Mike
Tyson running for public office because
if so who the fuck would vote for him

fall down I don't know if I should tell
you no don't tell me I think everybody
gotta like hit him in the stomach or
something it was it's been a while

and she just makes animal noises yes I
kind of love it okay there you go there

fascinating story which usually happens
under control
I remember this no this is all for now

know it like this is not gonna knock him
down soon slow way to do things I'm sure
there's a better way

acceptable cutscene fucking candy bar
that's not helping me
rich what was that movie called that
played at the end of the hour when
stream last Christmas it was about an
old man and I'm pretty sure it was made
by the visionaries that did that bust it
was and it actually was called old man
the movie about the old man is called
old man and nobody look up this movie
find that anymore anyway it's it's it's
the worst movie possible it's so
terrible you have no idea just why we
streamed it being people who watch bad
movies on purpose that one smell ones
tariffs nubile smoogle those the Mogu
leg didn't use good news when they made
a fake oh man it's the worst
I have you know what I have not seen
death list no no you don't need to you
know I've seen no if it's anything like
old man fucking I'm trying to think of I
can't man whoops subhype riches their
sub height what are people subscribing
yes somebody's saying some hype I don't
I don't see these things when they
happen I'm weird cover wise we just
subscribed done thank you
reusable to shout out but I'm I'm slow
on the draw here I didn't see would have
done that
thanks for subscribing sirico activism
thanks for subscribing quick shots of
tales cocktails I've been reading this
cute is cute cutie does he'll take qix
as kilo I think right I don't know in
any case Kyoto tales or glass hotels
thank you for subscribing
don't you subjected the streamers I'm
Adam dick I just met my intentions on
Jack in the game I'm just not good at
keeping up with a chat I'm just a good
rich you have one job who keep up the
chat and you all saw an entertainment if
you have two jobs
I'm to entertain by watching you
I was close with the name just pushing
that means I'm supposed to the new one
okay cool I'm getting my ass handed to
me straight up that's right I am dizzy
rushing check fellas he's not tailed yet
so far he's doing fine does that help
god dammit I never said you don't matter
can take care you matter just fine you
can block yep
I don't Bowl huh you just hold up guard
your face piston honda has this unlock
down that's what they're saying they're
about to see what's gonna happen oh this
is the turnaround this is rocky moment
this is the rocky Wow rocky you know
learn on rock Vegas there's one thing I
learned by watching you I see don't be
stressed Rocky is a fucking terrible his
strategy is to get hit in the face as
much as humanly possible yeah and
eventually his opponent will get tired
log hitting him in the face it's no
wonder he has fucking brain damage by
the later movies
okay okay here we go okay here we go
here we go
jack is like Klingon warrior he thinks
blocking was cowardly why would they use
cloaking technology that seems to be
against everything they'd normally stand
for you think they'd be like poking this
for weaklings yes we fight you
straight-up wasn't the thing without
Honda or like when he charged that you
punch you in the stomach
the timing is perfect just every time
you have the time they all up I give my
first knocking gone that's okay rematch
rematch rematch baby yeah I've had lunch
one of the running movie company you do
some play and I just expected to see
this great box an absolute defend abouts
and I was so disappointed with that
because it is just him getting punched
in the face
Rocky's such a great movie you are a
loose dog did you just hit him when he
was bowing at once oh well I was dog is
that one
it's done yeah sure how about very been
here another three times got the
cloaking technology
the Romulans the biggest then what they
shouldn't use it at all they should be
just against me
Rocky's a great movie I just want to
make sure people understand that Jesus
oh my get this I might get this you know
whose timing is all kinds of fuck now I
have so much fun with dub the bulrush
yeah yeah window above all else's
stupidity but the Klingons are all about
stupidity and honor
yeah that's kind of their trademark um I
guess the question is like cleanings
feel that running away is is bad form
yeah but hiding is just part of the hunt
so like if if they would cloak to escape
a battle absolutely then that's bullshit
but I could see them having the cloaking
technology to hide and ambush someone
yeah it still never sit right with me
though I believe your life so heavily on
cloaking technology
oh look at this guy bear hugger
yeah yeah yeah bear hugger what what
rich what did you think about the beta
sentence no there there everyone but
they never did much with the Betazoids
betas heads whatever Troy let's hurry
with it with a new comparison people
know Oh trollee
who's the site there whose long as a
parasite where'd you get the collar on
third trip trips the trip oh the
Betazoids no they never did anything
good and any episode with
any episodes with Troy's another where
the fucking slog really he's beat got
you I noticed yeah Jack you need to
embrace the duck he's got real things
for the later guy for the tree off its
timing yes it's just that one like this
what that one just fat the bear hug
dogs of court yeah you're right what did
I bench also wait wait for the red flash
that's the red fire one a question
there's what I that's usually grapes I
think the controls are bullshit that the
show never really dealt with how fucked
up the whole Scindia relationship is
with anything I can agree with that I
guess I don't have strong feelings about
it but I can agree with that it's it's
consensual though I mean the people want
fucking Symbian so you know what I did
not watch much deep space 9 I got really
part of this mission there was one
episode that had a truck doctor pressure
fell in love with the guy
oh he was true have any got injuries and
then they quit the trail and a woman's
body and she couldn't deal with that
that's right that's a good episode
yeah you know that's a fine episode but
no what am I thinking of in deep space
then track track sir next major yeah
yeah Jeff Zients death farm alert
formulated Kazon - there's an old man
who's friends with Cisco get my is it
watch me how I do it no no no I'll do
that runs away I'm training like a
Chinese master or ancient guy and I'm
repellant I saw yes very good
