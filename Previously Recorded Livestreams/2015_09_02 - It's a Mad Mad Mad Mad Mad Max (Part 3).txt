devious suckling face oh look at this
guy he's a crazy Oh dead a dozen times
if you do boy we've come to deal sorry
guys
cutscene I like that I enjoy people
praying to car gods
I think it's wonderfully ridiculous
hands of a black finger yes
sorry there's no one chance for me
thanks thanks me thanks Pete
you can get Mad Max not rageous hermit
beard by the way okay yeah yeah I mean
so we definitely should yeah there are
various stages of hair oh you're Smeagol
I don't want to be in here
what's wrong with there good do shit and
fight people jump in the car all right
sorry Smeagol let's go oh maybe there's
something I got to do in here I'll
follow the green dot or something you
gonna fight people you don't want to
drove here not me I thought I thought I
was gonna replace to fight people I
thought I was going to another gang
hideout I'm sorry this isn't fighting
people I get the door well we'll find a
gang hideout it'll be fine it'll be fine
fine we'll punch people
Chet Red Dead Redemption is a pretty
damn good open world I'm still gonna say
it's the second best because kind of
like this most of it is just open area
and you know it's great for what it is
it makes you feel like you're in the
Wild West that's a great thing but I
mean when you consider how much shit is
jam-packed into the san andreas map the
detail they put into that amazing yeah
welding where oh you use the garage to
install the final upgrade for the jack
I got the welding wire Oh
go to the garage hit start menu oh oh I
thought I was like I'm not no no no hit
X that's the and go to the the back back
hit a right this one yeah and then go to
the red thing and you're gonna upgrade
that baby bars baby bars what a baby
bars all right great
Beck I know it's good to flug out of
here
come on Smee go
so now that's kind of like a base that
we can use yeah thanks
my car's a lot of spikes
I think it's hurting me more than
is anyone even in that car check I'm I'm
not talking about the relative merits to
the story in San Andreas for grand theft
auto 5 or any of those we're just
talking about the open world itself and
I will put San Andreas as open world
over grand theft auto 5
it's card handles like ass and that's
not saying Grand Theft Auto five map is
back that's not saying that I'm sure
people are gonna twist my word
what that's ass okay it handles like
absolute ass well I'm sorry but it feels
pretty sorry that you jumped out of your
supercar that your building and into a
random a random mooks car and you're not
happy with the way it handles I'm sorry
yeah that's great he's pretty strong now
so
so feeling good about that whoa
different frying san andreas is pure
nostalgia I'm Iron Man two opinion a
double opinion gameplay is so bad in
comparison again talking about the map
so I got about the map oh wow wow wow
fucked over I had spikes yeah you think
I should've hurt that guy yeah I do
think they should have heard that guy I
guess they might have
and so I like I eased him up in that car
now I can finish him off in my car no
that's that guy
I never got now I can set for fucking
I'm up for realsies
obviously record live do you think the
Queen of England has ever sucked dick
this is something you often think about
her collecting data do you do you have
like a fetish for for elderly royalty
you know what I think that's a fair
question I think I think the proper
answer is it it doesn't matter she's
never sucked a dick and if she did good
for her or good for him
no both will hold yeah yeah hopefully
she did it in some sort of loving
relationship and it was reciprocated
with royal cunnilingus if it wasn't good
for one of them whichever one it was
it's kind of depressing yeah
agree what a strange thing to think
about
oh you're not getting away or maybe you
are oh maybe you're getting away
you might be getting away whoa fuck yep
you're good no I hid her body repair
nope repair repair the older Grand Theft
Auto games had the shittiest plane
controls yeah but who ever played Grand
Theft Auto for the place the planes were
a font we're joke there they're an extra
there are nice planes in Grand Theft
Auto are an extra yes like I thought the
fighter jet handled pretty well in San
Andreas I was indeed ship the jet pack
remember the jet pack okay that was one
of those little details that the senator
has had that was fun
again novelty yeah
I gotta go find out it's crap that I
left behind
Keeney monkey
the craving that ever suck a dick what a
strange trip I know it's just it's on my
brain now and it's like I find it for
curse or something jack ah okay what
time again I have no idea great
can't see a clock because the game's
full screen actually say that I have a
cell phone
that's left lemon yeah I got it
I think the energy transfer coming up a
little bit excellent
whoa that's neat that's neat Oh
oh look he killed his teammate thank you
that's really funny can I take that
scrap way to scrap it Oh daddy's dead a
scrap bet that scrap you don't get much
scrap for killing cars I think it varies
that was like six and seven it was
nothing got him 22 it still may be once
the ones that I knew the one I said
earlier like I wish I could what we
first started yeah but I couldn't get
because I was dry from the buggy yeah
those netted me around like 600 oh so oh
the caravan no nose is the special scrap
car drives now just got like a bunch of
junk pal the back of the car you grab
the whole car or hijack the whole car
take it back to the base
I'm with it how do you feel whether B P
B then B again - yes you can yank
smaller faster if you want to move like
a large thing you just have to like just
hit the gas in the car pull it here yeah
the harpoon is great
you should be using it more I didn't
know how much scrap you have
start baby oh just 180 yeah I spent it
all on spikes oh okay
eleven learned live and learn
well you gave you gave me the F great
options I don't think it's not guys wait
some live and learn I didn't say Jack
your soup but I said live and learn live
and learn
don't give Jack the upgrade options you
didn't know I fix it up does he just
automatically fix it soon yeah that's
great
yeah that's great
I wanted to talk about a little bit my
binding of issac play yep which has now
reached endgame point
I've now beaten all parts of the binding
of issac on hard with all of the
characters I have online okay every
single part boss ref is everything so
it's like there's there's um that game's
got some some staying par with you oh
Jesus grace yeah it really does and so
but now I'm getting to the point
now I'm at a point of the game where it
starts to get a little ridiculous how
you gonna feel if right before you 100%
it
they released like a DLC with words a
new one is coming out by the way after
birth like a deal suit like an honours
is a whole new thing
it's add-on it's all add-on material and
it's yet it's it's going to mean that as
soon as I hundred and ten percent the
game it's going to have more content
so are you like rushing to get the
hundred ten percent beforehand I would
like to have it all done before
afterbirth comes out yeah how long you
got a while I actually don't think it's
coming out next year
oh I of course I'm paying attention to
the development but so there there's one
character I don't have unlocked it and
his name is the lost and the lost
I can only get hit once and so you have
to beat everything on the laws without
getting hit it's a terrible terrible
character but in order to hundred and
ten percent the game you need to you
know defeat everything has the lost but
in order to unlock the lost you need to
do a series of ridiculous very specific
things so like and I don't know the
exact combination I need to look it up
but you need to die as Isaac on the
certain level and then play as a
different character on another level
and then play
and then play and die is a different
character in a different level in a very
specific way
like as Isaac you need to die to a
specific enemy you know yeah and then
the next character you need to go on to
a specific level and follow yourself to
death how would you ever know this is
there any hint there is it you can find
it out all in-game but even the way you
find it out in a game is a little
ridiculous as long as there are as long
as there is a logical way to get there
that's fine
logical I don't know I don't know if
it's logical but there is an in-game way
to find out all of these things but it's
even that is borderline ridiculous
this is kind of who I can drop my oh oh
shit sorry dude sorry about that I
haven't I haven't played around with it
but I think if you're driving that
factions car you might be able to get
like close to their base area without
hurting things
Stu 91 asked earlier do you prefer the
original binding of issac or rebirth
I prefer rebirth only because rebirth
means that I get to play it on my Vita
and I love playing it on my Vita and
that's where 99% of my playing of it has
been and so yeah if it weren't for the
Vita would they be but equal or what do
you mean Vita aside which - oh sure I
still prefer rebirth just it's it's a
lot smoother it was a super pain in the
ass to get the game to run with a
controller on Steam you know it had a
ton of glitches they spent a lot of time
making rebirth the game that Binding of
Isaac was supposed to be in the first
place yeah
are there people on the road who are
enemies in this game yes but not very
many of them oh I can't I mean yeah I've
just been kind of indiscriminately every
now and then you'll see people who like
dying of thirst you can choose whether
or not to give them water oh really yeah
so far they haven't given me anything
either which is funny the kindness of my
own heart you're waiting for that FTL I
don't even know what I don't need it
because like I said in games I like
playing the hero that's not really mad
Maxie Mad Max wouldn't give water to
anybody if I were role-playing it I
wouldn't give a shit he would be
grudgingly give water
who really needed it more than he did
but in in general in games I find
rescuing NPCs to be its own world yes
some fucking goody-goody sucking shit
it's okay to be a goody-goody
and jump there's a thing up here
what's up here what's up here
does it have any impact if you don't
give them water I have no idea actually
no that's not sure the first time I ran
across one of these people I didn't have
any water to give I was out I don't know
nothing anything happened where's the
thing what thing there's a yellow thing
Oh in this area in general there are
things dilute No so summer this is there
usually not this barren this is weird I
wonder if there's something under here
yeah like if there's a cave or something
yeah this is too weird usually an area
in areas with that that's square that
icon there's like some kinda
fortifications or building or ruins or
something sure to loot it's never been
nothing before but you have to hold it
down if you want to replenish more yeah
I just made it okay just need a little
sip II just need a it's okay
Gangotri says I save NPCs that's why I
don't donate to charities only only
in-game charities where there's a
possibility of great rewards given that
the only really the only reason I ever
give NPCs water or help them out anyway
is thinking that there's some sort of
being game benefit that's yeah that's
horrible I play I play the game I play
the game rich I'm looking I'm looking
for that like you know you get you give
it to ten of them and they say yes you
have proved your worth have this shotgun
upgrade means nothing to you when the
guy in the game pleads please save my
wife please and then you go save the
wife when you know they get to be
reunited does not does nothing for you
fucking someone drew that yeah like that
yeah all art is is somebody drew that
yeah stories it's fiction fictional
stories you've met you're low on health
you need some Megas there you know eat
the maggots
hmm I'm eating melons here this is how
my little shit I give about the peasants
asking for water I'm eating maggots they
can eat maggots - oh God we got scrap
whoo nice scrap oh we got some scrap now
like 300 scrap
like this dune buggy
I'm driving it really well tea
have you guys seen how minecraft crater
notch is breaking down on Twitter these
days I I haven't heard about Twitter
breakdowns I've heard after selling
minecraft for two billion dollars he's
very sad and lonely I'll take his money
and he can be poor and happy I just want
I want notch I want you to know that
offers on the table buddy I'll take all
of your money I'll take as much as you
want to give me hmm I mean if not a few
bucks for lunch okay
I could I could give two shits here's
here's the wonderful thing what's that
here's the wonderful thing about like
Twitter or any of that is like you don't
week burn trek it's like you don't need
to watch any of that or listen to any of
it you don't need to follow anybody
turn it off who cares if he's freaking
out on Twitter or something made
minecraft good for him think you'd feel
lonely when you build like a giant empty
house you know
no it didn't hear about him feeling
lonely didn't hear about Twitter
meltdowns whatever the fuck he's doing I
don't give a fuck
hold giant parties full of people who
don't know you just know you as the guy
who made the game and who has money and
you shocked you don't have any real
friends
have you doing some wrong I'm sure he
could give two shits it's gonna money I
just want to throw up when you're rich
people complaining about big to rich
where did you hear this that he's
complaining I read like an article of
this okay I don't care that notch has
been very unhappy since he's sold
minecraft for two billion dollars don't
care even a little bit I see a ramp I'm
gonna go off a sweet Ram
like I don't want to go by those
windmills are those anything
rich hmm those windmills anything what
wouldn't else find me
well I can see that yeah behind you yeah
I've given you that thing you're talking
about which is behind the screen that
I'm looking at I've not done anything
with the window yet so I don't know
okay I'm gonna no one knows those things
oh yeah I have no idea
I never seen those before great that's
what I'm gone then guys a little burnt
out so let's hope I can do it without
the car
whoo whoo I know but here's he's the
only literally the only thing I have to
say about Minecraft his children love it
and I've been trying to keep my kids
away from it for as long as humanly
possible because I know it will take
over their lives
it's like Lego but a video game it's
like Lego but a video it's like Lego
it's like unlimited Legos cuz like Legos
you need more of them to build shit
right but in a video game you just you
do there already and my my seven year
old is filing to the point where he
understood like his friends play
minecraft and like he gets it like he
wants minecraft and I'm like okay I'll
wait till it goes in say Ellen you know
find me to find one they don't make it
for a Wii U which I found find strange
nobody oh yeah you're right nobody likes
a week but if it was on a further Wii U
I think I'd be more apt to buy it rich
are you happy no because I'm poor
oh there's the thing
probably can't take them out but we're
gonna try it yeah it's fun oh not in
that car with with three wheels do I
only have three wheels that's why I'm
sliding all over the place
technically you have three wheels and a
rim oh okay well that's good enough you
know you shoot out the flare and get
hunchback to drive your car over oh yeah
get out of this hunk of junk being rich
doesn't make you happy but being rich
Evans makes you Snuggie that I'm sure
being rich doesn't make you happy but
I'm sure I think it makes you unhappy
either and being poor can certainly make
you unhappy so I think your odds are
better if you're rich of being happy
yeah I think being rich I can rid you of
a lot of tiny nuisances stress yeah am I
gonna get kicked out on the street this
month because I can't make rent rich
people never have that that discussion
in their own head
no wait so they can sniper see me what
if I jump which one of my which one of
my bills can I afford to pay this month
right there not a conversation the rich
person has unless they're just being
cheap there's a reason that they're rich
exactly
so the snipers don't like automatically
see you but it just means like from from
there they can see me
no mr. shy smile I did not hear about or
know about the the Eurogamer article
about the cancelled thief reboot curious
to hear about it it's a series that
probably should never have been rebooted
just let it lie let it lie it's all we
got last time
we need gas
and there's the thing
I thought of this thing this looks like
a nice thing yeah Chad if you're if your
biggest worry in life is how you can
afford your next payment you don't have
problems you can also take on taking
down the snipers usually faster what
three games are you guys excited for
XCOM - Jenna I know got delayed mmm
that's why I don't get myself hyped up
for shit because this is gonna be 17
delays and who knows maybe a
cancellation or two a game and then get
on the trolley
I like that maybe a cancellation or two
what else is coming object this is
coming on I was curious I don't know if
I'd say excited I was curious about this
and it is slightly better than my
expectations so I'm happy with it now
is it bothersome that I just don't even
know what's coming out well I mean the
big things just did right so we're kind
of we're kind of past that hump is the
thing I'm upset that Metal Gear Solid 5
came out because now all everyone is
gonna be talking about it Metal Gear
Solid 5 and
just don't care about that up here I I'm
curious about the gameplay yeah I mean I
like I like stealth I just I hate metal
gears fucking story usually this might
be a rare thing where rich Evans is
skipping all the cutscenes when he can
or at least bitching about them well
we'll see cuz I like I like stealth I
like tactics when you when you look at
the gameplay the Metal Gear Solid series
is all shit I should love but then then
you just wrap it up and utter nonsense
and I just want to throw up
it's it feels to me it's like wasted
opportunity as a Metal Gear that's what
I think of yeah but if we're just
talking about shit I'm actually excited
about or at least interested in the new
doom I'm at least curious about it
I mean visually I had some critiques
that doesn't mean I'm completely writing
off the game was awful
what about Barclay game what's the
what's the new Barclay
what's the Barclay game shut up and jam
Gaiden shut up and jam Gaiden - that
looks pretty awesome I know nothing then
the first one was weird
the first one's weird and then they
kick-started the second one and they
were playing it at PAX and didn't they
have to change the name because they
didn't want to deal as I just shut up in
Jam gaiden they take that Barkley out of
it because there were there were issues
with with Charles Barkley oh I mean I'm
sure I'm very sure looks exciting in any
case looks very funny
unique I mean fallout Olympic I never
played any of the other ones really so
it's hard to be excited about that yeah
I think fallout is a game that you would
love maybe I was shocked that you never
played any of the other ones I avoided
role-playing games for many years
because I absolutely hate turn-based
JRPG combat that much it soured
it's our doll RPGs for me for like 25
years
really yeah thinking thinking like like
shit like Dragon's quest was so fucking
miserable
utterly fucking miserable random tedious
interruptions to a subpar story oh yeah
look at this little guy there's one one
time I gave Jericho Jude's chance
yeah after like later in my fight some
old SNES game I forgot I forgot what it
was even called but the story of this
guy and his childhood friend girl were
going on this grand adventure and they
know that really need characterization
going on between each other and then
there was like a chapter break and
you're your character married like the
vapid blonde bimbo between chapters and
I'll fuck this
this is not the right place anyway how
about faction am I
oh you having trouble getting in the
gates yeah okay that's a strong gate you
need to blow it up with a gas can
oh no well I think I'm trying to figure
out what what like bad guy group I
belong to so I can try to sneak into a
place you know saying okay um I don't I
find out like what car this one belongs
to if I get out Oh tell me if I look at
it no oh there go it's a car with the
thing so not this one
so that has the guy with the flames on
his head this has a car and across a
moment okay okay
they're trying to figure out the game
rules alpha I am NOT playing this on a
console because I am NOT a console
peasant this is being played on my my
high-end gaming machine which is my via
Steam smooth as butter graphics we
what's that that looks like a fun place
to go let's go over there
you have fun jack
I am in who have fun that's all that
matters oh those water people you want
it you want it friendly NPCs there you
go
should I punch him in the face you get
tribe I never tried
I'll give him water and then punch him
in the face you're out of bullets I'd
say shotgun them tight and give us some
water run them over with your car unless
they give me something if they don't
give me something useful where oh you
know what they do they put markers on
your map how do you know this that
that's the only thing that makes sense
she said you might find something useful
there oh okay I bet I'll bet that's the
reward all right
yeah hey baby okay I bet I bet that's
what it so you gave me something so I
won't kill you okay just be careful not
to accidentally run them over on your
way out of there and you're the roadkill
faction this is as undetected my rule
Jack oh no I'm so sorry
I'm sorry I distracted you if I've
mentioning my faction your car was I
just killed one of them I think I think
you should head back over there and
apologize I really I was kind of rude
okay that's yeah you're hey guys
guys seriously super sorry where are you
guys oh that's creepy
they're like ghosts I've seen them
hanging around forever too so that's
just weird like those that's right maybe
you drove at the wrong spot
or maybe there goes that one weird white
icon with the two black dots yeah you
can get maximum upgrades get out of
there I think I can get up these rocks
yeah
it is it is what's going on here with
all the creepy little drawings joke
that kind I love the creepy little drugs
hey donut says you're doing them a favor
one less person to feed and they can
feed off his corpse oh there you go
I helped drive a car across the plains
of silence in the car people trusted so
fucking mad max why was reading the chat
where you say do you trust a car more
than any man okay so what do we want to
do here right uh whatever I'll give a
fight you say that and then I'm gonna
choose the wrong thing I'll probably
start from scratch next time I play this
anyway because I'm gonna get distracted
by metal gear oh yeah yeah okay let's
see here more scrap when looting very
helpful max ability required more water
from water sources usually token to
increase Max's legend level you increase
that just by playing anyway it seems
useless to me to upgrade that but what's
legend level Frankie you're breaking up
oh well ranking up does add more slots
around that circle to upgrade but she
need like you need like ten rank ups
before you get another slot so more
damage when using a melee weapon yeah
you know yeah fuck it he's he's
upgrading the dumbest thing you can
upgrade him just I promote I'm pointing
that out I'm upgrading resistant that's
these basically that's like super
resistant yeah but also like look I have
so many points I have 11 points I know I
know
just fuckin upgrade everything I'm just
being an asshole
it's gonna be honest yeah just one of
everything yeah oh this one this one
great this one this one look like I have
so many points this is actually almost a
little ridiculous how many the gasping
there is car gas in this game you car
can't run a gas I know I've noticed all
right there we go there you go they
didn't seem to give you a fairly
generous amount but just the fact that
you can is neat yeah so I just went on a
Vision Quest something like that
you saw a weird circle thing I saw a
series of circles I like that that's the
the the upgrade menu is just a
hallucination Sara I never actually done
that what where the upgrade thing was a
hallucination does that ever happen like
a Vision Quest I'm sure I'm sure
but none that come to mind but also I'm
bad at thinking about things you know
who's good at thinking about things the
chat yeah it's pretty good at thinking
about things
that's how you
Soho wires a roadkill faction where am I
like over here there's water
blue
Rach what where am I oh I'm this blue
down you're that arrow near the top oh
shit
okay where is a roadkill faction does it
see that the thing looks like an oil rig
tower tree you're right right right up
just say who oil pump camp okay I think
those are all scrotus okay I want to
find how do we know like whose faction
is do I played this game for rich why
don't you know if I don't know 10 hours
most of it just fucking around though so
I don't know Thanks why don't you know
things okay fucking around
let's go to those things and see if we
can get to that bridge in the distance
I'll solo this whole area is basically
just sent right out
ocean or sea or something yeah all these
boats bridges
I'm not doing very well so I have any Oh
I seem to have gotten thing okay great
all right let's go to that bridge let's
