I know cam tonight because I'm in a dark
room and you wouldn't be able to see me
anyway it'll be a rough trip it used to
be it go straight up Clarence Boulevard
but now it's not so easy half the city's
dead of the plague the other half
fighting over what's left
city watch still holds the bigger
streets and they set up those wall or
like checkpoints man walks through one
of those and ends up burned to a crisp
everything not controlled by the city
watch is gang territory
the real live birds living on the
fringes like that grin rags he say she's
nuts
which is worse just take your pick
if you decide to go up clapeyron know
what the guard spot you
Hey what is it I think that last one was
moving what yeah the little one not
possibly my inspector than myself or
others moving no more
one two three he coming
so this is like beef very much so yeah
and there's some big differences but one
that I get no
half the block dead from the plague
better them than us at least some of
them had money
disgusting I'm not gonna steal from her
I'm just not gonna do it what does what
does the heart tell me are you a good
person to comment woman she's alright
she's alright or delivered for immediate
deportation to the flooded district
remain in position until qualified
personnel have completed the removal of
infected bodies
I think
granny granny granny come out with me
instead granny granny granny you can't
because your dad dear is that you my
dear husband my eyes aren't what they
used to be
have you seen my little birdies ah the
dear things must be starving without
their granny here birdies here oh my my
my heartless game people should have
random clowns people in cars yeah I've
noticed that nice ones but oh well and
they're not very polite ones either
granny rags granny rags let us in oh
well they'll go away again if they know
what's good for them but what a bother
use the key to the front door love
you'll see to those ruffians won't you
yes I would
let us thank granny I bet you can't even
hear us
have it your way we're here to take your
money granny
wasting our time how much could she have
she digs in trash for a living let's get
it drink I'm trying to know we're
seniors with prank done
should I put them somewhere safe so the
rats can't get them I mean should I
bother I might maybe I'll bother
attention dunwall citizens the following
businesses have been closed and
impounded by the state due to
contamination Pharaohs barbershop and
surgery the do condenser alehouse merits
printing firm pennyworth stack and
saddle Emporium and the smoke street
dice well fuck to kill or not to kill I
can use the combat dart but fuck it
you
attention Watchmen this district is now
considered a highly infected area
residents are to be escorted to adjacent
neighborhoods or delivered for immediate
deportation to the flooded business
shame this game offers many many options
you may have a combat that's better
because the death that's that's kind of
your penalty for failing the stealth
lasted 15 minutes a randomly random guy
m'q random happened to stumble upon the
corpse raising the keyboard and mouse or
her controlling what what would you
think I'm music knowing me knowing me
what would you assume
I think the little birdies are sad today
oh my dear I knew you'd help me with
those ill-mannered boys my brave man
listen granny has a birthday present for
you I got it from the outsider and now
I'm giving it to you go on
it's upstairs on Dom Banerjee I think
you'll cut a nice figure with it
remember how we used to dance our
parties were even grander than those at
the boil Manor everyone wanted to come
the problem is there's so many cool
things to do but they're all lethal see
that's I don't that's the brilliance of
the moral dilemma of Dishonored I might
I might say that you're better
dishonored to worry you can take on
people people easily none not legally in
combat
I can't bear these bottles street
children ruffians every last one of them
rotten apples is the worst you know what
I just thought of you could do something
else for me another little favor and I'd
give you another present another lovely
rune carved from the bones of a dead
whale do you remember any dear she's dr.
Harmon now there was a clever man he's
got all sorts of nasty rat guts and
disease in his laboratory wouldn't it be
a shame if some of that mess found its
way into the bottle street gangs elixir
still that'd teach them see to it dear
I'll find you another present just like
the first
Galvani lives on Clavin Boulevard or at
least he used to use the hurt yeah oh
yeah why not now run off my baby birdies
are hungry so precious hmm
you'll have to go or they throw garbage
I think the little birdies are sad today
careful
granny granny granny come out
be careful Gordo they call her granny
rags you wouldn't recognize her real
name or even the name of her family but
an emperor begged for her hand once and
rich young men fought each other for her
favor
I watched her consider them all measure
their Worth and find them wanting then
she made a different choice you're on
your way to face the high overseer the
leader of a great cult dedicated to
loathing me what will you do I wonder
all right I need to take a short break
we'll be we'll be right back
all right I'm back okay everybody I'm
back I know it was so quiet when I was
away all right all right so here's
another moral dilemma
the game has given me she's gonna give
me another one of these upgrade runes if
I go poison um still er II that makes
play cure with plague and I think I'm
gonna do it just now why not
I want that room I want that
motherfucking room
I mean some innocent people might drink
you know the be tainted batch but most
of the people who die will be gang
members I'm okay with killing gang
members
see gang member I felt nothing
I felt absolutely nothing
out
hey biggest look I'm trapped
there were safety Lansford
you know I'll be there to free in a
minute put this this unconscious guy
somewhere where racks cats can't eat
them you know I'm gonna throw them on
top of these plague infected corpses
that's fine that's a safe place right on
top of plague infected corpses can you
throw bodies in this yes I owe you
brother I want to ask about the mask I
wouldn't want my face seen either
pulling a stunt like that you know what
I'll return the favor come by Grif shot
that's my business
well it was at one time but now I'm
reduced to scavenging things from here
and there as the city dies if you need
anything I wouldn't mind treatment for
lo chaos ghosts will blow over I'm going
for lo chaos though I don't mind a few
bodies Miscavige it's not gonna ruin my
lo que us a few bodies want to look at
some of the things I found good prices I
swear
all right Greg Greg whatever you can go
now we're done with you I get you a good
one
all right so we've got to find infected
rat guts poison a distillery with and
there's a doctor's office over here and
that's that's probably where we're gonna
find rat guts
and I've played too but here's the thing
when I played too we're doing a review
so I didn't I didn't really have the
time to take my time but Dishonored 2
hey you know I got a gonna play a I
gotta get further I got to do this can't
can't sit around and now oh you know
playing 1 I'm enjoying it more than 2
but that's because I got I got a lot
more breathing room here there's no
deadline
it's just I'm completely free to play
this at my leisure and I like designer
to
wait Did you touch the door handle - dr.
gull Bonnie's lab yeah I think so
then you have to scrub the rats get
their vital essences every where the
doctor said vital essences sent me me
guts I think so so your hands need
scrubbing you're unclean unclean that's
nonsense
can't we just no I told you with rubbing
alcohol or white vinegar all right all
right
what is he doing there all day Ambrose
says it breeds rats that carry the
plague
your friends are ignorant the doctor is
a brilliant man if anyone can save this
city it's him the Royal physician is
going to save us
is this ulcer disease destroyers gonna
be so understand how probably what do
you play this Jack it's gonna be around
Royal physician or not I hear tell has
nothing against Jack it's just the same
game dishes philanderer who spends more
time with prostitutes and he does in the
laboratory is this what it's going to be
like when we're married it is isn't it I
hope not
I'm telling you now I don't have the
endurance for it
no facecam tonight because I'm in a dark
room a game like Dishonored really
really needs to be played in a dark room
skipping all that lore
all that long crying out
mission clues when I get
obviously the playground is distinct
from the ordinary rat but in what
respect its size and the coarseness of
its ferb and I believe in intelligence
although the experiments they are not
complete
coriander's zoological Survey describes
only the ordinary rat plague rats okay
the jerk steals from at five or seven
years of most this was not a gradual
migration but they have been introduced
on purpose
sometimes this game can make you feel
really scuzzy really really scuzzy
and yet I don't have to do any of this
this is an optional side quest I am free
to not rob the the plague doctors home
but I'm doing it anyway
got my bad guts oh that's disgusting
not one I guess we're just gonna turn
the faucet on and not really wash our
hands after grabbing the rat guts yes he
just yes what are you doing up here
I don't think she alerted anyone else I
think we got lucky I think we got really
lucky there but this is I'm wearing a
mask
it'll be fine
I think I think we got really lucky with
her not alerting those guards downstairs
I remember what it was but we didn't we
didn't find the clue for the combination
of the safe in here which is nice
fuck fuck that plague doctor fuck em
alright this could be going smoother
what we're doing all right what did I
miss a painting hold on which one this
no I'm unable to grab this one
I'm going to presume we're good with
paintings did I go downstairs hi no
there's guards down there and I I don't
need anything down there
it's not worth alerting them any terms
in there let me see oh go back one more
time we'll check for bone charms
we're we're looking good
no bones germs
I'm not checking for roads I just did
can we get a no kill no detection run on
this game um that could be tedious
potentially
I mean you try for it when you play but
if I fill I'm not gonna you know reload
an old save just to just to do that I'm
going to accept the the occasional
bloodied hands is just that's that's the
price of failure man that bars the price
of failure
slightly awkward position this game
ain't worth it your opinion yeah try it
up try it out you might have to
experience and plus there's there's
nothing forcing you to play this game
non-lethal even like you can just
fucking kill everything if you really
wanted to
boss likes laptop this is one hot bird
can sorts with crazies does rituals and
the like bone charms and such
you sound afraid damn right I am
doubting an ordinary man touched by the
outsider he is giving dark powers he can
sleep here throw it across the room well
bad give him a leg up for sure
it's no coincidence per his name is it
true that he lives in the flooded
district with them weepers and wild
hounds that's what they say perfect
place for a paid killer died thousands a
fucking bad-ass thousand does the jerk
that killed your lover and kidnapped
your kid all right
doubt can suck a fat bag of dicks I know
people like doubt but fuck him I am so
murdering his ass
there's a lot of people in my to kill
list I'm on the fence about whether or
not I'm gonna let him go but I am
sledding downs fucking throat
doesn't doubt canonically survive I
don't give a shit about cannon this is
my playthrough of the game and quite
frankly a detail like that
I really think arcane should have gone
out of their way not to not to make that
a cannon thing they should have avoided
mentioning doubt
don't be south not till the next batch
of elixirs death
so he goes not to the abbey for the
office of high overseer where they train
the overseers to be religious he just
wants to know where his brothers gone
sneaks it you know Eddie Boyet at it
when it's solar brimsley job hidden the
dumbwaiter off into the crowd
ghosts like the ghosts
not quite what I wanted to do but I'll
take it
do it we did it can't stop me now and we
did it when infected the the cure with
plague here's a list of the families
that I'm finding that their watertown
plague here by the way so so we're a
jerk
if I leave the body here doesn't that
make it a little bit obvious that
something shady happened
get out there
look it's not even stash this body I
don't know if there is what I totally
blinked over that you're nuts game
you're nuts
I didn't steal some first I got I got
help elixirs coming out of my ass I
don't need them
this look actually teleporter is just
faster I've gotten past that trap when I
wasn't carrying a body
well I know a hundred of these old rags
my mama used to tell
fuck out
I got it here
appreciate I think it's the water do one
room behind where
I think you're wrong
nothing's peirong
where I went should be in range if
anything I would have missed
granny rags it's got a room need to
forget bad and the one through all
that's distillery nonsense for nothing
get out I knew you wouldn't disappoint
me now I can stroll along the waterfront
and peace and don't think I've forgotten
your little gift go on upstairs dear one
I told him peel it off peel it off so I
can breathe that will never wash never
never never
happy I killed all those people I'm
gonna make the false assumption that the
gang die is from the tainted plague
before they could sell any I'm gonna
make that false assumption that I'm
almost certain the game disproves oh the
room yeah I'm an idiot thank you thank
you
all right powers I mean the first
thing's gotta be blinking to the Hastur
blink is too useful
I just need that bone term that makes
the magic recharge that's what I needs
doing great I couldn't be doing better
oh he was dead anyway Oh Griff can I
afford your other thing go to shop
whatever get all the things right we
want all the things
nope nope nope I am that was an accident
fuck all right I'm not happy about that
fuck
yeah that could have been worse it was
you know what it was
here's the real penalty in a stealth
game that made me feel very an elegant
failing the stealth is its own
punishment in a well-made stealth game
no there's anywhere safe to put him but
we're just gonna we're gonna throw him
there he's going right there
cold is a whalers gaff in 50 years old
at least this guy fuckers forget his old
ass you'd even remember the inference we
tagged it plain under clattering Street
is ours
come on what's the take
like 25
god damn it god damn it in elegant in
elegant very elegant all right come on
what's the take warning + 2 elixir
that's not a safes come that was a
legitimate failure
I just get along he starts to come all
the way off is that true or is it the
itching that really gets you or the rats
Jasper isn't it it's not so bad in here
except I miss your wife huh
you don't scare easy I'll give you that
but that'll change what a sight you are
in that mask I know who you are and what
you're here to do and I can help unlock
me and I'll buy you a drink sure maybe
if you run through it and you're a
little bit so happy I'll buy you a
hundred drinks I don't know or if you
really know where to go but I don't
feels good to stand up straight thank
you Corvo what you're here to do tonight
is of the highest importance we've got
to find Emily so kill Campbell and make
it quick
once it's done search his body for the
journal his notorious black book and get
out of there
Campbell is meeting with the gardening
colonel and word from my informant is
that Campbell is going to poison him
maybe you can use that to your advantage
all right I won't be of any help here so
I'll make my own way back to the Hound
pits pub if I see Samuel the boatman
I'll tell him to pick you up in the
backyard behind the office of the high
overseer may all the spirits guide you
the mayor enemies head hit the floor
without you taking a scratch
I was just reading in the archive about
the heretics right so high overseer
Campbell lethal and non-lethal
assassination used what do we want what
does everybody want occurrence but I did
spy the face of one so branded a former
member of our order of course out on a
retreat we passed through a fishing town
and saw him making his crime who can say
the brand is reserved for an overseer or
even the high overseer himself who
violates non-lethal it's crueler I kind
of agree with that me remember the
sentence strictures and you never need
worry about such matters yes the
possible solutions for this part are
fucking great and amazing
wasn't he the one that girl wanted saved
the guy he's meeting with is but there's
a guy we're here to kill that's a
different guy
I think the non-lethal czar more
engaging I haven't I haven't beaten the
game yet so I can't say for everybody I
know I know the twins one is pretty
underwhelming you hear about it after
the fact
and it's like
oh I'm not I don't want to I am I am NOT
I'm not in stealth mode I'm just walking
I don't think I know enough of the
overseers Laura to be able to call the
assholes is that the regular dart not
the sleep Dart okay that's one more kill
hey coins at xuer coins always pick up
those Sewer coins
all right these overseers I know I know
there's some kind of religious sect I I
really wonder if this didn't start as
some kind of thief game because because
thieves got the hammerites and and
dishonored it's got the the overseers I
know I know I know some of the same
people who made theif worked on this but
saying I wonder man
I only got a couple of tips here uh
Hagrid blaggard says hi space cadets
which bit of pointless modern pop
culture are you most looking forward to
and ready player one I don't know I
don't know what all is in ready or one
I'm gonna say none of them um Boudreaux
says hey rich
Star Wars question mellitus XCOM aww
campaign I've missed almost all my shots
above 85% that's almost certainly not
true that'd be highly statistically
unlikely and several about 95 bad rng
yeah I know statistics can be weird but
if you experienced this look here's the
thing you you notice the ones that you
think you should make more than you
notice it when you actually make them
15% to missed is still a percent right
let you test the tips I got it was word
of Badman about
here's a good boy good boy justice
settle down man it's only me
Boreas gone to the flooded district and
all the rest of them so it's just me
tonight one don't
a little bit lucky don't you call that a
little bit lucky
but first yeah I mean it's not and this
is my second time through this mission
if I've been playing this on my own but
I haven't finished the game yet so read
that as you will
by the way the secret room way too
obvious and easy to find
guess those fools and Coleridge for
letting Corvo get away who knows what
the man could do now Hiram o
Regent as he asked just to call him now
seems to have faith in all the Sokolov
security devices he's put up all over
the city but I'm not so sure at least
the girl has been moved to a safe place
visiting her twice a week is giving me
ample opportunity we saw paintings of
dependability yeah that's the mask a lot
of downs men interesting interesting
and no wine bottle I have to pay
attention is there no wine bottle if
there's no wine bottle in that painting
can I see it after the fact well let me
see it after the fact if if that
painting had no wine bottle because I
took the wine bottle earlier in the game
I love this game so much more that is
there's an amazing attention to teat
that's the case notes books audio drafts
books written notes no no if you steal
the bottle it's not in the painting oh
that's awesome I love this game so much
I love this game so much
oh that got out of there just in time
tonight
did you get caught at the lockdown last
night six hours search the place top to
bottom and nothing to eat with the swill
we hand out free of course we didn't
find anything did I ever tell you one
time one of the second-floor shutters
got stuck open and I thought I could
slip out I couldn't find a way down by
the time I got back I spent the rest of
lockdown out on a Ledge
maybe the outsider was watching
to the beginning it was Martin's plot to
break him out of cold rich prison that's
clear enough but why Corvo the one man
feared throughout the empire
he's as skilled as they say he got
through he would have for watching he
had help yes how far does it go the
trail goes too much too far
fuck it there's the branding iron
we need all right here's the non-lethal
way to take out overseer Campbell is
these religious heretics they have a
brand that they put on heretics to get
them kicked out of the order and so
we're we're gonna force them out of
office by ostracizing them
kill half his guards but not him that's
the kind of guy I am a fuckup
I'm a stealth fuckup
all right here's what's happened the guy
I got a murder is having a meeting with
the guy I optionally
optionally have to save and the guy I
need to assassinate it's going to poison
the guy I have to say see this see this
is a table here and there's two glasses
right I I have a choice on what I do
here were children playing game I can
switch the poison I can combine them
poison them both which is kind of great
honestly or I can destroy both glasses
it's in since I'm trying to do the
non-lethal kill I don't want either of
them to die so I'm going to just spill
both glasses but they give you the
option to poison the first thing that I
loved about this bit is they give you
the option to poison both that does you
no good but they put it in there anyway
because this game is awesome and this
game wants to give you options so we're
gonna spill the drinks
many rooms do I have to do what I need
oh I have four I can afford this the
sleep carts ready watch videos of good
people playing this game it's kind of
amazing what you can do
the servants must have been in here let
me see it seems I have the wrong one not
that one yeah now if you'll join me men
will come get you when we're finished I
don't understand how this got so
unpleasant well I agree or dies and
suddenly this what do you have wine
it's a kivi enriched thank you
it's pissed off that is wine what is
still Dover I owe you an apology
captain this is hardly the hospitality I
planned for you well time to do this
these are gonna kill him anyway so we
have to stop time and do some stuff
Wow Pororo you can you can take some
sleep darts pick them up I know I'm
gonna be making my escape through here
so I'm gonna set down corn row there
where I know it's safe and then I gotta
get Campbell out of here before guards
come in this room
I think rapping nobody's there I just
want to see what they do
so they do realize something's up when
they don't see anyone all right all
right I wasn't sure how they'd react
so uh this is the non-lethal option
this is a full non-lethal right no no
I'll find you I would have been proud if
I got goes but I fucked up too hard for
that
we're just enjoying this a little too
much this game is fucking awesome
first time I played through this right
I not cornrow out
I take Campbell I I do the branding and
then I go to leave and I realized this
is shit tunnel level after you fucking
do your main objective there's a shit
ton of stuff after this right and then I
finished the level and then I found out
cornrows still dead and I'm thinking
wait a minute
I knocked cornrow out but the game
condom is dead because I didn't take his
body with me and it was like they they
thought of that detail like if you don't
take his body with you then the bad
guy's henchmen are probably just going
to kill them anyway I'm like that's a
really neat touch that's a really neat
touch
person in champ I don't know that I'm
liking this more than dishonored to as
much as it is I I have I'm not under any
kind of deadline I have the time to just
take and just enjoy this game and I I
didn't with dishonored to
by playing the whole game I don't know
maybe maybe I'm not playing it all
tonight No
all right so I put cornrows safely in a
dumpster now we can we can go about the
game
should be gathered for whiskey and
cigars tonight never doubt of the way
you expect preferential treatment just
because you are her brother she will all
which is must burn
you appeared as if from nowhere we would
both be dead if not for you we are
forever in your debt
I cannot thank you enough I must get my
sister to safety but first I may know of
a way to thank you there's a safe in the
bunkhouse
the combination is 2:03 take what you
want and good luck rich have you seen
those high-skill chaos playthroughs of
this game I've seen a couple of them and
if you if you mildly enjoy watching me
play this tonight go on YouTube and
fucking look this up there are there are
some people who know this game amazingly
well and they basically just show off
and they do some amazing fucking shit
while they play this game
the same way I played Dead Rising 1 I
just played Dead Rising 1 very very well
these the runs they're talking about are
people playing this game they're just
showing off they're doing unnecessary
shit and they're just showing off and
it's really kind of amazing to just
watch
like this there's more there's more
stuff I can do we finished the main
objective the level is not over I think
I think I'm just gonna get to the boat
quickly but so much shit to do
is that zombie
that's got some fucking eagle-eyed
vision
thank you
so I'm not going for the sake now no no
I think we've we've spent enough time
here I'm debating in my head whether or
not I'm going to play much more of this
tonight or if I'm going to get in a
little bit of into the breach
a Corvo it's Samuel I'm here from the
way I hear it
Campbell lived a pretty posh life maybe
it's not my place to say but men of the
faith shouldn't live like barons are you
ready to go
okay let's go
all right I found the only sokoloff
painting oh yeah I forgot it it's not a
couple of obvious runes that's fine it's
fine
Admiral Havelock and Wilson first live
stream I've actually enjoyed it want to
congratulate why do you much much
I'm glad you're enjoying
people want to join this that's good
he's alive
Thank You Corvo thank you my uncle is a
good man and one day he'll prove it
here I know you did this for the right
reasons but I want you to take this as a
reward
it's an old heirloom one of my aunt's
gave me a hundred bucks on thanks this
is going to work we have to take down
the Lord Regent and all his key allies
you know that yes hopefully the high
overseer is the first step you did it
somehow you took down the high overseer
Campbell against the odds I knew you
were our man called the Campbell gone
we've heard the Lord Regent and
measurements and with Martin back we'll
have the finest strategist alive the
Lord Regent must be shitting himself in
dumb wall tower yes and Campbell's
journalist not forget our hope is that
in these encoded pages the location and
condition of emily kaldwin can be
discovered our entire movement will mean
nothing if we can't place them no you
did this here right reasons said to
poison her for hire oh you're not for
life we must this is no doubt the Lord
this is personal thing Emily somewhere
waiting to reveal her step out as the
hero and further cement his Regency if
he doesn't bring the young lady forth
soon your motivations are either revenge
or wanting to save your daughter but
you're not doing this for money let's go
yes time or even asset you weren't even
an assassin before this you were the
opposite of an assassin or a bodyguard
journal then share the fucking awful one
Oh meeting game-saving your daughter
yeah
all right I'll play all right people
want to see more of this I'll play more
of this but I need to take a break I
need to just get a snack and brain chill
for a bit so I return but we're taking a
break
you
alright alright um I'm back back ish
there's game
