to the chat they're talking about
something oh they're talking about
something I don't know what the document
doesn't matter
400 enemies yep what's the hardest
difficulty where's the center of this
map

careful going up north I dropped that
Tesla tower and that will fuck your shit
up
Zed go south go south you're gonna get
fucked up all right I got a turret down
houses all just this little area here
apparently
protected
all right we're all alive
that's positive
though I should have taken a different
cook yeah yeah we'll be fine oh you can
you can revive in the MEC but kill the
guys first
unless
right check back ok then I could call it
the fallout from that dropping from the
sky
yep Oh God
all right take the side to turn somebody
and protect the tank
I chose the wrong side
all right now on the right side
think it's all crazy
fuck fuck fuck fuck thank you the heel
I'm trying to serve tank mo for the big
bugs you know sure
Shepard them
speaking of getting the turret get the
Turk didn't it weird I draw there him

of them spot huh
somebody defendant defend the yep you

strats oh my god someone just dropped me
on a bug nice
yeah here
teamwork teamwork it's working
how many tell how many rounds this thing

almost we're almost two-thirds of the
way through 3/4 3/4 the way that's even
better

can't believe that all right use that
real strike or something
Oh Oh
it's too hard it's too hard rich knows
the way there you're given up too easy
but you know what the problem is rich
what I just noticed something our stream
tip alerter
yeah look at the the scroll bar on the
right oh our stream tip alerter is not
all the way up oh so what happened was
our stream tip alerta thing yeah that
was our fault so it was of course it was
course avid roses fuck the haters play
more undertale thank you have a drill
and then anonymous well no oh and we
don't read anything under to Dallas but
you know that was our fault and I'm
sorry about that
yeah we figured it out eventually and I
think that's the important part
let's do it again I don't forgetting
that much out of the tourists so I'm
gonna ditch the one tour it I'm gonna
take another mech okay that's my my
strategy okay Gemma Gemma G extremities
you must remove which tram that's mr.
Val mr. Val yeah that's pretty good
mr. Bob let's see here I am gonna just
grab another one of these big guns I
think that was really helpful I think
this takes strategy wasn't working that
bad no thanks resi was great we like to
thank strategy I was great I want to
hear a guy getting yelled at by his
girlfriend mama agreed Joe kitty I
didn't change my person that's fine
Deneb second Asst Deneb secundus Deneb
that's the name of this planet rich
tenodesis no worse thing where was it
mentioned something he was that the the
old rebel base that Leia gave I don't
Tarkin that wasn't really was that it
was that de NAB I what I had no that was
then doing okay yeah what was done am I
have no idea what's it done AB Chad I'm
dropping a electric turret so stay away
from that one
Wow it's right away it's right away rich
and I think Jack just tried to save us
save us now shit Oh get up get up get up
get up get up I got you thank you that
was
un-fuckin'-believable whoever yeah
fuck
fuck not going well not going well thank
you thank you
I gotcha I gotcha huh I got you I know
and I just like I just respond
all right dragon what do you have for
weaponry you might not have the proper
caliber are you using a pistol no no no
no just that shotgun well no ok I'll
drop it I'll drop a good gun you said
that's that's the problem huh that's the
pro the problem is I keep running into
fire my shotguns great time for the time
of the tank
starting to get the big bugs
whoa
Oh
fucking shots does this thing take
oh shit
all right somebody shoot those fuckers
down there or kicked me down thank you
Jesus
request confirm
alright so the kind of things can
install let's get out of tape
Wow that's everything yep Wow Wow we did
significantly worse that time hey guys
Bella hecka hey guys it's 11:46 eastern
time I'm sending you this tip right now
so that you read it 10 minutes later to
remind me to take out the garbage before
I go to bed well bill we're reading
things on time now but you should still
should take out the garbage before you
go to bed that's very important
all right strategy changes okay I'm now
not liking the tank as much as I was
it's hard to defend it's hard to defend
and you know with the two side guns
so I think I'm just gonna take a couple
of mechs and stuff okay that's probably
good idea yeah that you know what
leftover beefcake that was all me like I
died so many times I was just getting
caught in everybody's crossfire so my
and I know I should buy eggs all right I
know actually today I don't need to buy
eggs I just bought eggs this morning
felt pretty good about that good about
my egg buying responsibilities you know
I wonder if an electric deterrent if you
can put two together will they destroy
each other I guess we'll find out I
wonder if they'll to double the damage
or if we're just see you know right now
I'm not gonna
it'll probably fail I'm just gonna take
another backer yeah
I got a personal defense er to the back
now another back all right all right I
forgot to change my forget
okay
let's do this
if you are literally on fire going prone
will put out the fire or to upgrade your
weapons and stratagems in the armory all
right
don't move
I didn't know it's hot the controller
read I did not touch the fucking
controller mother fucker
thank you
I gotta hear
all right everything's fine annex fine
it's fun
I'm gonna wait till the big bug start
dropping before I drop my mix starts off
a little bit easier yeah
actually jack but you can use my back
you know cuz I think you're having
trouble with firepower am i right
no no I'm just dying because you're
having trouble with a firepower
no no why are you kidding I'm what are
you shooting them a machine gun the
regular one yeah you don't have the
firepower you can use my mech these guys
have a lot of heavy armor huh so you
need the armor-piercing rounds
which you don't have no no I know you
don't I know you know just you haven't
played the game that much and yeah which
is why I won the mech comes down which
I'm gonna do right now yeah you grab the
Mac that'll give you the firepower you
need okay I have I have a pretty good
assault rifle that has armor piercing
capability okay I can take these guys
down quicker with the machine gun than
you can
you
what you got the artillery there goes
the man see this is might like my
problem is I'm just for some reason I am
caught in everyone's crossfire well
don't don't wander ever towards the
middle like okay never we're gonna live
on the edges live on the edge Jack live
on the edge livin on the edge

fucking turret for this one all right
all right done got laid
hey done I always say his name wrong
d'hubert Gately I like it that you say
wrong it's gonna be great I was um I can
talk a little bit about blood-borne I
know rich got pretty far in the DLC I
finally leveled up enough I feel
comfortable enough to really get into
the new area into the hunters nightmare
and I've been really loving it and I got
to the first kind of boss guide like
that big horse monster whoever that is
it's awesome I'm nowhere close to
beating the horse monster yet but like I
have all the other areas figured out I
got a bunch of the new weapons already
the the whirligig saw that is a fun one
but I'm still using Simon's Bowl I'm
ready I'm using Simon's bow most of the
time because like I just spent some time
went through the other game and put put
points into skill and blood-tinged
info Simon's bow is super super
it's great it's great this is a Noah's
Mike you shouldn't might be as far just
to play blood-borne I agree but it's
like you know if you're going if you're
on the fence if you're on the fence
blood-borne would push you over kind of
game it would and well you know like for
example like Helldivers there's a lot of
games that are also on PC that are now
on ps4 and this was on ps4 this is on
ps4 first like a you know like almost
you're eight months ten months exactly
and so like it's one of those things
it's one of those great things where if
you were on the fence the Supreme
Chancellor wish to board immediately
what who oh shit is this snow oh fuck
I'm gonna need boots I'm not equipped I
am not equipped properly this is gonna
been bad
I love how great the big dumb weapons
are in blood-borne like I I was using
that fire hammer for the longest time
and it's the biggest dumbest weapon just
you know but it blows everything up its
grave
it's great
all right normal fire probably isn't
gonna work
we're gonna need we're gonna need need
to hit this fucker with like rocket
launchers and shit God look at that guy
he looks great
mr. bib says just wanted to say that
after trying some streaming for the past
few days I have a better understanding
of the troubles you guys have had in the
past
Thank You mr. Pibbs it's you know
there's a lot there's a lot of points of
failure oh my god
so we're seven shades of fucks the
problem with snow is that you move
slower you walk a lot slower we need to
run to beat the sky and we can't run or
we need leveled anti-tank mines which I
don't have
oh oh you're happy just to change into
the snow bubai okay why isn't this the
old oh jeez I know because I rich rich
played that on Wednesday right you were
oh yeah solo stream with that yeah so
rich did a lot of that on Wednesday and
I have been playing blood poor and at
home which is like here I want to take a
little break I want to take a little
break I love blood-borne Game of the
Year I have enough don't have enough
science to get anti-tank mines no the
one thing I would want for blood-borne I
need I need the power enough to hear I'd
three research points I have one the one
thing I would want for blood-borne is a
PC port so more people can play it I
want more people to love blood-borne
octo J is stuck in a bit make him stop I
can't you got a bit what's this bit uh
if you have a bit you got to see it
through
I enjoy bits it's it look I I see hey
says a communications disruption can
only mean one thing
invasion I think he's doing lines from
the Independence Day there's a
communications disruption
oh it's a thing oh what's the thing it's
an appropriate thing he's doing an
appropriate bit then I can't there's no
way I can make him stop you you once you
start doing a bit you got to see the bit
all the way through I'm a believer in
the bit firm I don't I mean I've never
played dota 2 III I have a friend and I
might by the way am I the only one with
the all-terrain boots I would guess that
like it looks like Dark Souls anti-gay
and they are pretty new ok ok oh my god
so I've never played dota 2 I've seen
while I have a friend who is crazy super
into Wow and I've played a little bit of
it and yeah they're just not my my kind
of things dota 2 i hear is fantastic if
you can really get into it and I don't I
don't have the time
why did this have to be on fucking snow
why Oh
octo Jay is doing only he's only
speaking in quotes from episode one
that's that's his bit man just go go
ahead Mandy bit do your bit they will
hate you for it though okay
not the hero they need another hero they
deserve either of the need well I
assumed it was Independence Day because
isn't that what happens in Independence
Day is Jeff Goldblum is like all right
everybody in the top right of the map I
have dropped two single-use rocket
launchers I suggest somebody grab one
unless you already have a different
weapon all right you already drop your
weapon and I guess it's fine oh this is
gonna be a nightmare
oh but we can reload each other you
grabbed a regular rocket launcher that's
fantastic
that's fantastic Naz Gore the destroyer
reload me reload me
nice I'll sit here how much hair do you
really have do you need to shave it all
right we got we got to go to the edge of
the map so we don't have the
communications disruption never right
I'm there you know you can kind of see
right now it's been a while since I
shaved you know I have a crown that's
what I have and so I shave it I like
right now I'm Picard because I I've been
really busy the past couple weeks and so
I just haven't had time to shave all
right well I gotta go back and grab that
rocket launcher get done man
hey we can respond him later I'm not
killing myself just to get done right
remember yeah Kevin I think you gave me
too much credit
all right grab it grab it
oh fuck we were too close
that was me I really we blew each other
up all right said you got to respond us
when he can man I gotta do it you gotta
do it
come on Zed that knows what he's doing
Zed knows what he's doing he's taking
care of the the communication block
which just there's damn smart
sure that's damn smart it's not really
communications block it's really it's
anti-aircraft guns that keep the things
you call from dropping it just means you
can't call anything down oh sure sure
nice okay here come nice said Zed's on
it
Jedi fan four-to-one hey guys always
enjoyed your streams and thought I'd
finally tip you quick question what have
been your favorite films of 2015 so far
PS rich I hate Mass Effect 3 is ending
with just as much as you do
yeah it was awful it was just fucking
sickening it was sickening horseshit I'd
have to remember what came out this year
you know there's this I mean obvious
answer is double down did you just die
horrible yeah okay the obvious answer is
double down it's the snow was just gonna
fuck us one fuck we're fine by the
nature of this area we're fucked
it's true that's true oh that's right
Mad Max Kamath is you're mad max oh yeah
Mad Max is the best film this year then
yes good yeah Mad Max and then like a
hair below it double down that Maxim
that we're just counting any film we see
any film I've seen this year
absolutely okay I finally saw Casablanca
right up there
Mad Max Double Down Casablanca
what was my favorite part of the max
landis visit is just it was a he was a
good dude that my favorite part is when
watching the Neal Breen movie was
watching double downs I want him to
along with him no he was just a cool
dude and we chatted a lot and it was he
is much like us and so we had very good
conversations along we won't have to eat
at this great sausage place they had
really great sausage I'm not sure if
that cardio's can even do any good in
the snow mm-hmm does it Z because it
keeps you from sprinting at all I
thought but I could be wrong was
important in the game all right I'm
sorry I'm interrupting your conversation
I didn't see Krampus so I can't tell you
if that was the the best movie huh I
know I didn't see Krampus and you know
what I actually don't know if I am gonna
be able to see Star Wars right when it
comes out I might have to wait a little
bit the movie theater near my house is
only showing in 3d and I just don't
emulators yay or nay yay the rich says
yay I say name because it's stealing
yeah I know I know that's what you know
that's that's fine it's fine if you say
that but it's it's still technically we
need more sausage more so yeah you're
right so I'm probably like I and you
know what like I'm in no really the only
hurry I am in to see Star Wars is to
talk about it on the stream like I I am
in no particular hurry to see Star Wars
I'm sure it's going to be perfectly
adequate as literally that's all we've
been saying from the very beginning is
Star Wars is going to be perfectly
adequate and I think it will be and I
mean just in no hurry to see it it's
gonna be fine
everything's gonna be fine
what foods are Milwaukee famous for uh
you know obviously we're cheese is a
Wisconsin thing we're a dairy state
Milwaukee is a brew city we're
not--we're most famous for our beer
because we had a lot of breweries no
what the fuck does something call in
front of me god damn it
miller brewery Pabst brewery I like
Schlitz all those old where we're brew
City and so really we're not famous for
food we're famous for for beer and now
we have just so many fuckin breweries
it's great it's absolutely good it's one
of my favorites oh this I played this
map there's random people and we had a
lot of rock look just running around the
edge reloading each other taking
potshots at him but we can't do that
because of the fucking snow this is
roaring is raining on my goddamn parade
as well this is done I'm very sorry
like we're getting chase dog down by the
dogs and we can't run from the dogs
this is horseshit this is flaming horse
shit rich did you buy any of the DLC
yeah are the boots in the DLC yep yeah
how much was it for everything wasn't
nothing another 20 no there's another 20
I think for everything
oh really yes I guess no no I don't know
it's worth it for the boots well but
yeah you said if a game is no longer
even being published why the fuck do you
care about paying for forward the people
who made it aren't profiting from your
purchase only the CD resellers
there there is a logic in that there are
some people who are emulating you know
like you can get like a DSM you later a
3ds emulator and those are still being
sold and so there is piracy and stealing
happening just one of those things where
and do you think that sometimes a a
pirated old game can act as like a
almost like a demo here's the thing sure
ages ago eight years ago I stumbled
across a ROM for harvest oh okay I've
never heard of harvest me before yeah
read the description farming simulator
like what the fuck is this never would
have bought that game in my own just
reading the back of the box but it was
sounded so strange Oh try it out loved
it I bought every version of the game
that came out for like years until I
thought the series started getting bad
sure but they had because of one rom
they got like 200 and dollars out of me
and I think that is one example on one
side and I think there's other examples
on the other side of people who only
steal games and never pay for them so
that bounce is each other out
but you know what you have nowadays is
you have all these older games that are
coming out on Virtual Console so you can
still they're still buying you know like
nes games you can buy on the Wii U and
so buying an emulator of them is not
buying them on the Wii U okay I'm sorry
yeah no um oh you did you lost someone
yeah you lost here I'm saying you could
jump
someone can jump in you can you could
jump in on my computer rather than going
through your laps are like well then you
would have you would have the boots oh
I'll just wait for someone else well I
don't think this is gonna go anywhere
with under these conditions right the
fact that even they would even let a
boss spawn in the snow territory is just
fucking evil
I want to smack the Debs for that it's
like they Dark Souls MLG says it's like
they want you to buy the DLC yeah by the
way yeah yeah point there but you get a
point
still with the DLC with all the DLC
forty bucks not bad not bad not great
and you know like wait so good buying
albums even after pirating to support
drivers and you know obviously like this
there's there's all these graders
there's all this anecdotal evidence of
you know people who pirate our you know
people say that people who pirate movies
are also the people who buy the most
movies as well there's all there's a lot
to go around for this is it's a personal
decision for me where I get a pirate
pirating can hurt people especially
smaller people I cause I already could
kill us
oh absolutely absolutely pirating an
AdBlocker
can kill us literally Starks hold
waiting so what about Little Jimmy who
emulates chromo trigger and then buys
means right exactly Dark Souls like and
like I said I think it's on both sides
personally I I go for for a hundred
percent legit too legit to quit
because I huh oh my god both of you play
a pro nice nice
laissez faire I don't you know what I
don't know what laissez faire is I am a
capitalist I enjoy capitalism that is
for sure I don't know what laissez faire
means though so I do apologize buyer
beware I believe Oh God we're dead irate
what's buyer like what does that mean I
know I'm buyer beware means but the
person selling you something is gonna
try and cheat you the person who you
might you might be buying a piece of
junk that's somebody sold something
great
oh okay no I think there needs to be
consumer protection of course are you
are you about done for the night I'm
asking me yeah yes Oh done got Lee's XIV
oh maybe has a second player there or is
that is that a glitch Scott Lee oh okay
okay are you about done yeah yeah do you
want to plug in the second controller
uh-huh and then we'll try it okay with
you having the boots we'll give it one
shot all right
laissez-faire equals a policy or
attitude of letting things take their
own course without interfering no no no
I don't believe in your pure free market
capitalism oh yeah I guess I'm oh I hope
you wear and Leslie for the things the
things people say in whatever all right
kid buttons can you all right no like
pure pure unadulterated Gary market cap
