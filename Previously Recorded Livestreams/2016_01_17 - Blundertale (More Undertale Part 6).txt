operational space station no one can do

not doing Palpatine professionally right

saying it wrong I'm the only one saying
it right now this is a a work in
progress so don't judge it too hard but
you know how Metatron always faces
forward that's because there's a switch
on his backside so so if you can turn
him around
well press the button and the switch on
who you know he'll be he'll he'll he'll
he'll be vulnerable vulnerable I've

Tarantino has a long history of making
very good movies that's all I got that's

fridge
okay I'll take them we need healing
items some right
all right let's do it
got the keys let's go let's see what
sort of emotional heart this game on
earth send us rich
when one day the human became very ill
the thick human had only one request to
see the flowers from their village but
there was nothing we could do the next
day the next day
as well wracked with grief definitely um
first round wreck with grief
well absorb the soul he transformed into
a being with a mobile phone
wait the human soul crossed through the
burial he carried the human's body into
the sunset back to the village of the
humans has crossed over and for
reserving the the soul of the Dead
kidney okay else we all reach the center
up the village there he found a bed of
golden flowers he carried the human unto
it
suddenly screams rang out the villager
saw has real hold in the human's body
they thought he had killed the child
okay
the humans had decked him with
everything they had he was struck with
blow after blow Ezreal had the power to
destroy them all boy bands we all did
that fight back
watch it as we all smiled and walked
away
okay
always stumble at all he's entered the
castle into the castle against his dust
spot across the God and he became the
flower of man I don't know
I'm plowing him but Kingdom fell into
the bear the king the Queen had lost to
the children in one night the humans
once again
yeah my good man good man
the King decided it was time to end our
suffering every human who falls down
here must die within ourselves we can
shatter the barrier for you there it's
not long now
King ESCO will give myself King a
scarlet save us all you should be
smiling duel are you excited aren't you
happy
why'd you happy that be things are going
on his joy
it's like joy sub didn't that take me
there oh it's a Save button
I want healing items god dammit I don't
think we needed healing items they can't
be right that can't be right let's say
just in case now say just in case no
there's no way out
there's no way out oh you can't go in
that elevator and I go down oh wait I
didn't use the elevator right because
I'm stupid you should have saved before
you done that just in case yeah they're
not gonna block your path it's fine
I declare it's fine it's fine
everything's fine I'm not looking at the
chat I just want to let everybody know
that put the old eleven I'm not fighting
them without an army of cheeseburgers in
my pocket sure if you can even get an
army okay you can hear them can you see
case
that was that was a nice little little
weird story bit it was a little you know
well heavy a little heavy on the start
but it was nice
oh we don't have any money for anything
oh this is terrible
well you can buy one way go back can
sell sell that knife no no you can't you
got an extra hamburger hamburger
I'm gonna star fruit thing yeah what's
that a hammer 40 now I think you know
what a hamburger is 40 now the starter
started me it's a hamburger shop I
assumed they were all hamburgers
what what's going on and then I guess
you're not reading the champ I'm not
reading the chat because I don't want I
want I want to discover who as glorious
through the game and I'm very sure
someone in the chat is saying something
at this exact moment so I'm not looking
at the chat save again so you don't have
to be bit bit bit
all right last corner wait go back to
that what say 562 minutes that can't be
right that that really can't be right
exactly what that means
that's 562 minutes I'm not sure divided
by sixty ten hours I'm not sure I'm not
sure either I think that's our play time
oh oh here we go that since his sands as
go
that's a I think that's my sensor so you
finally made and the end of your journey
is at hand in a few moments you will
meet the king together you will
determine the future of this world last
then now you will be judged you will be
judged for your every action you will be
judged for every expe over Quan cxp it's
an acronym it stands for execution
points a way of quantifying the pain you
have inflicted on others when you kill
someone you're exp increases when you
have enough he asked me your love
increases too as an acronym it stands
for level of violence oh I have
measuring someone's capacity to hurt or
you kill the easier it becomes to just
drench yourself the more you distance
yourself the less you will hurt the more
easily you can bring yourself to hurt
another
what it fans but you you never gained
any love nobody loves you
of course that doesn't mean you're
completely innocent or naive just that
you kept a certain tenderness in your
heart no matter the struggles our
hardships you faced you strive to do the
right thing you refuse to hurt anyone
even when you ran away you did it with a
smile you never gave love but you gained
love does that make sense maybe not now
you're about to face the greatest
challenge of your entire journey
your actions hero will determine the
fate of the entire world
if you refuse to fly a score will take
your soul and a story you mattered but
if you kill a score and go home
monsters will remain trapped underground
what will you do if I were you I would
have thrown in the towel by now no is it
I'm not sure he's me thing he would have
given up no I want to have enough it's
just a silly way to Frison this tender
moment so tender moment and I say the
goofy way it's like they want it to be a
joke no I don't think so
my you didn't get this far by giving up
did you that's right you have something
called danger when nation know it's hard
to for me to talk with enthusiasm
I apologize so as long as you hold on as
long as you can do what's in your heart
I believe you can do the right thing all
right we're all counting on you kid God

tell us to go back and talk to what's
the phrase or did we actually do that

couple times and bags stop hitting me
