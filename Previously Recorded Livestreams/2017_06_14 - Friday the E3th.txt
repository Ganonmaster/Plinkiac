um I'm starting orally because I can I
can do that that's that's the thing I
can do
wait a little you don't want here I'm
just gonna let start a match my keyboard
weddings I might need to I need to
communicate with people night might need
to communicate with people I'm gonna
play match then we could talk
return to let's push the talk off just
forbid means I'm not gonna talk another
chat much because that could be
confusing so change the settings and
let's go apply here's the plan tonight
just just before I get into a match and
start a game we are the plan is to talk
about e3 tonight me and Jack Jack's not
gonna get here till 6:00 and he's got to
leave by 8:00 so I just said you know
I'll start streaming early so I started
streaming early so I'm gonna be playing
Friday the 13th till Jack gets here then
we're done and we're gonna talk about e3
um see how part of this oh I would I
don't know how feasible it is I wanted
to start a private match with the chat
with everyone in the chat but I got a
private match here and it's there's not
I can't like set a password and it's not
like rocket League where I can just set
a password so I I have to invite people
which means you would need to be you
know playing you would need to be my
Steam friend and have Friday the 13th
that's the problem with that
and only like 13 of my Steam friends
have the game so I don't I don't think
it's gonna happen but you know what I'll
stream for a bit
once everyone knows what's going on I'll
play a couple of matches and we'll see
if there's enough people in the friends
list who are playing Friday the 13th so
I can invite them and we get a private
match we'll see
we will see till then I'm just play a
public I guess it'd be a public game I
don't I don't know multiplayer talk each
other just get in the closet
yeah
Messaging what that's all about check
that well Jason's killing somebody here
oh snap yes I know I know my mic jacks
got this inverted again waste valuable
time on inverted the controls there we
go we got a shotgun and a shotgun that's
gonna give me much good
what do we got the garage wait we need
something if you need car part boat part
I don't care
need to find something so we can start
on a plan of attack or escape useless to
me nothing useless
maybe I'll have more like over here
that's her stamina like usually is that
rocker chick she's pretty good
walkie well it'll be better to say this
for the folders but whatever you just
check that very far house back there
yeah
well no the other side like deep down
this road who is chasing the Jason he
stated they're competing Brooke
yes yeah but there's also this back out
I remember fixing everyone you know I
decided I would rather have push-to-talk
off makes it awkward if I want to talk
to Chad all right I don't know I don't
know what the hell's going on everyone's
on the other side of the map probably
try to find car parts I need to find a
fuse I need to find keys
cuz I'm kind of on my own over here or I
need to need something to help get me
out of here yo he's next but she did the
horizontal ourselves
I know he's dancing me the easiest thing
to do while he's in there I might be
able to chitchat I might be able to talk
about what I'm doing here but having a
conversation with you he's next to the
first car station shaggy in this game
Noah Scooby know what a scooby-doo mod
would just be awesome way oh my god oh
my god instead of killing Jason you have
to find a whole bunch of clues and
unmask him that's a fantastic idea of
who's a spinner what is rich looking for
something something to help get me out
of here either I'm just kind of the
whole thing
no Kimmy scan is only something easy
isn't it the West
Panda
easier abbis nice
mmm-hmm yeah he's here again the secure
house
lousy mmm
need to find a blender eight
walkie-talkies nothing he's got one more
left which would have bad stamina oh oh
I'll say slow speed maybe average
stamina a little bit alright a slightly
below average stamina not if you got you
but yeah I will say slow oh we got the
battery we got a gas tank I think we
just in the key somebody we got the
photos okay so go to this four-door car
and
I think I'm gonna search for keys in
here then I'm gonna head towards the car
maybe maybe I can find myself community
I'm running ok some go anyway just wait
up beats yep
alright they big OD
ok could you pick up the guy you on the
cursor up him captain thank you this
okay and go go back go back
come on start the car I'll distract them
start it this start started I'll
distract him
start it
oh if he if he is then he's dead to the
ground
Oh
pieces of Center it's pretty lame
pretty lame match three anyway
yes I lived yay how did they kill him
they didn't kill him I think he glitched
Jason probably glitched out of the game
I've seen it happen oh not with those
pings
why is this game so buggy because it it
wasn't made by a huge triple-a
development studio it was made largely
through a Kickstarter it's not terrible
all said one
but I have I paint on though Oh set up
for Jack this is Jack's Jason I'll take
it
they are here Jason fine she's not a bad
one phone car and the lights
you can break the door before they get a
chance to barricade it it's not a
terrible idea
ask me quicker
if he wants to run through broken glass
it's fine by me
ya feel for my other worst
oh good you may already have gas in it
where where be they
get up Jason find them heal them this is
now the Jason I would have chosen
no matter what car or fuse you can never
smell dangerous
I think
yes
you cannot you can never die
ah terrible
you got a pocketknife you don't
that's my Jason that's my special
special boy
I hate this Jayson shift sucks
that's my boy
hunt them down make them pay
and I can't scan around in the water
this is Jason shit water speed yeah I
don't like I don't like part to Jason
that much just shame I'm him when I got
to be Jason six or three those are my go
dues that's a freaking game of hide and
seek
oh the power generator still on and it
was out
really they have a fucking cheater
all right we need some daggers
how's this cheating because you're not
supposed to go onto that bridge Jason
can't get under that bridge
like another dagger or two
there's more daggers usually all over
the fucking place
now fives gonna cut it if they got a ton
of healing sprays
yes I got a haircut I might also have
had hair I took my hat off\
see this is this is why this is cheating
so what exactly do you get out of this
what's what's the benefit for you
like you don't get any experience out of
this just for surviving you you get the
advantage of don't not dying but in like
the cheapest way possible and you know
what I'm gonna not gonna disconnect I'm
gonna make you wait the full fuckin
match or kill you make them suffer like
the weak fucking horseshit so it's a
fucking good game but the players are
turning it to fucking shit
walk people fuck people so fucking much
we got a perk that's not ass sense
avoidance chance yeah you know I'll take
that I'll take that
all right um here's the deal if you are
one of my Steam friends and you own this
game start this game right now if you
want to play a private match
changed adjacent yeah yeah that's
actually a great idea there we go
I'll take me some part six Jason
something offer bet invite I find
anybody
I fancy
all right none of my Steam friends are
currently playing this game I only have
13 Steam friends who own this game just
kind of a funny number in it I think one
of them's Jack let me find out what's
going on with Jack
oh yes
yeah yeah I was just playing and
somebody was glitching under the bridge
in a game all right all right I'll see
in a bit
all right jack is going to be free
earlier than he thought
free earlier than he thought and I don't
see anybody to invite so I'm gonna give
up in this private match idea
maybe someday maybe someday we would
probably have to organize that advance
all right turn the game back uh-huh I
don't know what you guys see a list of
steam names I don't know I don't know if
people want that kind of thing being
seen all right
leave this lobbyist I want to leave this
private Lobby
yes I'm sure leave
your steam friend list is public okay I
didn't know that look I I very rarely
did the multiplayer things like this in
rocket god oh wait let me let me turn on
push-to-talk before i annoy everyone
yes I saw Mario Rabbids the Mario XCOM
game ah looking forward to it looks neat
honestly it looks neat there any people
on your friends list that have been
offline for years I check every now and
then I had one person who I unfriended
because they hadn't been on it wasn't a
year of his months and months and they
were like would you flip me oh really
they're like really sad about it even
though I'm like I'm never doing the
multiplayer thing I think they just
liked having rich Evans and his team
list even though they didn't use steam
that often and so it's like how how bad
am I supposed to feel about this how bad
did I see the Dean ballroom presentation
I'm gonna sing a lot of things for the
first time
that was that was the plan tonight
Justin digging to e3 where's the garage
found like gas in the garage before it's
a good thing no boat oh it's a fun way
to get out
she has the walkie-talkie perk I gotta
change that shit
to change that right the fuck out of
here
don't think I picked one up without
realizing it and we're heading this way
turn the flashlight on keep that fear
down pretty sure I gave her the darkness
fear resistance perk
let's pray all right
that's a shitty house
yes fear makes you easier to detect by
Jason like you know you saw that when
those people were showing up bright red
I I believe they're more likely to shut
them down sometimes they don't show up
and that that's related to fear the more
afraid they are the more likely they are
to show up when Jason Jason uses his his
detective vision might increase the
radius that they get detected from -
yeah and also I think things like speed
and your stamina decreases faster
recharges slower it's it's having fears
all around a debuff how many fucking
walkie useless completely useless walkie
talkies am I gonna find how many find
everyone that spawn on this fucking map
I find battery and I find car keys no
found eight walkie talkies
yeah you need
well I guess walkie-talkie right yeah
all nine shit check that the boathouse
we've got twin
it's likely been sure
terrible terrible luck terrible spawn
terrible everything
all right I'm not gonna wait around
spectating fuck that shit we're finding
another game Keith oh god yeah I know
that's that's an epic level perk but
yeah that's what you want that's the
shit I like starting with the map
they're easy they're easy enough to find
and six people is not enough for a good
game
at the campground there's a map sign you
can go to and just get a map from I
don't I don't know that every map in the
game you know every game map has one of
those signs
seven yeah yeah you know know somebody
always drops out of the start of a match
I want a full full fucking match Jack
should be here shortly
that time it was me though the match
hadn't Oh shitty pings all around nope
match hadn't technically started yet I
left before the match why so early rich
because Jack has to be done early if I
didn't do a bit of solo stream in the
day which is it was literally just gonna
be a two-hour stream
whoever picks the map pick pack a neck
lodge shut up not even supposed to be
playing this game oh yeah
that map has a glitch that lets campers
wallow glitch is that the one in the
cabin like by the moose head because you
can hit them with a knife I had to kill
someone that way once I was pissed then
too
silent rich stream is redundant what do
you what do you want me people what do
you want me to do dance like a giraffe
play playing a game we're playing a game
we're waiting for the game to start
what's problem
no I'm not your monkey
all right oh god what am I gonna do
that's right we dropped a map perk I'll
be fine I'll be fine
and Colin Tommy Gervais
nothing now we actually do need a map
and I'm gonna find eight walkie-talkies
when I don't I don't care if I find one
honestly unless there's a really good
group of people who are community
communicative who communicate who talk
it's useless you have to come to camp
Crystal Lake bring a gun anyone out
there you have to come to Camp Crystal
Lake bring a gun this is a prank we need
your help
Jason is killing us we need your help
you know what fuck this shit
have a really shitty day in this game
no rich you had to kill him then then
you know I've mess up he kills me
instead then I have to stick around to
get revenge or just find a different
match without a prick seems like the
community on this game was unfixable bad
it's getting that way it is starting to
get that way
people have found the spots on the map
or they can hide the Jason can't rage
who kill people on their own team for no
reason like that one jerk was trying to
do fuckin its best to find a different
match make them remember what they did
to us Jason
kill them
hey what's up dreaming yep
you're dreaming oh we're having a
terrible day here
it's gone what's going on everybody what
a dumbass so I have you killed anyone so
far you know roundabout way what I was
going to kill some girl on the idiot
shopping with a shotgun and killed her
robbing robbing me of a kill and him of
a teammate interesting interesting
yeah know we'll talk about all the funny
three stuff don't you guys worry let's
just enjoy what I think is a really good
game I've had some time to play it on my
own I think it's a really good game have
you one been running into a higher
percentage of of just asshole players
every you know today we've had to really
yes
Barry's a very come on I don't want you
and everybody here yep listen guys it's
summertime you get to look at my sweet
sweet ass legs okay that's how it works
oh I ran into the strangest asshole
yesterday yeah right before I play oh no
I think it was after I played with you
he was after I played with you
the police are called yeah and I'm
waiting by the exit yeah heard by one of
the exits you know and Jason is nowhere
to be seen so he's off fucking around
with someone else and so I had a I had a
weapon I had a bat and I had
firecrackers and I had a health spray so
I just can't kind of near the exit not
not right by the exit in case Jason went
over there yeah but I camped near
waiting for the police countdown timer
to get to zero and I mean I'm in a
campground right with help you forgot to
lock the door we're gonna get you we're
gonna get ya nope he's a tricky one
inspector he was trying to shut the door
behind okay so I'm waiting in the camp
area near there near one of the exits
and all the sudden poof Tommy Jarvis
shows up in the campsite yeah that's
where he was spawned and uh and so he's
like hey man what are you doing I said
I'm just waiting here police timers
countdown might be this exit if it is
you know it'll be an easy escape he goes
oh cool and you know we're both just
waiting there for a second and all of a
sudden out of nowhere he pulls out a
shotgun and shoots me in the back yeah
and it's just like what the fuck dude
and then I followed him you cuz you know
I'm dead I can follow
oh shit there's some guy in there and
even no nope so then I followed him
around on camera and he did the rest of
the round helping everyone else and he
was a good teammate to everyone else
except for me he shot me in the back for
no particular reason what the fuck is
with that
y'all anybody guys anybody ever know so
it was just it was a very strange
that was a strange jerk moment Tommy
Tommy Tommy was always unstable learn my
lore I'm sorry have a knife asshole so
anyway yeah sometimes you know I haven't
run into too many jerks I've run into a
lot of new people who don't really know
what they're doing but that's okay hello
Jason's here Jason's here
so the health sprays are in this map
don't let them
they're going for a kill they're going
for a kill they don't have the sweater
you can never die if you're smart you
get the mask off and breathe and think
about them
that's a good girl that's my boy hunt
them down make them say no you know does
nobody is doomed because of III but III
can be a good indicator on where they
are as a business
oh hi Tommy Jarvis you can never die
okay Lee Potter I just haven't checked
my email in a while don't worry well
we'll get any gifts nice shot rich
oh that's a great kill just slam his
head down yeah beautiful mother Wow
caught in a rock sorry rich caught on a
rock
hmm you know for example Summerlee III
talk before we get to the real meat of
it is Xbox to really announce any games
at least kill me with honor
yes slam his head into the fucking
ground
great
I feel like they had Anza Metro in
Pokemon way too well that was that was
Nintendo see again it's not ether he's
not gonna do many one it's damage
control that was a Nintendo doing damage
control saying listen we're working on a
new Metroid Prime we are working on a
standalone Pokemon game for the switch
yes yes we're working on all this
that's my boy hunt them down and make
them pay way the fuck over there what
you doing over there
waiting by an exit my guess Oh are the
cops called yeah oh we've not had a
great match well you got a lot of kills
right there
did I fix my switch yes my switch is
fixed as of as of the past
I don't know when did we stop playing
Zelda
sure a month ago
let's just say as of the past month it
has exclusively been a mario kart 8
deluxe machine for my children nothing
else has been played on that besides
Mario Kart 8 deluxe by my two boys
people left at some point so Jack you've
been getting better at this game I have
been well you know I've been learning
some of the intricacies yeah no
survivors
yeah fuck's sake good for fuck's sake
well one of them got shot two people
just left no survivors denno
I mean you kill you calms me up the
satisfaction you killed five of them you
did a fine job you did a fine job Ben
you know I've been I've been building up
some XP I still haven't unlocked Baghead
Jason yet no well I'm not at level 13
yet I think I'm at now he's not at level
13 and so okay I'm only at level like 10
or 11 are we doing y'all sorry through
stuff earlier now you play another match
I'm hello oh there's a lot of people
here so what it what was I gonna say why
don't you know one of the things I think
that this game desperately desperately
needs and I know this is asking wrong it
just needs more stuff why do you for
Maps there will be some other escape
routes some other escape right like you
know cuz everyone you know not all at
once you'd only be like every match like
has it's either the boat with the to car
to boat two cars it should only be those
like three methods but they can rotate
like they are well alright
and you know like a new fresh strategy
because so everyone knows what the
strategies are and after you play a
couple matches every
beelines to all the strategies and you
kind of lose that sense of discovery
that you get five sets of clothes even a
sweater what to think kick just get us
playing and that's possible
it's great I love it we're gonna have to
mute that kid that's fine that trap
no wait the kids don't huh okay oh man
hey what are you doing are you tell me
this I I came close to a Jason kill the
other day I've kept close like three
times when do you if you're Tommy Jarvis
when do you have to hit Jason with the
machetes got to be on his knees she
stuns him with the sweater uh-huh then
somebody has to knock him down hit him
once so he goes to his knees and then
Tommy Jarvis gets up on my mic wasn't on
because the game is really finicky about
mics and headphones and whatnot we
playing stomach and I was playing his
Tommy and we had his mask off and we had
the sweater and they stunned him with
the sweater uh-huh and I was waiting for
something to happen and so I just hit
him with the machete uh-huh and then
everyone started yelling at me and I
said what I thought I was supposed to
hit him with the machete so we had we
had all the steps there but we didn't
get him in time this kid's gonna get me
close I'm playing I'm playing stealthy
and Lonnie McCloud is running everywhere
and yelling into the dog yeah I need ten
on my flashlight game rating guys but
you know you press oh you can see your
front you can see in front of you
anyone out there I'm not gonna kill the
kid oh we can just mute him he's just
you know somebody hit me with a baseball
bat okay these keys it's great that he's
so excited about this oh I have no
problem with I found able to get us out
of here
I found the propeller I found the
propeller there we go you can do it you
can say it you can say let's get what
okay well remember what house the boat
partisan because that kids dying yeah
Jack what yeah no I'm well I'm also a
little confused on how some items work
when you die the other day I was playing
and I had the fuse and I died and I came
back as Tommy Jarvis and I tried to
search my body for the fuckers dead it
would be near the body not on and
somebody else may have grabbed it of
course he'd uh did you wait did you try
at all to fix the fuse box that's Tommy
Jarvis yeah no okay oh and as the other
person okay I'm still it uh as the other
person no I did not try to fix the fuse
box though cuz it would be in the fuse
box okay if that were the case no I was
still on my body but I couldn't find it
so let you know and I know the game is
kind of glitchy and so it's like
sometimes you just have to wonder is it
a glitch or am I not doing it right
which is it I think the kid died now the
kid didn't die but could do not die
right now does he still have his thing
he's gonna fuck up so bad on that oh
wait he is gasps that's not the kid go
back you have to go back to that house
and get the propeller Jason spot I'll
reach you can do this you can do this I
just I just moved you know where the
propeller is Rach I might with the
propeller I know where the propeller
lets me that's me I kept track I said no
I kept track of where the propeller is
it's the house to the light to the left
okay Jason okay what
did you guys see that
no they don't see that under-strength
what happened was a puppy with one
stream no it was not popping up on the
screen but we got to stop that for his
popping up in generation oh no all right
so we're gonna play a game okay let's
repair the boat and then you guys get
wait what I think the propeller is
around here I heard someone talking
about it earlier it's either in here
around here that guy permanent decoy had
it but he left the game okay it's got to
be around here I'm gonna look for
instance in one of the houses the
propeller is definitely in one of the
houses I think that kid was in was this
the house you guys were in oh wait wait
Richard was right there it's right there
where oh never mind sorry I saw the
wrong I saw the pot symbol and I thought
it was a boat symbol sorry it looked
like a boat symbol were it for a half a
second oh good
I can take the car
let's do that I have neither a hold T
I've got the keys no you know what there
should be an option to row the boat
you're right I mister I love the ants we
could find the propeller on that I'll be
good to you sends that it's decoy has it
equally had the propeller
we gotta find his body did they have a
propeller what about that house over
there were you in that house you were it
was one of the houses near that Camphill
Brook intersection we're going off to
find gas oh okay you're finding gas okay
the stream got whiter when I came on
Adams body okay head to the car Oh gas
is in the boat Jack he said okay Tommy
nice nice signaling I'm gonna head omid
was called so I'm gonna go ahead to the
book track okay no I got the gas don't
worry I got the gas you can do this rich
you can do this I believe in you
let me put the stuff in because I am the
Chapa so I'm really smart photovia I was
playing this in an on the gas has
already been in the boat though can't
find the propeller is that Jo Jason is
fucking with everyone did you that was
Jason who said you remember earlier when
Jason was like I'm gonna let you fix the
boat and then you guys have to fight to
see who wins
Jason is trolling people as I believe
what's happening so fun of I'm liking it
playing solo I've had a couple really
fun matches I've been having in general
a good time playing it oh there's
another trap bridge
there was another trap look he's picking
up all your things
Jason is supposed to be Opie yeah that's
the that's kind of the whole point but
he ran over your dead body but if there
you know like in any multiplayer game as
soon as you have people working as a
team you can defeat Jason no problem if
you have people who know what they're
doing and working as a team they can
defeat Jason does this game have one
player storm up no not yet they say they
are working on it but it currently does
not have but I would go for I would
story mark story is right
what you waiting for people to show up
oh that's nice
but
it's great you know like if you're
driving in the car and Jason stops the
car you got to get out and you know stun
Jason protect open open he left by there
are ways that you can work together as a
team to achieve your goals which is very
nice it's you know I think the balance
could use a little tweaking and like I
said I just want more things I want more
things to do because more maps would
help hmm and some more randomization to
spawn areas like I think I don't have
anything memorized but I think like
batteries or whatnot spawn sets set
spots how do you think mm maybe maybe
how do you defeat Jason the power of
friendship kind of you kind of like I
you working it's hard open there's Jason
they should give you more time to save
someone else when Jason grabs them you
know
look if counselors are playing like a
group and they all are armed it's nearly
impossible for Jason to get a a grab
kill right right you're watching that
that match I was I was just playing as
Jason and there's like two people every
time I grab someone I got hit by someone
else or even if you're using your weapon
people can stun you people can knock you
over people firecrackers like there's
all sorts of things you can do to slow
Jason down and if there's enough of you
working in a group it becomes actually
pretty easy to slow Jason down it
becomes hard to like you know get in the
car again but I think it needs a little
more balance and I just want I just want
more I want more options as far as like
the things you can do to get out because
right now right now there's there's
three right there's there's car there's
boat there's police or waiting waiting
it out which never works cuz Jason gets
way too powerful but as far as you
escaping this car there's boat there's
police and then there I guess
technically there's the super hard kill
Jason right but and sometimes there's
only two things in just car or police so
so what's what's what's the plan then
really well yeah once you're done once
we're done with this machen will you get
the XP I hope I always wait I'll get
that 500 XP man get ready and start
oh no no we'll wait we'll wait well
we'll hit the the be right back button
we'll get things set up and and then
we'll do a proper proper stream got the
vanquish episode edited today it's doll
done it's exporting at home right now I
thought I was gonna be here earlier but
then I said oh wait I had a meeting I
was supposed to go to I'm working on a
commercial with a local group and we
were supposed to get together to write
the commercials today yeah and I show up
and I'm like hey who's ready to write
commercials and they're like we forgot
you were coming today and we're not
ready for you I said all right I'm gonna
go home then which is alright they're
nice people but you know like they
definitely want to be involved in the
writing process which is perfectly fine
by me so that I mean I show up I'm all
ready to go and nope they're not ready
so so I went back home quickly I had it
all I had the edit all done but I just
needed to put music to it and render out
so I quickly did that before I came yeah
it's it's good people are gonna love
this episode rich cuz it's just you and
me bickering man it's you and me
bickering about vanquish fight no no
it's it's and it's all good it's all
good spirit it's all good spirit the the
tough part is as as I'm editing this I'm
trying really hard to stay impartial and
you know you and I disagree on stuff and
so it's like you like you know the
footage that I use in between the
segments that's just gameplay footage
where it's just like I need to make sure
I'm showing also like cool gameplay
footage cuz written you know something
that rich would really like in there but
I want to show this piece where it kind
of helps out my argument I tried really
hard to stay objective
hold on I've got fun I'll get to that
and and hopefully like the the problem
is it's it's a lot of me it's a lot of
me defending myself so I'm like I am a
little worried that it's a little too
heavy my end of it okay well but you get
the first two the first two minutes I
don't say a word
yeah the first two minutes is you
gushing and so I'm like maybe balances
and I tried to make sure all of our
arguments were well articulated that's
always fun
Godfather 42 wanted to know if any of my
work here at rlm had led had led to any
real editing work like if I've gotten
any commercial jobs because of my work
here at rlm and the answer is no it just
distracts from my real life as always
fire kill that'd be fine by me I think
they're talking to each other they're
fine
but in fact like I think none of like no
clients who I've ever worked with really
know about the stuff that I do on our
lab yeah you know cuz they they all just
see my commercial work and they're like
oh yeah you can make purchase stuff
we'll do that I don't even think they
know which is fine if it come I want
hide it if it comes up this work is very
different than my other work why is this
taking so long
yeah just fucking let him fuck around
yep yeah oh so yeah they're just
fighting up oh I couldn't get the hell
straight up took the four-seater for
himself he did like the convention still
having I think all of the presentations
are over okay all right we're gonna take
a little break we're gonna mute the mics
and do the be right back and then I'm
sure he will come back with all of our
e3 extravaganza
