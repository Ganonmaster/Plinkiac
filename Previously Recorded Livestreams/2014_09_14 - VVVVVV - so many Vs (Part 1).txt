hello and welcome and welcome to Jax
Sunday solo stream only not so solo what
because we have rich Evans oh my god
it's true right they should know you're
here
this is so weird doing this from home is
not even good I'm not even gonna be
playing a game I'm just sitting here by
my chair no I like is it gonna be weird
like talking to me without seeing me
maybe yeah it might it's fine everything
everything's gonna be fine it's fine
I agree rich is too quiet hold on I'm
gonna work on that I got a mixer up here
here's a little rich up volume here's
that all this volume all right now rich
and I should be at about equal volumes
testing testing volume volume testing
what yes what it's working it's
functioning properly all right so what
what magical game do you have for
everybody today I wanted to play this is
a game I played a long time ago and
recently got again it's called vvvvvv
gonna get this started up here so just
just six fees just six feet that's seven
you'll you'll see it on the screen
momentarily that is the title it is six
V's it's there and you'll get it once we
start playing it's the V's or spikes
these are spikes oh hold on I'm gonna
and I'm probably gonna have to mess with
the game audio
it's okay to answer the chat question
sadly I hated lifeless planet
it was terrible such a such a neat
sounding premise I thought it was gonna
be a just a short little artistic game
instead it was a extremely boring half
platformer
trailer makes it sound like you get to
explore this this planet and mystery of
why there's a Russian town in the middle
of this abandoned empty dead planet
instead of like ridiculously linear Oh
fucking fucking I'm sorry jack
I've hijacked vvvvvv to talk about a
game that I didn't like know I Jack away
I was doing I was doing the audio
leveling while you were hijacking so I
think it worked out okay so now the
question for the chat is can you hear me
can you hear rich and can you hear the
game you should be able to will see Rach
are you still there yeah I'm sorry
all right great well let's start the
game let's see what happens here it's
out of the way okay oh here is this is
this is just one of the most fantastic
games I actually have recently so I
bought this a while ago because it was
just you know a cheap game that I heard
everybody realizing and and I recently
bought it when they when they gave it
touch control to turn the terrible
insane touch control server uh I hate
touch controls yeah touch controls can
be the worst but this developer Terry
Cavanagh I really trust and he said that
you know he made it he made it work to
to his standard
and I'm not I wasn't really digging in
it and all it made me want to do is play
the game
ma how are you controlling this now then
I mean you know I'm assuming you're not
using touch now okay
I'm using my xbox but you know you get
more you could use air
there there are only there's only two
directional buttons and the change to
gravity bar that's it
okay that's some oh no up no down see
are in full control over Brenda yeah so
but it's just either up or down and you
can't change it when you're in air you
have to hit the next level okay
and so obviously if you
a little demonstration here this is why
spell vvv because the spikes
okay night idea let's say you'll see
that in a second but I will I love this
oh yeah I should turn the the streams
volume up in my computer just so I I
have stereo and I lose my mind oh my god
that would kill you I am I am curious
how much you're offline but yeah that's
fine
all right how's this for game audio
people are telling me to lower the game
body audio this should be a better jack
thank you take the birthday boy you know
you know will be really odd though Jack
what if I turned on the streams audio on
Micah PC and it was actually ahead of
where we are now
oh that would freak out
hey I found a shiny trinket you'll see
that in a second rich that's just part
of it like
well you know cuz you get to see it this
is this is just a wonderful game he did
this this guy terry cavanagh also made
it one of my very favorite touchscreen
games he made a game called super
hexagon for ios and android and it's one
of the best uses of touchscreen somebody
sent me super hexagon on Steam yeah it's
really good for such a simple game right
isn't it
super intense yes and it's just it's
tend to be a little less intense a
little less intense you can stand to be
less intense thinking about that for a
second
yeah so same that same guys made that
made this and the great games there's
great games
I'm skipping by all the cutscenes here
everyone basically there's a shipwreck
and I need to find all the survivors all
of my crew that's all this is saying so
there is a story yeah there is a slight
story I don't know if you can oh no no
keep playing
yeah there is a story I'm the ship
captain and we got caught in a storm and
I need to find out why excuse me crew
and we don't know where we are we're in
a magical dimension and that's it
and there's these little MacGuffins here
okay and we got to find them and that's
all we know
and so that's I mean that's kind of an I
almost feel like I want to play on mouse
and keyboard on a on keyboard just
because it I feel like it'll be a little
more this is one of the few games where
I feel like the amount of keyboard is
more precise which is all in my head so
this doesn't even a jump button here is
there you're just you're just falling
just falling following it up or down you
have to know part that's kind of the
great thing about this game is three
buttons left right and fall fall up or
down oh no you died it well you died a
while ago I guess but my perspective you
just die did I die a lot wait to see
what's coming up here this is
oh my god
see I'm reacting the things that that
happened like 20 minutes ago for me the
Jets perspect
exactly you're seeing that now is that
awesome like you you just you just
dodged a giant red thing yeah would ice
all these little Atari bad guys just
super great
actually someone modded I saw I saw
online someone modded an Atari to play
this game O'Dowd to play super hexagon
like an actual Atari with the graphics
it was hilarious
did somebody mod the Atari did not suck
listen it was what it was
there was nothing blocky and repetitive
blocky repetitive that's all we had not
even me that was before my time that's
all they had
sadly that was that was me yeah my uncle
had an Atari and I played it frequently
we had a my grandma had pong you know
just a simple game of pong and that was
the entire game with pawn we we actually
had a pong table like an arcade table
with a screen in the middle of the table
that sounds awesome
it was and and you have little rotaries
each side had a room yeah
I'm doing ng bucks
the trinkets I found gotta find the
trinkets okay so now I should be able to
show you
oh here it is here's the map so you know
fog of war style map where anything
undiscovered is engraved and basically
it's just now I just need to kind of
fuck about until I find my crew which is
super me okay it's you know it's way
it's falling into nothingness I think
it's needed one of those games that's
you know like a lot of platformers can
just be linear levels but this one the
entire game is a level and it doesn't
matter what order you do anything in
and what did that turmoil say
I'll see in a minute oh yeah yeah I was
bad
our first breakthrough is creation
look my thoughts on the thief reboot
where I I haven't played it it doesn't
sound much like a thief game when you
take out the steampunk and and the
Hammers you have Garrett with a
different voice to get some new it's
something different so many things so
many play the Steve game it takes place
in just a great world I love that
universe I've heard it's one of the few
games that get stealth right what was
one of the original games to do stealth
really ok I think it came out the same
year as Metal Gear Solid and they both
take entirely different approaches to
self beefless like a stealth simulator
Metal Gear is more of like a puzzle
thing like how are you hey you're
supposed to get past this guard well you
do this this and that thief they just
like give you the tools say go at it
okay I myself - yeah this is probably a
level I should have done later
Oh oh my god oh my god oh no a trinket
oh I wanted that I'll get that
oh I need that oh I got it
full why I got that ring video
so if you go too soon you just die
automatically was at home he had if you
had the top of the screen yeah
what does that mean oh my god I kind of
game
I got crazy lucky just right there
this is one of those indie games that
I'm genuinely surprised when someone has
not heard about it just because I think
it's so good it's so good and so
different you know and I've seen like a
trailer for this before I've never never
played it obviously right
I guess you know I guess it gets lost
there is like an indie wash where
there's like dude is too much are you
okay rich yeah I'm fine I'm just getting
a headache watching this oh no I heard
it well I I'm I'm a habitual Fisher so
I'm just visiting with a screwdriver no
no reason
mr. checkpoint oh I made it hurry I made
it
spoiler alert 7/8 how many times have
you played this game only only once I
played this game once maybe 2 whenever
first came out it so 2 3 years ago and
then I just tried to recently on us a
section you just did seems like it would
take a lot of memorization it's you know
it's it's all kind of intuitive you just
you kind of see where you know me having
our Katie guy yeah you someone in the
chat just said screwdriver so ironic
okay I saved someone yay
do they do anything or they're like
playable characters you get to play as
the red guy now that would be awesome
no that would why don't why didn't they
do that I don't know where is he I think
they just hang around yeah see like
easiest in here I could talk to him say
he says it's great to be back I can't
wait to help you find all the rest of
the crew it'll be like old times honk
captain that's it that's all I said well
that was informative and delightful
I think some of them might do something
oh my god I'm just falling into the
vastness of space
you finished a three on invisible ink
yet okay you mean day four
yeah not the last day of the the final
mission no I have not gone back to
finish that game of invisible ink
because we I think I've made the
unconscious decision to wait till it's
done
yeah well yeah I'm gonna what why don't
we have I been here before no not
unconscious decision we made the
discreet decision when we were doing a
live stream oh yeah yeah you see that
I think well you're seeing that like I'm
behind that it gets even fucked er Oh
what tricking yay so this is kind of
like an overworld area or you find its
you know it's weird it's because it's
all it's all like the overworld but then
yeah there are specific levels I guess
but it's all they're all connected it's
very very Zelda one where you know there
are probably some that you should do
first because they're easier but you can
do anyone at any time today and it's all
connected
okay so it's like an orgy you can do
anyone at any time just like that okay
okay
see yeah like you'll see like on the map
you'll see like on the map like the big
yellow section yeah and the pink section
is where we found violet and so now we
just need to find those are like the
stages
now we just need to find and need to
find some more people here
okay fine it be okay there's a wise
Vermillion here heya captain this looks
a little dangerous
really always says
probably warning me that this is like a
later stage but you know what oh you're
do you does it matter what order you do
it in I mean other than just your own
personal experience it's not like you
get stronger or something right do you
were no no oh no I think I did something
bad I think I went to a secret thing
that I wasn't supposed to go to him why
are you not supposed to do that yet I
have no idea what's going on I don't
know what's I have would it surprise you
if I said I hadn't no idea what was
happening
you're the vvvvvv expert you tell me I
wish I could I wish I could I have no
idea what this is it's it's a warp zone
don't warp zone you're at the warp zone
no that's what I'm
no wonder those things of you you're
warping around whatever whatever I don't
get I'm trying to talk here people
expect me to say things I got a buck
you're here now you have to say things
that's the rule you have to say things
so I don't drink
okay great where what why is the
question of the day so this clear the
map
this is the I should I probably should
have listened to that red guy when he
said hey when he said hey you probably
shouldn't do this
oh okay nice thing to bit portal no it's
this is clearly an 8-bit portal oh no
this is like four bits like this is not
yeah what would technically what was the
Atari Oh God who knows I don't want get
out of here is my question go to the
warp zone I'm trapped in the abyss
I'm trapped in the eternal nothingness
rich oh no wait I think I see I'm sorry
laughs I mean you should be I blame you
you have a map use it I did that's what
I just did I just used
oh I found a teleporter excellent
okay Oh No yeah this seems oh god oh
Jesus Christ
oh fuck did you just miss the warp zone
I did
no I found the warp zone but then I
decided just to try to go a little bit
further to see if I could okay to see if
I could like find something better and
efficiently yes yeah I don't think I was
but I guess I don't know I guess I'm
just gonna do this level this is all
kinds of fucked killer numbers
yeah there's killer numbers what
everything that's not you I mean any we
have opinion why numbers why not that's
so weird it's all ik it's all like this
is the area where it just came in right
now watch what happens when I go out of
that area
Oh
no and it's not like portal it's like
platformer it's just a really sick I
define I think they're referring to that
section where you're going into those
little teleporting cubes oh sure yeah I
guess yeah whatever
Jesus Christ
whatever
oh my god how do we get it how do I get
out of here
that's just bending bending my brain
what's going on here oh yeah Opie what
do you see that you just weren't a blue
room where there was floating obeys oh
oh yeah
since this game is they live game oh I'm
sure I'm sure he'll maj is absolutely
everything
this is what I have to do it
and I do this
huh it's over heaven you are very
helpful
I wonder fuckin Miami obeys I cannot I
cannot line down the obeys by the way
it's it's the recent discovery the obeys
are not a platform
where the sea is if you fall on that
platform between the two oh no that
wouldn't work
yeah no platform between the two obeys
and reverse and then get on the one
above the two a bit yeah yeah yeah I
think I see it that's right we're
sometime time-shifted from what I'm
looking at what you're doing that I I
don't know that I can give helpful
advice okay I made it to a teleport I
don't know if that helps
this is a dual solo stream I I am
actually at home skyping Jack yes yeah
riches riches just chatting here with me
because sometimes when I play and I get
a little boring because I just I just
get too into playing and so rich is here
for the color commentary look one of
these days we should do some kind of
multiplayer game this way
oh I mean absolutely maybe maybe you
could show me Team Fortress 2 oh my god
that would be the greatest
Jesus effing Christ
everything everything is terrible
thief the dark project versus thief the
middle-aged dark project for story an
atmosphere metal age for gameplay how's
that I like it that was that was a check
question Jack I know you don't know what
the fuck I'm talking oh that's okay
just got killed by train yeah that
happens
again I can see why you like this game
mr. mr. super meatboy the greatest what
what class would I be in Team Fortress 2
I I don't even know what the classes are
I I know there's a medic I know there's
a heavy I know there's a flamethrower
guy that's all I know
that's hey that's pretty good any of
those classes are good you know flame
thrower guy or the pyro is a really good
place to start just because his weapon
requires very little his role on the
team is very easy to understand you know
like you just burn everyone area-denial
is his dick I've heard I've heard the
medic is voiced by the same guy who does
uh Travis touchdown and No More Heroes
I like No More Heroes so bad bad reason
to choose a class
or the best reason to choose a class
okay what do I have to oh my god oh my
god yeah
yeah and I want that oh it's mistake
then huh it's a whole bunch of Miss
pac-man's yeah
everything is this seems like it would
give me a headache trying to do this
it's it's pretty wrong it's pretty rough
but you know this is what you do you die
you die a lot
I just need to get this timing right
rich is at home letting out on some
hotdogs now I don't know much but I know
it would be hard to let out on a hot dog
like like a clam maybe less out what
does that even mean I have no idea
I think out on a hotdog that Depina join
yeah hot dog I guess
because if that's the case who doesn't
enjoy listen out of a good out dog you
know okay
oh crap I I almost did it I almost did
it by accident
to
we're gonna figure this out I know I'm
gonna figure this out hey take your time
he's got all week got a week okay oh
okay I got scared
I got scared of the last layer can you
can you dodge the Miss pac-man's by
going back and forth on the same only if
there's that little entrance like
Naughton I can't dodge it by going like
that you know cuz she'll get me there
shit yeah I just need to figure out
there was a there was one moment in
which I ran in which I somehow escaped
all of them as pac-man's and it hurts my
brain so I can't help you okay that's
fine
there there is a best of the worst being
edited right now and then there's one
that's been filmed I I have no idea when
the edits gonna be done
I'm not doing that but it's not it's
it's definitely in the pipeline
yes yeah we just filmed one yeah and
another one that's big
I think what Stu was really happy Jack
how long are you gonna stay on this one
screen brightness I mean that's the
question give it up give it up Jack give
it up everybody everybody wants to see
more stuff more stuff see more areas you
just stuck in the same pink room getting
eaten by this Batman over and over again
yeah yeah
I suppose you could shut uh it's not
gonna happen jack it's not gonna happen
oh my god you did Wow
you found the warp zone yeah this feels
like this feels very end bossy for some
reason oh my god
why are you in some like difficult area
that's the head of where you should be
yeah this feels this feels familiar as
in like this is like the very last thing
you're supposed to do
and it is I mean it's very difficult
I'm also being attacked by hugs no big
deal just metaphor the visual metaphor
its laid out in front of us stuck in the
same pink room getting eaten by miss
pac-man yeah yeah I guess we were
Lessing out I get it now yeah
rich and Jack what do you think of the
attention you have received from the
videos and projects you have been a part
of especially in the last two to three
years you take that one Ridge yeah I'm
shocked you guys like this shit I'm
every day I'm surprised like this they
can like this no we keep trying we keep
trying but you keep watching herself
yeah that's it's been fun
there there's there's so many of you
nice fans that it makes it worth the
not-so-nice fans if that counts for
anything because let's be honest there's
some shitty people out there yeah
you're right Mario Mario I need to
hunker down but you know that those of
you who come here and chat with us and
enjoy what we do I we we really really
do appreciate it every single one of you
who has sent us games I want to say you
somebody sent me vvvvvv baby yeah oh
he's with me oh thank you
thank you to all the nice fans and you
know it's all the not-so-nice ones you
know we just blocky and that's fine
are you looking forward to Hyrule
warriors I am NOT I know really cuz you
you like you like the the whatever
warriors whatever the real name is
dynasty I can't dynasty warriors thank
you yeah I like the dynasty Warriors
series but I mean I also like that I'd
like to think that I've evolved some as
a gamer and as a person you can still
like old games there's nothing wrong
with that sure
oh there's using like a historical
context of those games right yeah it
really can't do that with Zelda no but
you know I for me it depends on price
where it's like I would like to have
Zelda themed levels and to take the
characters and mow down the hordes of
people um and you know like you'll get
to you know go in
the fields and you know do all the do
all the stupid stuff then that's me oh
that's right
this is like an escort mission where
he'll only follow you if you're on the
ground floor if you're on the ceiling he
won't follow you but if you're on the
floor to follow you so yeah there's
there's like this is a UH this is an
escort mission oh my god yeah it's tough
there we go uh so yeah I I don't know
I'm not terribly excited about Hyrule
warriors if it can be under if it can be
under 30 bucks I'll be down which of
course it won't be it's gonna be 60
right
yeah at least Mike did not get a picture
of me as a baby if you're referring to
the rich Evans baby painting I am I am I
am letting him hang that up in the
studio I I let him use that and one day
when I when I come back for it we're
probably gonna have to fight over it yes
that that is riches that he has so
generously you know hung up in the
studio
Mike does have a strange fascination
with with you and you as a baby yeah
yeah cuz it's so weird I get it I get it
everything about me is weird right every
time we bring it up there people who
don't know that's maybe yeah yeah yeah
it's it's me and and nobody in my family
remembers how we got it
that's the weirdest part I know I know
I've been a kid I can't I can't ask Mike
my grandmother my mother because they're
they've passed away right and my uncle
doesn't know my my dad thought my my
other grandmother did it so we pointed
out that the name on the painting says
he lamp and absolutely nobody has any
idea who the fuck that is
he'll am e the initial e lamp that's
what the painting is signed L AM P yes
okay Internet find the Vicent lamp
somebody who might have done a baby
painting integrator shape 1970s early
nineteen seventies in the greater
Chicagoland area
we will crowdsource this rich okay
hold on through some concentration
involved with this next maneuver you're
seeing in a second shit
a lamp just some some guy who did
portraits
haha also as it turns out I'm pretty
awesome in case you weren't oh my god oh
my god a game this game is a headache
now there are there are games that are
worse it's a headache because I get this
a lot I guess you have to go back and go
on the okay I got oh are you playing
with a slinky I fidget with everything
and I have a fidget I have a slinky
behind my desk just so I can fidget with
it yes I mean that's fair first it was a
screwdriver
now what's this lucky okay that's fine
it's just it's weird I my hands have to
be constantly doing something it's just
the way it is that's just the way it is
things are never gonna change no that's
just the way it is
I want to say that's a Tupac song I
don't know songs you'd speak gibberish
to make Tupac that's that's the one who
sells fruit loops right with the bird
with the nose shoot Tupac Sam absolutely
Tupac Sam Tupac Sam yeah is vvvvvv good
yes if you if you enjoy hard platformers
it's it's great it's you know every
every platform is a puzzle and as you're
seeing it's just as hard as balls and ID
so that's the kind of game I like is a
game that will 100% challenge me
can I go up here again let's see what
else is over in this area
or not
how many crew members do you have to
rescue I want to say it'll tell me how
long if I go I have to rescue two more
okay so six in total and then that's the
game or I have to wear after this I have
to rescue all six and then there is like
a super-dee-duper end level that yeah
just insane they start incorporating
trampolines into the mix
trampolines oh my god yeah it's it's
nuts it's just crazy
nothing there's nothing you're so stupid
would you guys ever consider streaming
classics nests or nests or blast
proccesing Genesis titles we we have we
stream Sonic yeah we stream Sonic we we
had an n64 stream we had a Dreamcast
stream yeah and we will have a
Playstation 2 extreme what we feel like
basically yeah yeah I know I mean I want
a Super Nintendo stream there's I have a
ton of Super Nintendo games that I want
to I just want to play turtles in time
know an entire stream dedicated to turn
over some time some Wii stuff I'd like
to do some Wii titles yeah I still I
still want to make you play No More
Heroes just cuz I'm I'm curious how
you'll react to it
mister I hate everything about stories
and games i hey hey now hey that's fine
i never to each their own Jack that's
fine we don't like stories and that's
fine I'm just wondering well how you
would react to know more of you're right
it's not it's not stories I know crap I
don't have a problem with stories and
games I like stories in games that helps
I disliked cutscenes okay because that
takes away from me playing the game
anytime anytime the game stops me from
playing the game I had a problem you
know and obviously sometimes it's a
sometimes it's a necessity and so you
put up with it but there are those games
that incorporate story and game
seamlessly and those are games that
iodine just extra love so it's not just
like I I just like story because I I was
I was musing that I would probably enjoy
it visible ink more if there were a
context what we were doing in that game
yy-your sneaking into these buildings
and and you know what I'm gonna go ahead
and agree with you even because
something as simple as FTL you know like
the it's a sentence your ear you have
information and you're running away from
the rebel fleet like that's good that's
great
was it with invisible ink something like
that would be awesome you doing down
here
I've been FC Elling lately always it
till that's the other rule always be
closing doors ABCD and it always FTL III
don't like any of the chain weapons you
just don't like a much chain weapons no
yeah I would in order to like them I
would probably need multiple chain
weapons and reload boosters automatic
reloaders juror sure then I might get
into it but don't I don't think they're
worth it you know sometimes if I stumble
on one of us I'm not gonna buy it in the
hopes that maybe I'll find another one
and some automatic reloading sure sure
you know it is it has to be a very oh
great oh crap
seizure warnings I guess oh yeah here
are the trampolines
these little white bars he'll bounce off
of a chat I'm not I'm not sold on brutal
doom doom doesn't need reloading guns
you don't you don't need to reload with
doing you shouldn't need that and a
stupid dub third-person camera kills
footpad even know what Dumas is is pure
and wonderful and it doesn't need a
stupid mod I'm sorry jack I had to go on
that tangent
I found a giant circuit no I think
that's funny
so in brutal doom they they have like
kill canvas uh yeah and and ammo you
have to fine
reloading like clips you have to reload
in brutal doom the only the only
modification to doom that I can really
stomach our sauce look I like mouth look
other than that
leave it alone mouth leave it alone Wow
that's where you can use the mouse tame
Dumas do was so old so was so original
that it didn't have that initially oh I
suppose because it was just left and
right yeah yeah
oh do me now Oh doom and oh your love of
you I've always found doing it to be
like again I understand that doom is the
granddaddy but I've never been into it
it's too ugly for me if you can't
appreciate the beautiful sprite art that
as bad as your fault
and it's your problem not mine
fair fair now there's gonna be a lot of
fucks a lot of fucks in the next couple
of minutes I sense that about this
I'm a shit hey we got a shit our first
shit
get some fucks in there
modern modernizing doom is like
colorizing black-and-white movies all
right you're against it I suppose like
via colorizing bla like movies don't
adapt it but sometimes modernizing that
can help
you know you take it you take an old
movie like like Sinatra's Ocean's eleven
right you can turn that into a modern
fun movie what's that's that's a remake
that's something different that was they
did that that was called doom three all
right it's a different beast I'm talking
Acosta Blanco and digitally ad in color
oh yeah that well that's that's doom
with with ammo clips and reloading and
third-person kill camps that's
apparently how you how you gain health
so it's not like you can just ignore
that feature yeah but that yeah dude--
yeah dude-- sucks
and a trinket factory
in a dialogue
yeah I'm gonna keep dying on it should
know everybody the chat is giving you
shit they're calling this silver spoon
well ever oh because you're here um okay
I get fair that's fair
I'm sorry I guess I don't know it's it's
not I guess it's it's weird cuz
technically it is a solo string you know
like it's just me playing and rich and I
are can't don't check them worried about
it oh I was just here's the thing I was
giving this a lot of fun
why do you call it Jack and a half
