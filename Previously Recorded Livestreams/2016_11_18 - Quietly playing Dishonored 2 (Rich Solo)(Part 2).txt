doesn't have am i here am i here hello
hello
far Fig Newton can you hear me all right
I'm moving so I'm not frozen back all
right good good this is gonna be a
crash' Palooza
out of curiosity last stream when Jack
turned the settings dumb game ran
flawlessly the stream went flawlessly
didn't it I don't think it crashed once
after that ah I guess I'm just gonna
turn the settings in the game down
nothing crashing if that's what's
causing it
shame it looks nice I like it I like a
look visuals van settings Auto very high
hi welcome medium yeah you know I'll
just go low well not will not even risk
it oh no nope I wanted to apply that
all right
it's fucking ruins all over
I'm assuming I have to buy it
what do we got
client could be recovered just a bowling
sleep dart
I'll take those
let's see I have some upgrade plans for
you here
it seemed pretty stable to begin with
it's the only thing I can just hurry
pistol gentle planning using that much
none of that super exciting grenade
mines
let's go for a range
does rich love first-person shooters I
don't know it depends upon the style
we're talking about something like Call
of Duty is talking about something like
doom oh yeah I love that shit
Gears of War was tears Wars quality it's
good vanquish awesome uncharted that's
like a shooter five minutes for every
hour of walking around talking to people
and pretending it's gameplay because
technically you're holding forward on
the stick it's a pretend shooter
Oh
a wanted man again welcome home please
give me no choice
oh wait have enough it's too late for
that
anyone asks
he just ran through
the grand guard should be addressed to
the nearest guardsmen
nope nothing there all right that's
pretty easy
more Grand Guard soldiers that's to
avoid
you asleep anybody don't maybe search
the whole place I don't have time for
that no I thought maybe they'd do a
Looney Tunes everyone pass it worth a
shot
nope nope unless yakety sax is playing
there nothing fast you look it was worth
a shot
oh this should take me out to the
institution I'm curious how effective is
just running past everything in this
game no but we're there alright so not
that effective at least not here
station this should take me out to the
Institute well why are you saving right
at a spot where I'm about to get caught
game
I didn't read any yet because this is
almost a bonus stream I need to play
this game and I'm focusing on this game
and I'm not spending a lot of time
worried about reading things I'm sorry I
might do it later
fire station this should take me out to
the Institute
we need to get in there I think all
right
don't great doing great station this
should take me out to the Institute
think I just saw something station this
should take me out to the Institute show
yourself
station this should take me out to the
Institute
yeah
where's that other guy
oh I hit the wrong button
I meant to goddamnit
this should take me out to the Institute
someone there
no no oh god damn it I gotta I gotta
learn how to properly do that Neal and
on people and knock them out should take
me out to the Institute
that's how you do it
right guy in there
all right a friendly there's a guy right
there too so fuck fuck me
yes we're doing great we're doing real
great Oh God
why do I select so much station this
should take me out to the Institute
what am i hidden what am i not hidden
tucking behind the fucking pillar what
do you want from me game I what I miss
about thief is the fucking light gem the
visibility Jim and you kind of had a
good idea how hidden you were like that
was a great time for that autosave when
the guys about to look up and see me
game that was great that is really great
forget about that kiss
yes at a Meyer station this should take
me out to the Institute
a terrible mistake from the past oh fuck
me
here I plan B fire station this should
take me out to the Institute
I thought I heard blood flies for a
second
fire station this should take me out to
the Institute
nope family I can't find a convenient
way around out of my health auto-refill
Abed I don't make this easier
stupid
an entire shipment just gone take it
away from under their noses idiots at a
Meyer station this should take me out to
the Institute
all right
you want to think it did yeah
did I accidentally
that's what I did want to go to medium
never been to that saloon Apollo's
shufai's Jason ladybirds
you can tell he's no good just looking
at his shoes it's kicking my ass
I just saw something
at a Myers station this should take me
out to the Institute
never
it's something to throw
there we go
yes--why usually hate playing thinks for
the first time on stream the adder Mayer
Institute is my best chance of tracking
down the crown killer Alexandria Hypatia
turned an old solarium into a center for
medicinal knowledge that's famous
throughout the iessons she's an
alchemist brilliant and dedicated to
helping the miners in Karnataka and
their families if anyone knows what
happened to Sokolov and where this all
leads
she will it's okay you enjoy watching me
fail well I'm glad
yep's prize stream boring stream cuz I'm
playing the game and I'm playing more
attention to the game than the stream
but y'all get the latch be fair I guess
there's value in that
who's around he was around let's try and
do this better more better er
arrange transfer Tatem I saw one of the
crown killer crime scene why do I bother
why do I bother
hey you let your friend die I'm just
gonna stab you
and Watchtower operations
anymore but you never know when the
Dukes gonna send someone out here to
check on the boy I got transferred to my
I saw one of the crown killer crime
scenes
whoever tore that old couples art you
were enjoying it so what do you think
I don't know coming back at dawn as much
as a blood on the windows
no no what
right click it's not the one I wanted to
hit in that particular scenario
anyone discussing a term are with nan
check that just making sure it's still
in order nobody comes around anymore but
you never know when the Dukes gonna send
someone out here to check on things
Zod he keeps an eye which rich rich rich
what what
oh and get up here without shenanigans
can I get up there
I can cool
that's more like it
all right how many people do we have in
here
no I guess they can't see me through
there how well there's almost neat
f5 f5 where you went up there before
no not that but not about me
our goddess
shut something unsavory going on I'm
getting good and drunk after
fuckers all of you fuckers
ah sorry it's a bitch
it's okay now head niche
what's in here it's just not much in
here all right
how do I switch to the sleep darts
all right
so I know what's going on in here that's
a bad door this is got to be a way
around
alright alright
let's see anybody in there listen here
what's in here
nothing nothing wait safeco nice 980
pays to read folks
what's that that quarter
nothing
someone got in the crown jewelers way
all right
I don't have time for no backstory maybe
later
I'm assuming I could break one of these
windows but I don't really want to
because there's someone in there be nice
if I could
I can't get it that one
err voices
alright alright
I wasn't upstairs
someone
or would come from
all right one guard we rolling down
there let's see anyone up here
don't say anywhere to freaking hide
either
great nope wait for a better opportunity
better opportunity
I've got the graphics turned all the way
down because it seems to keep crashing
the damn stream if I have the graphics
turned up it can look better than this
all right so you just go in a big circle
dammit
nope
too many in there oh shit
hey I'm still good for a while yeah that
one fucker didn't see me it would have
been great
just live no no this is all this is all
previously recorded
yeah you go there
oh well that once was a man from
I would say I'm going strong exactly
whatever
nope
kind of hates sucking it's not to my
liking
I started on hard now but medium as far
as the difficulty
there's too many guards oh my god it's
been near impossible to actually ghost
load why am i trying to go in there
everyone tells me I need to collect the
fucking rooms there's a room in there
all right the rooms can go fuck
themselves yeah I forget about the sleep
darts fair point
well I am and I'm why am i not murdering
everyone because I'm not Jack
look every time I try to just move past
somebody sees me as unlife unlike theif
it's it's never clear how well you're
hidden
up
Oh
I'm hungry
why are there so many guards
I can't go around that corner because
I'm sure there's 50 guards patrolling
around eight guys are gonna come down
that staircase is 20 around that corner
really want to get that room that's in
here I don't think it's going to happen
I can't pick one of those throw them no
it's not gonna let me do that
anybody don't make me search the whole
place nope that didn't work out
I'm not reading tips today because I
need to play I need to play this I can't
do that if I'm reading tips every two
seconds I appreciate it
maybe I'll read them before I'm done but
not doing it right now I'm sorry
could be fun but this is like 20 guards
around every corner I'm gonna try the
dart thing again because maybe maybe if
I don't hit the helmet like I did that
time it won't be a problem
somebody's down
whoever did this must still be around
we're must still be around whoever did
this
that did it
I'm not playing with that weird gaming
stick Oh for fuck's sake
I'm not hitting f5 because I don't know
I know I'm sucking but as general rule
I'd try not to save scum as a general
rule
is there
oh great
nope
that plan was genius
genius
I didn't realize that was a super alarm
I just wanted a distraction to lure some
guys out of that room I figured maybe I
could sneak up behind them as they're
going the other way and it realized it
was gonna be a continuous and serious
thing
you make sure she stays well cheese
in case anyone asks the grounds unless
it's on official business for the Duke
got it
well said dead-end
suspicious
yeah I guess it's fine wherever
I so enjoy watching history warp as
woman's past from the lips of one to the
ears of another and perfectly for half
understood poorly remembered in the
years to come the story of the crown
killer will be twisted and bent hammered
like soft metal by some cows a monster
and had to be put down by others a
victim of treachery preserved because in
the end you've found another way but
you'll always remember the truth won't
you no truth at least
look didn't quite mean to fall there's
something I'm missing here
what is this still a marker I did all
the things right I've got all these
bones arms it's madness that's where I
came down from
that's not really much in here oh well
I gotta say after 40 or 80 times this
bone shine bone china LED take out your
hat it's getting really annoying
yep that's worth a shot
take I'd you have bone charms around
rooms available take god yeah that
message may hold is always beyond the
bottom of the screen
what's in the door is it a bomb job get
the bug job we try for doors blocked oh
I can't I can't
door was blocked
the blood flies have gotten out of hand
here
anam
Vanja
nearby did put the drinking of the
center on my fucking screen every time
patience mine I'm sorry I I should know
that I'm here to ask you about something
do you cover your face because you will
hurt the afflictions we treat here are
more common than anyone likes to admit
I'm not here for treatment looking for
Anton so yes he was here for a short
time but she took him away to see Karen
Jim Josh do you do you hear something
what about the crown killer a patient of
yours or the crown killer that name came
from the newspapers I'm afraid I don't
oh yes the murders I wasn't done Bob
studying diseases found among whaling
crew wait did someone just call me I've
been forgetting things
the crown killer is an interesting case
I feel almost sure I could help with
that it's just I used to do such good
work and now my memory is failing me who
is that calling me excuse me
we don't get visitors very often only
one recently I forget
I've gotten something under my
fingernails again
all right well now one I didn't used to
lose things like this
what's wrong with you
yeah touch that that diseased patient
right in this filthy soap no hustle
covered arms reminders the first version
had caused horrible changes to our mind
it's too late for me but maybe you can
still save her she's a good person what
can I do in my safe in disease treatment
you'll figure out it I'm gonna make that
counter serum her help her
okay the safe codename is five five one
they told me I'd taste royal blood when
they took the throne
she's gone what happened
look that fucker
yeah you know writing hope I'm not gonna
complain right now those bugs are
annoying
I could destroy those mists it's worth a
shot
I was shooting at him earlier didn't
seem to be doing anything
and I worth it totally not fucking worth
it I'm just getting out here
shoot them with the gun is that what the
bullets are for they're also for
alerting every guard and the building
which is something I'd like to not do
all right it was worth a shot
window
do you
so how do I use some of those potions
I'm picking up
hmm
thank you
tea in lime all right
would you
did she shoot him he tried to strangle
me I had no choice did she probably just
did it I'm sure he didn't try to
strangle her that's great
god damn it why didn't I keep looking
nope no look the other way
where she go
where did she go that's not good what
not in there
how's it going she's going pretty good I
like this game
oh please inside
some tainted blood and heat the final
mixture ESCOs knows something this is
something we have to do which would be
neat
can you turn off the objective markers
in the sum assuming you can and again
purposes of the stream be being lost
reverie wouldn't be good but one thing
I'll say that I miss from the thief
games was just a mild level of detective
work like you need to find infective
blood now like I fire playing thief and
like love it were some kind of hospital
I would look for a morgue like I would
look at my map and see if something
indicated where morgue would be and I
would make my way there I know I'm gonna
turn this on there's gonna be an
indicated marker saying go ahead to the
the corpses and once again that only
works there's like a some way I could
figure it out myself in the game like
the level makes sense think there's a
map the basement the more trouble you
innovate like something like that I
don't know but you know well I'm
streaming this and since I need to get
through this game a little bit quicker
I'm gonna leave that on but it gets
points it gets points if you could turn
that off
affected body yeah
oh that's close to
disgusting
all right now I need to heat this right
a Bunsen burner ham something's missing
you haven't joined the game it's getting
my butt kicked earlier I'm getting uh
I'm getting my groove slowly but surely
you know let's Stephen Russell doing the
voice every now and then I feel like I'm
playing thief every now and then
whenever you hear that voice you're
sneaking around it's good times it's
just good times
no that's not the oh I wanted to knock
her out first don't worry I'm going to
take care of it if you need a place to
lay low for a few days come find us wael
trusting her awful lot
not quite Garret
all right seconds we just gotta get out
of here then
all I can imagine is people over there
he's a janitor as far back as the old
tube field Dennis that's too long
no oh there we go
at least did it
not bad not bad
once that watchtowers down
he's gonna fall over but I don't care
what the fuck was that what the fuck was
that
Wow well what blew up and what caused it
to blow up
ooh
Oh
there's just one I missed Oh God don't
want to bother
no let's just get out of here let's just
get out of here I was gonna get that
other room but yeah then again that's
mostly cleared out let's see if it's
gonna be a nightmare to get this one I'm
not gonna bother
yep nope it was not a successful blog
I'm gonna see what's in there
I'm gonna read tips later later I'm
playing a game not double teaming with
Jack tonight where somebody can read
tips the other one complain the whole
goal is I got a I got a play dishonored
that's the goal denied
I guess doctor my patients seeing
patients thief was almost vaguely thief
like for a second there nope not exactly
what I wanted to do
all right there stairs to go down or
something like right
so my mist
well that's kind of creepy
and that's uh don't want to mess with
that whatever it is we're not fucking
with it well that last room I can't get
it set a down elevator yeah
watching of the everyone is dead now we
get down there
there's just no way down well Gabi wait
I wouldn't be there
I was up here that deactivated the the
gate
does the elevator go down more that's
probably it I gotta get in that elevator
shaft think I've figured it out
no I figured nothing out
nothing has been figured out
let's go why am I stuck s place my hands
oh wait let's see if clever shit happens
let's see
now how do we wreck these controls
without falling to our course
I love it
they'll need new boots after this
nope fuck some mom
so anyway to go I know you can beat this
game without powers is there any way to
do this without blink I just used blank
for now if I get I got shit to do
everything here we're stealing
oh man I just pickpocketed a fucking
waiter a fucking dishwasher I am a
terrible person and I guess it's a
kitchen so there won't be piles of cash
sitting around
at times this feels very much like thief
you thought this game was broken as fuck
on PC maybe if you got a crap PC that
didn't work out so well that didn't work
out so well
now we're all he's my quicksave bad idea
that was a fantastic idea just didn't
work
I mean is let me make sure this is saved
I guess I'm not gonna do the elevator
routine again but okay this is a good
safe
up
really you know this is a kitchen
you're not peasants why is there a
freakin rat skewer is that actually a
delicacy in this world so definitely I
want just eat a fish head another rat
skewer though
you can't do it
what's that all right now if you're
playing without magic how do you get
dumped here without dying
no maybe let's try it now nope you
didn't die though oh hello
all right please yeah I don't like it
ready now yeah I'm ready yes let's head
out for the dreadful whale
all right I feel like I started to get
my groove on during that mission which
I'm happy about
no tricks are you injecting herself with
a flawed version of her serum it changed
her but there was an antidote
so she'll live if she remembers the
murders she'll have to deal with that
move to the house of a man named Karen
Jim Josh
The Dukes grand adventure brilliant
another genius just what we needed
all right
and I bet not bad I don't ever killing
anyone but that's fine five bodies
second I'll deal with that detection is
15 well it can't win them all well I do
another mission I think I'm done I think
I'm done
six of six rooms
miss a cup of bone shards terms but Dad
whatever paintings huh
so collectible paintings are a thing in
this game and pretty good bet myself in
the bank
I played Red Dead Redemption one I loved
it where I won the Duke store when I was
still a boy
they say the clockwork soldiers are the
equal of Karnataka's best fighters now
I'm going to put that to the test
rescue one genius and cage the other
before he creates an army of clockwork
soldier sir all right hold on one second
