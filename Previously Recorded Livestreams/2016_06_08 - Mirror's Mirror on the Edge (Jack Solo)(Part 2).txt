and we're back and we're back so now I
have changed it to negative fourteen
hundred milliseconds so here's what's
gonna happen
I'm about to hit close right now and I'm
gonna jump or yeah I want to jump and
I'm gonna jump so now tell me if that
did it
jump
how close am I Wow wrong
oh no now there's a two second two-way
not a but a my two seconds and my two
seconds in front of her behind my voice
is about two seconds ahead I'm going
with four seconds ahead really see I'm
getting I don't like this you are two
seconds behind the video now you said
jump now we were way then jump
that's weird so I just set it to
negative fourteen hundred milliseconds
wait
but they did not take but did it not
take huh no it's going to negative 700
can you set it to zero sure I can set it
to zero but I don't think that works
it's basically the same as before
that's weird your feelings everybody's
feeling zero let's just see what happens
if I put if I have moments is here can I
do that while I'm streaming I don't
think I can I think I need to stop
streaming again no no no it says it's
set to zero now okay so now it says it's
set to zero let's try that again if I do
jump and jump
I know
jump
pretty good no still whatever you know
what how do you roll again
Hey yeah my god oh my god
not that way by the way not that way
what kind of wavy gravy is this yeah I'm
just not gonna worry about it
the wrong button let's uh let's restart
this does it matter it matters sometimes
cuz I like to talk about what's
happening in the game
when their button to roll feel like
there was a button to roll but that
could just be me
I also feel like I'm going the wrong way
because I no longer see red arrows
everywhere gosh darn it
how
okay
left trigger just lands soft it doesn't
roll right nope that's what happens if
you don't press left trigger
all right
they do it roll is the Crouch slide
button just as you are about to land
okay
although only me fate some level up to
at least level three I'd really really
hold on hold on hang on I'm gonna look
into this whole rolling thing
Oh see that's the thing I didn't
purchase it yet apparently I needed to
purchase it all right hold close to wait
to point van
I've been pickin hold okay great let's
see if I can buy any of these increased
damage particulars can I know right how
much do these things cost
I don't whatever I got the wrong thing
now that's all that matters
what
what is that
but what is anything just gonna run
around the city for a little bit to see
what happens I hope everyone's cool with
that because that is what I'm doing what
thing what thing I want that thing
he roll I did it I rolled not that way
not that way
woopsy dupes okay uh you do Jack you do
I am doing me I'm just running around
for a little bit I ran off a building
and you know that happens you run off
buildings sometimes that's mirrors
that's what I remember from the first
Mirror's Edge is just running off of
buildings just this guy knows his Jack
Packard thank you for streaming 25
months in a row we really appreciate it
it's true we really do also did you get
to watch the new review yeah yeah the
what was the newest one
oh it came from New York and surprise
surprise Jay loves escape from New York
and I'm actually a little surprised that
Mike doesn't like it that much but I
guess I just kind of you know they agree
on so many things
you know I can see someone not liking in
who you
but it's fine I'm down with the format
in general
nice nice roll felt good about that roll
that was a good roll slide that was a
bad slide apparently
run run run ball nice nice roll quality
roll we got some quality rolls here
where am I gone and why
where and why these are my questions
right now we're going there
but I I mean I love escape from New York
it's been a long time since I've seen
escape from New York but I remember
loving escape from New York but I think
I'm a little more okay with schlock than
mike is what is this nice document so
that's my only defense I am why do I
suck at sliding so much because I have
to hold it down that's why
today just so many people I want to
punch or kick
ooh what yeah
okay
so I got a nut break this being an RM
second stinger I don't know what a
second stinger ii two means second
stringer I don't think I am a second
stringer I think I'm like a third
stringer I want to say I'm the fourth
banana if we are if we are counting
bananas not gonna make it I should go
down to the street and walk like a
normal person no
you're at least four I'm the four I'm
the fourth banana and Josh would be the
fifth banana out of five no I'm sure
we're all we're all equal bananas except
Josh and and myself we are we are not
equal everyone else is equal bananas
except for Josh and I Josh and I on our
on our own level once reviews
established jack will be invited on to
ruin it absolutely okay I broke it I
just jumped I just jumped it I just
jumped right off the the frickin
building right no Josh Josh doesn't do
anything like post or production-wise
really Josh josh Josh I got bananas
there the Waterboys yeah yeah probably
sometimes yeah I get it
no Josh doesn't do anything in
production Josh
enjoys movies
come on my planet nope nope oh hey close
fake oh come on I was right there Jack
coming I show like on sitcoms when they
bring up the kid in later seasons yeah
is this it this is on Xbox one Lord Bell
on this this is on next
Josh does like wrestling III don't
understand I don't quite understand
wrestling button Josh does enjoy
wrestling I did I'm ruining everything
for this poor lady okay great yeah yeah
I get it all right I got to figure out a
better way to get to this guy that
doesn't help
this is not the correct way to go Oh or
maybe it is nope nope nope I'm not gonna
make it I'm gonna give this one more try
and then and I'm gonna and then I'm
gonna move on because obviously I'm
ruining everything
am i enjoying this I don't quite get it
yet that I think I'm blaming myself more
than anything I'm blaming myself
anyway running I do want to stop hearing
this story I think this way and I felt
like this way was faster I'm gonna make
it descent I'm gonna make it this time
feeling good about this feeling good
about this view and good about this
feeling good about this there it is here
it is here it is here is
press X to parkour okay so now we can
get on with the act what's what's this
oh no I don't want to play around with
Birdman's around I will steal this
because I'm here okay
bird man heading back to see bird man
whoo
why is this supposed to be time to
anyway I could you know because it's a
logistics thing you delivered a package
where's Birdman again oh right right I
gotta go through the thing
I'm a member for fuck sake
okay
Bergman has a delivery run few these are
from the background the right trade yeah
sure why not it's great for face yeah
you know it's I'm getting I'm getting
there I'm getting there
pick up and deliver a package for
Birdman okay
with this
oh okay
whoa whoa can't go that way gotta go
this way what's that blue snapshot
shopping
well that somersaulting is gonna cause
me to barf is it has any how is it how
is everyone's barf meter at the moment
has everyone's barf meter full
boom boom that's great
rich is on vacation so just a jack it's
all scream no barfing yet this dickhead
the kid
what a dick kid okay where we going now
where we going now
seems like there would be a secret in
here I don't care about no doors one of
these things what is it I don't know
it's a great leak it's one of them grid
leaks of course oh I have an upgrade
points okay
damage protectors it's back let's get
that one that all incentivize me to use
the know who she was okay
now what are we gonna do
did the game get interesting it I it's
you know maybe mate I'm gonna talk to
Birdman again talk sit back in the game
what
it's a kid what this who dis no Colonel
rush mustard I think the wide field of
view is making it seem a little more
natural bit so that's what they usually
say is in first-person shooters you want
to make the fields of view as wide as
possible would you recommend buying it
so far no not necessarily yet that's as
best as I can
that's as best as I can say is uh you
know maybe not yet but I know
I want that
every role there is a new Mirror's Edge
this is it it's Mirror's Edge catalyst
and yeah that's what my guess is my
guess is this will turn into one of
those you know free on Xbox Live and PS
network games because no one bought it
again just like no one bought no one
bought the first one and everyone was
really upset whoa let's go yeah I don't
know but I like it
these cannot go oh I uh most fell to my
death
great great
is this one with 90% more drumming no it
looks like it looks like approximately
the same amount of jumping that's what
that's what I am going to oh that's the
fan that keeps killing me well what's on
the other side of this fan yeah I need
to have a look at my enemy know thy
enemy
see I just wanted I just want to get in
there
well welcome jarl ball and swagger glad
I could forget
yeah I hate that prereq stuff doesn't
show up on red letter media front page
for days if every you know sometimes it
does sometimes it doesn't it all depends
on the really-really schedule if we if
we have a video that comes out you know
soon after one of theirs we want to pace
it out a little bit more skipping okay
there's a lab
all the labs downstairs
forgotten I forgotten I forgotten
everything already I do not know who
build the Arlen website nope I assume
one of them oh I assume one of them
dudes did turn on runners who Jack I
need the game to tell me what to do no
you know what I have I'll tell you that
I I do I could like this game
considerably more since I turned
runner's view off now that I can kind of
like choose now that I have some sort of
choice on where I run and jump I do feel
like 100% better about this game rolling
rolling though is tough on the stomach
excuse me Oh where you go oh sorry hey
dude
okay great
glad I could help what do I gotta get
but what do I gotta what whiffing this
game make freerunner Cemal any less
douchey no no shockingly enough even
though you are the hero of the game
you're everyone still kind of feels like
a dude what hey
the lens effect make these guys
constantly look like they're doing
Michael Jackson leans oh sure also why
wouldn't the fascist governments just
get rid of all of these hallways that
connect to the building because that's
how we're getting from building to
building is every single building has a
whole way up on the 100th floor
connecting building to building skip
skip free runners are douchey because
they wear stuff like this look at what
this guy is wearing that is not cool
that is douchey why are you wearing that
where your sleeves don't your arms get
cold
he does look like the arrow and the
arrow kind of looks like a dude
no no that was not the correct way to go
I was I was thinking it would look cool
if I if I jumped on that piece of Modern
Art and as it turns out it was not cool
because it killed me it killed all of me
all the time
yay whoa stop thinking creatively and I
know I know
that guy's leaves does not I mean he
does not mean does not look cool okay I
gotta find a way to get up
we're trying to get up here and I'm not
finding a way to get up I can find
plenty of ways to get down I want to get
up here okay I think I can make it
across
nope nope nope nope we're gonna fall
okay didn't follow
Oh close here we go here we go I heard
the animation when she can't climb up a
wall she looks like a cat I can't go in
after a laser pointer
whoa whoa find an elevator find an
elevator find an elevator that is a
refrigerator
the elevator is usually really close to
the refrigerator right if I remember my
architectural school Oh Ariel Ariel I
remember my architectural schooling you
always want to put the elevator right
next to the refrigerator
that's like design 101
Oh
okay try it again
try that again I got these things here
that look like steps so I'm gonna assume
that their steps so did the fact jump go
over here okay so we can make it over
here and I missing something over here
what am I missing
yep
don't big ol pile a'dope fuck
why didn't they make the protagonist of
the game some sort of modern engine
instead of just Park or losers yeah you
know it's fine I guess I kind of like it
that the combat is in the main focus the
game kind of makes it a little unique
okay
this is definitely the way to go I say
to myself not really knowing if this is
definitely the way to go we've gotten
here before I'm really close to
something and I'm really close to
something you know I mean you guys know
obviously if Aaron's says tipping now in
case I barf all over my keyboard later
yay
rich is on vacation rich is out of town
he ain't having none of this I probably
can't climb under those can I yeah
forget let's try it oh hello
look at that
hello
nope I'm gonna go full this way here we
go
well you know what that was that was
friggin clever right there that was
fully frickin clever
oh the only tip I have for learning
anything is just keep doing it just keep
doing it over and over practice every
day
I barely learned how to play the bass
myself I learned hello you know I've
read tabulator I never learned how to
read no it's like I could just read tabs
so just practice every day that's what
they say do it every day if you do it
every day you'll get good at it I want
time you know
practice every single day that's the
only thing you can do practice practice
practice find songs that you like learn
how to play them and play along with the
radio
Oh
- to do
oh my god where am I going what am i
doing I forgotten here we go
oh here we go look for the thing you can
kick learn scales and and provide and
improvise yeah you know just you just
got a play got a play she just got a
plan once you you know you enjoy it
obviously that's why you're doing in the
first place
so just find a way to connect you know
continue enjoying it that is not and oh
I don't care
hello all right green things green
things usually mean climb right nope
nope nope nope fuck is there no way to
learn there is no way to learn you do
what you enjoy doing no no what I'm
saying is obviously you enjoy music
that's why you're doing it in the first
place here we go and so learning it will
be easier because you already enjoy it
it's harder to learn something when you
don't enjoy it shut up dickhead
you know here we go
there's somebody here though I go
through this door no
okay there's a splinter cell here
Oh Oh oh-oh-oh job jump part yeah I'm
doing this game of shot if we get bored
of this game I can always go to dusters
I also have I mean Nick would play some
overwatch I don't necessarily want to
play overwatch mostly because I was
playing earlier today and I wasn't I was
not killing it I was not doing that well
so
I can hear the person in the background
it's glass
do boo
Oh cutscene I have been super enjoying
Symetra by the way in overwatch she is a
great defensive support character I just
lay down a thousand turrets a thousand
centuries and give everyone a mobo you
know the teleporter obviously mega
overpowered I mean she's my supportive
choice
there
this game has too much but what not
enough
there's some sick kungfu in here
all fun an escape sequence I don't think
he was a weak ninja I think she was a
unenhanced
focus shield with me dodging bullets
okay okay what did I forgot what focus
shield is again I should probably learn
these things yeah
No
excuse me
I died great uh are you going for a
no-kill run J I don't know what I don't
I don't think I can kill people anyway
so yeah press X to run and/or park car
focus shield
he just needs a squint and flex your
butt cheeks there I see I just did the
same thing twice
ok I think focus shield is right trigger
if I'm remembering correctly
that's what focus shield is right
trigger I have to remember these things
ok so we go like this this
okay shielding
morph
the bar for all
no no no
son of a bitch you know just son of a
bitch sometimes you get up the fuckin
thing thank you thank you
what
where the fuck do I fuck
son son of a damn it bitch so apparently
this is not the correct way to go
jack is a fan of the era what do you
think of the fact that the arrow
subreddit is so displeased with this
season that they became another
daredevil son a subreddit that's very
funny
yeah this season wasn't the greatest but
you know what were the it's it's more
shocking to me that anyone was like
really a fan in the first place you know
I begrudgingly liked the arrow if
anything if I was the flash the way they
ended the season of the flash this year
just got my blood boiling
okay we did it
what do I think this game needs so far
it's fine
so far it's fine that's what this whole
thing is about it's been part coring and
fighting I do not want flashpoint
paradox
I love daredevil the Crimson Viper
Daredevils great like daredevil like
Jessica Jones really looking forward to
Luke Cage and iron fist all that well
the Netflix shows Marvel shows are great
skipping a cutscene
okay
I got some kids whatever that means
Punisher show could be amazing also
could be terrible you know I I don't
like the Punisher in general I think
handling him as kind of a villain works
very well I don't like him in general
stun advantage fiber weave
Oh
Oh or quick turn
okay great
it is you're right it is time to stand
up everybody let's stand up you know
every every everything up until
daredevil season 2 has focused on you
know the Punisher as focus I'm death
wish
basically all right oh I'm stretching
out do a quick squat squat it out
stretch it out screw you dude
shout it out loud so so every move my
microphone really quick get a little
more comfortable here okay ever every
Punisher show up until daredevil season
two has kind of focused on the Charles
Bronson Deathwish which is you know like
making sure that his killing is super
justifiable and finally in and daredevil
we just get to see him you know
murdering people and maybe he likes it
you know sure it's it's his family was
killed but he's also just a loose cannon
and I really like that and I don't know
how long they can stretch that out into
his own show so
I don't know I don't necessarily we'll
see it's all a big we'll see
I think there'd be a secret back there
war zone you know what I still haven't
seen Punisher war zone I hear that's the
one to see
yes I know the Punisher is Charles
Bronson and I'm saying I need more of a
character than that see here's another
fan but I think I'm supposed to go
through this one
look I just murdered that person hmm
weird I don't feel bad about it
no next Furyk will not be about
uncharted or Mirror's Edge probably we
just did the first four hours of
Uncharted and we barely made it through
that I will tell you that much
we oh I just posted our first four hours
of of uncharted 2 end it is it is not a
joke that that rich was quite literally
covering his face with a pillow to keep
his sanity during during that smack like
a peanut hip oh thanks just this guy
yeah you know it was that uncharted 4
was so much worse than what we were
thinking it's it's just so so bad
so must buy its man we we hated hated
hated uncharted for and I just don't
think we could convince ourselves to
play it anymore so it won't be that it
won't be Mirror's Edge we I have an idea
actually I like I have a couple ideas of
stuff I want to do one more important
than the other I have any I haven't a
couple ideas for some fun ones some ones
that I'll be a nice mix of hate and
justifiable criticism and one that maybe
nobody will like but rich and I will so
it's it's uncharted it's unrep a
particle it is what it is it's it's the
fourth in the series everyone knows what
they're getting at this point there's
not much we can do with it there were
some good story elements but all the
gameplay was boring and you know it was
it was it was just just so dull all the
time
I ran into Gabriel
yeah that's true
and you know what maybe we learned our
lesson with metal gear so far I'm liking
mirrors edge better yeah I there's an
vino because there's an actual game here
like I'm doing stuff I'm in control with
my character and you know I get to have
fun with that shit you know like I have
consequences for forgetting to hit the
fall button and
you know it it's tough because there
they're trying to work within the front
you know the the framework of the game
is parkour combat and they're trying to
get a story in here and so everything is
story based where it's like oh oh what I
want to do is parkour in combat if they
could chill out with the story just a
little bit
nope who's shooting now I'm shooting now
I'm shooting now
who's shooting now fuck fuck fuck okay I
can do that better I can do that better
I believe in the power of me and I can
do that way better I just saw always
wanted a game where you eat dinner on
the couch with your wife
realism it's it's one of those things
where like I get that they're trying to
like give you some motivation to do all
the cool stuff but yeah I just kind of
want to get into the cool stuff and it's
fine everything's fine so far
so far I'm liking this hello excuse me
friend deal with this bitty first that's
yeah go down the steps whoopsie
nice
okay
like I'm kind of liking the combat the
combat does still feel like an
afterthought but also I probably like it
better if I didn't suck so much at it
but you know that was fun that was a fun
whoa I have no idea where I'm going I'm
just trying to get away from their
scanners Oh hope that that fence was not
there go ahe glitchy alright
I'm not to say nope I'm in their sight
again now to say great
I'm gonna steal some shit while I'm on
the run you Inc don't think I can go
there great
but not really because gameplay
what uncharted 2 has you kiddin people
within 30 minutes they really destroyed
the gameplay - cutscene ratio I I did
some math I hated it for uncharted for
all of all of the these every time we
played then I broke it up into game put
game play cutscene and other it's 58%
gameplay 30 34 percent cutscene and and
8% other which is pretty astounding
hello okay get out of there
like oh oh I just I just knocked him off
a motherfucking ledge I just killed
another guy that can't that can't be
okay
I can't be okay that I'm just murdering
people no those were not made up
percentages I've really figured out
exactly how much it was oh oh I'm on a
pole
apparently I'm on a pole what was the
other the other was walking down
hallways there was a lot there was a lot
of walking down hallways that what
they're real that technically was game
play but there was nothing to do in the
hallways you just had to walk from point
A to point B and so I felt it felt wrong
describing them as game play but they
were also weren't technically cutscenes
so I wasn't sure how to how to
categorize that so I just categorized it
I've been here before I have fucking
been here before how do i how do I get
home
where is this this is me there's a
hackable billboard
so what
okay I'm looking at a heck of a bill oh
okay on rails gameplay yeah maybe that's
a good way to describe it on Rails
gameplay but there was nothing like you
were just walking down a hallway so so
that was the other everything
interactive is gameplay yeah but is it
gameplay if there's no choices is that
it was the question for me like
prereq is the number-two streamer of
this game oh well there we go
you know that means nobody's streaming
this game oh okay I have a mission now
there there are want to get up this
building there's a hackable billboard
that I want to hack need to figure out
how to get up here not doing a great job
it's just very boy it's it is very
boring game well I still I felt more
comfortable categorizing it as other and
I was pretty generous like there was
some there was some stuff that was
clearly not gameplay but technically
speaking you could move the camera and
so I counted that as gameplay because
technically speaking you could do
something look I'm a mime I'm a mime and
there's a glass wall the flame in the
flood was more fun to watch yeah I'm
glad you enjoyed that oh hey I pressed
the button I pressed the button
no yeah yeah purple space bazooka rich
rich really hated uncharted 4 and yes
gronke people knocks the flame in the
flood is great is a great game that
everyone should buy I've really enjoyed
the flame in the flood had a couple
really good I had a couple really really
good game so that
had a lot of fun playing the flame in
the flood I don't exactly know how I did
that but I did it so that's something
played the flame in the flood music /
doom and see how much the tone changes
that'd be hilarious I'd be great hack
billboard
look at all the people I like that like
other people on the ships
it's neat world Oh
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo where where I don't
even know what am I supposed to be doing
that oh I have an upgrade point sure
easily from there okay great
oh shit
too far I think I've talked about this
before Sarah Chen Harlan our lack is my
usual online name and that's because
when I set up like one of my first email
addresses oh shit okay
my wife's nickname in high school was
Horrell from for Harlequin and I'm Jack
and so I thought because we lived
together at the time I was under the
impression that everybody was supposed
to share or that we would share an email
address much like we share a physical
address oh excuse me um obviously I did
not fully understand how email worked
yet and so when I first set up our email
address it was Harlech and that name
just cut
oh it's another thing I kind of get
what's happening I kind of get what's
happening it's super cute story
and then I was just kind of turned into
my nickname and spin my emails for that
long
I feel pretty good about our safe houses
this way I feel pretty good about that
combat think I'm killing it not that way
not that way how do I steal II probably
should be worried about getting out of
here but you know you got a steal a
thing when you when you when it's time
to steal a thing okay
okay running running how do I get over
there
that's the important question how do I
get over there
Oh
take here the gun guys first figure the
gun guys first kill Pete
there we go go and off we go
well stop for stop to steal a thing shit
shit
this is not working
okay this way I want to go this way
every time every time you jump I hear
like a little zip as if like that's your
bodysuit you know like it's like racism
who's that save us
a safe house so lots of valuable data
gets stored on roofs in the future yes
apparently apparently what's that I want
to see that thing I want to see what
these things are
concrete Canyon
they raise sure sure we'll play race why
not Oh hero
oh no I lost the arrows there
oh fuck not gonna make it
plus all my stars
oh we can do better than that we can do
better than that he's just pulling out
the circuit breakers to be a jerk yeah
like I don't I don't think like I'm not
I don't even remember why I'm pulling
out those circuit breakers but I see the
thing there and I press the a button so
I'm gonna do it that's you know
concentrating
concentrating
I can atleast get two stars okay that's
pretty good I feel good about two stars
does this have multiplayer if there is a
multiplayer component to this game I
have no idea what it is because they
asked me to sign into an EA account and
I'm just gonna refuse to do that I don't
know what it is and I'm just don't want
to so do you get that the yellow walls
are for wall running or at least they
were in the last version of this game
colonel rich mustard I think I get that
you can kind of wall run on any run
Waldo see you like that
you can kind of like and then jump so I
don't think it's it's just the yellow
walls I believe it's any wall
oh yeah I see him what's worse ei or who
be stuffed accounts I was very I was
very concerned when they asked me to
sign into an EI account and I knew my
email address and they said they asked
me if I had an account I thought I did
but apparently I didn't I was very
concerned pretty sure the man was on to
me you can never let the man get on to
you it's rule number one rule number one
of the streets whoa but I'm giving you
all the rules of the streets I need to
figure out what I'm doing here where
there's so much stuff to do and do we
want this
sure do we want this is the question
I'm going to say we do so let's go get
that thing
damn the man absolutely I should slow
down and enjoy the roses fuck you and
your roses roses look pretty exactly two
days out of the year the rest time you
got a stupid as bush with thorns on it
OOP there it is how do I area how do i
how do I
I've upgraded some things I can probably
upgrade more whoa
where's that crossing here is
I mean it's probably something up here
right probably looks like a neat little
hidden area I'm going to oh okay that's
where I need that can I upgrade again I
have enough points I don't if I had that
90-degree turn I could probably hit that
and right is that what the game's
telling me want that ladder
oh whoa
well almost died
oh I know II okay great
there's also yeah these little like
glowy things all over the place I don't
remember what those are for exactly did
this go the other way that's find out
nope nope the answer is no what okay
well mother fucker
nope nope nope nope nope nope nope I
have to learn how to roll I can you have
to you have to upgrade to the roll and
apparently I also need to upgrade to the
the the 180 degree jump and I can't hit
that thing for some reason
this must be the end of the rope they
hit that yep
great
what's over here these things are fun I
know you know I don't I don't it's this
one yeah sure
nice climb fast
see today it's like to me this is kind
of what the game is all about right here
is these these little speedruns I'm
thoroughly enjoying this this kind of
stuff just straight-up parkour
well how am I supposed to get there any
faster one star can I get one star slide
into home jack you miss that you miss a
ship by the race oh did I am no see I
know there we go
do I have enough upgrade points now
no I'm close though now I really want
that 180 degree movement thing hey hey
hey I see you see you parkour and
parkour fuck what fuck fuck fuck fuck a
lot of straight down parkour I know I'm
not the greatest I think this is where I
came from
what are you nothing great oh here we go
steely this movie is best this game is
based off of the movie Gymkhana that's a
true story I heard that about this game
what hey I'm really glad there's not
like a permanent health thing more
things more things lots of stuff to do
that's fun
fuck fuck fuck fuck
I don't know what's up with this thing
why can't I go over there that bothers
me that bothers me very much but that's
okay
a troll hehe roll there's the thing
I like this you know what I like this
game I'm having a good time I feel like
it's it's this is a genre we don't see
very often so I'm gonna go ahead and say
that okay thank you there it is go ahead
and say that I like this this this
certainly makes me feel as if I am
jumping around the city like a crazy
person what what I mean obviously I'm
gonna go do that what play another game
I think that's the thing ox 277 F that's
what we all want we that's that's what
we want our games we want a little
escapism and I am NOT gonna do this kind
of crazy
parkour hey you know what's your deal
did you just come here to crush my
self-esteem or it looks you know the
people don't look through great but I'm
having fun combat is so far a little
repetitive is my only complaint
obviously combat is not a terribly large
part of the game
okay
what fan now what what okay
what
oh that fan
that looks like a pole I can climb
see the game is telling me to turn on a
runner's vision and so I that makes me
think that this game knows that there
are certain parts of the game that are
that's confusing if you need a hint we
can help you out well you know if we
need it oh hello that was just dumb luck
right there that I found that that was
dumb luck but I'll take it
oh I see I should have I wasn't paying
attention to the clues shut off the fan
follow the wires back here I wasn't
paying attention
surprise surprise Jack wasn't paying
attention all right
oh I get it I get it I get it I get it
game I get it I get it
I'm on your wavelength yes I'm so on it
see like this this this is like actual
climbing and shit the the bullshit
climbing that was in uncharted 4 has got
nothing on this on in this stuff you can
actually fail
I'm Jack's total lack of attention I I'm
terrible sometimes I'm just terrible I
mean let's be honest most of the times
I'm just terrible but specifically when
it comes to paying attention sometimes
I'm more terrible than other times game
I do not want to turn my runners vision
on please stop telling me to
you you try the roof how about that
shit
the trouble with uncharted is the jumps
are so impossible sometimes it's tough
to figure out where it wants you to go
luckily there's no shortage of bird crap
well it's not just about that word you
know like there were some parts where
you know we just we couldn't quite
figure out where to go and Uncharted
only because we had to wait for the game
to open the path for us charted is great
a bull hockey oh I landed on the bed
bull hockey
Oh fights uh you know I don't think I
have ADHD but right to do any of it off
to any of us really now I really don't I
really don't think I do
how could I not interact with that
anymore am i stuck now shit oh I guess I
could go back I don't think I have ADHD
I just you know just have a short
attention span
I think that's everybody I think that's
most I think that's in most people
there we go I got it
he called his friends and they showed up
and then in a building down the street
that seems weird let me kick this guy
right off the building or myself right
off the building
get get get out of here I don't know who
screaming and talking at the same time I
was gonna play a bit like they got it
yeah you're right that's and that's the
other thing is I'm talking you guys my
attention is divided
my attention is divided at the moment
wait how do I do this again there we go
okay here we go
I want I want a different button open oh
I'm gonna fall off the edge again fate
wait wait wait back up back up back up
faith you you stingy Biddy is that even
was that real words no probably not all
right how do I get down there without
dying
there's a thing fuck fuck fuck
okay okay okay settle No
yes I think this was a bad idea Oh or
not a hard nut oh oh and how we can get
that knocking at the loved one anything
the dippity-do now we can get the
dippity-do you great so now if I climb
wait no stop
oh right button 180 degree turn
well that's actually incredibly
disorientating yeah that's a lot of like
trusts in the automatic camera right
there that's crazy okay cool all right
great all right how do I get this way ed
this way this way way way nope that's
too far that's too far that's too far I
knew that was too far disorientating
disorienting - sorry
disorienting yes yes nope
okay
how do I get down without dying
important question
oh here we go there it is there's that
that's the thing I was looking for Rolly
Rolly roll up nope that
I'm lost again you know I get lost a lot
in this game just gonna put put that
right out there
motherfucker
huh
sigh lay weep how how do I even
what that who that that means get late
how do i how do I even can I even
I don't the off
this game I mean it's a lot of rooftops
a lot of the rooftops look incredibly
similar and you know it could use a few
things to make it so that I've been lost
I want to say I've been lost in this
exact place several times now I
constantly get lost at the exact same
location and that is very frustrating to
me I just want to know how to get around
also that's a leap I mean can't get that
can I get that nope okay that's not
getting a loss that's the open world
think so X 2 7 7 exactly it
stylistically designed to be that way
you Fox
I just keep ending up it's this choke
point it's it's this building right here
I end up at the exact same choke point
every time somehow I end up exactly
right here this corner right here and I
can't figure out how to get around it so
now I gotta go all the way back here to
this one so I can go over here so you
know it's annoying as shit
and it's annoying as shit there's a wire
can I take that wire cross that probably
goes the other way yeah
Oh steely today turn left at the white
building but I couldn't turn left there
was no left there was no left ok real at
least if there was I did not see a left
like black flight ballot bela Fleck and
the Flecktones is the name of a band
no no that's who's gonna take me right
back to where I was
gosh turn it oh ya think
pretty sure I was just here
across there No
clop Dern it
okay hold on I'm gonna try this whole
left at this building thing cuz this is
where I get befuddled CA there's no left
here maybe you're saying I should go
this way go around this building perhaps
this way
yeah we can go this way he meant the
white building on the left of the other
way filling well yes now we're seeing my
problems will
you need a couple more like zip lining
things that's what we need we
okay I've been here before I know where
this is
ah fuck
oh my god probably not supposed to be in
here
okay here we go now we I feel like we're
getting somewhere maybe
I feel like I'm Way too high up that's
the that's a death right
okay I'm gonna cheese it I want to
cheese it
okay
nice
okay here we go oh hey excuse me
