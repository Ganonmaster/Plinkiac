email whatever email you used to sign up
twitch check your email and see if they
have a little thing that says you're a
moderator now
this is our historic first mission it's
a super time for us we should probably
do a train a few training exercises I
know I'm boring
oh my god so much text welcome to the
space bus tutorial Iser I decided it
myself
neato alright let's tackle the basics
first before we get into the time travel
mind fudge REE oh okay
awesomeness awesomeness all around a to
jump done oh man I'm so good at this
game
X fires yeah the Satori Eliezer is
simulating a blunt bot enemy scratch
that a cheat trigger finger buddy
great
now it's time to test your specially
charged attack on these missile turrets
nice nice that's what that's what
happens when you hold down the fire
button great nailing it
time-travel all right
alright that's super fun wait we can
shoot through walls nice
nice super time force teaching me I can
shoot up and the dag alright
sup she'll be all ready to get this
whole learn stuff thing out of the way
charge attack that totally bounce this
fake nice shield night
what
what what happened
okay well rich if you're in the mod list
in your mind maybe your sword this isn't
showing up God how do I do this what did
he tell me to do again I forgot
I have no idea what I was supposed to do
here
I should have been paying attention
I'm just gonna die over and over here
rich do you wanna stream Mass Effect 3
how do I do this
what the actual fudge I suppose it here
if anyone knows yeah I have been
pressing and charging and holding my
shield and then that happens
I am holding the button down you jerks
he only blocks me from one side Jesus
Christ that's what I'm supposed to view
that's that stuff oh not just to hold it
down hold it down and let it go would
have blocked from both sides see that's
what I was supposed to do I did it wrong
I didn't learn I didn't learn good
enough
all right time thrusters we can learn
all about super timing and forcing
Eddie's soldiers prepare to have your
mind blown what
what if I said I don't know what I'm
supposed to be doing oh here we go
I did it
I think Oh dudes are they're using a
timeout and a team up in other words
you're saying you see man okay it's okay
I see if we can figure out this time
forest mechanic
I was running against the clock we ran
out of time and proved to evaporate into
thin air piss beats it's time out as
many hoes you need to blast down as well
what am i doing
I have no idea what's happening
I don't know if I quite understand this
game yet hey hey rich got his sword
congratulations rich I don't know how to
play the game yet
okay I think I won
oh hey don't spoil invisible ink review
yet and we wants a timeout and tag in a
new team member to add more firepower
could have to get past tough areas like
this one
this is how I was supposed to be doing
like just adding I needs he made it in
whatever oh my god I feel like I'm
really bad at this
okay
you want the actual fuck
I don't know how I feel about this game
so far guys this is taking all of my
concentration
okay you've got 60 seconds to make it
across the battlefield and you've got 30
timeouts when you run out of those well
it's game over
this is not good I'm doing so far why
oh my god
I grabbed a carb
I need more alarms okay
jesus H Christ
there's a lot of thinking for a game
called super time force without there
I'm incredibly beaten by I apologize for
everyone for for my lack of speaking
because it's just there's just so much
there's so much going on and I'm so
terribly confused about everything
about everything and everyone mostly
everything okay oh my god
I don't need this put that out there
right now I don't like this I don't like
the feel this
yeah play checkers I agree like I
actually really kind of dislike this I
was hoping for I was someone for a fun
time shoot him up with with a little
like time mechanic twist and what I'm
getting is too much
hurts my brain
you're gonna press this button
downtime
okay
oh we gotta head
all right so then we gotta go back we
gotta take down the door before the
robot I get it
listen I get it
you kill them so I guess we need another
one that's fine that's fine and I'm
gonna put them right here
ah
Jeff Leppard
now we have Egypt leopard right I'll
just flip ring yet
I can't gets dead right away alright
guys I'm done I'm done I do not like
this game I am not having a good time
playing this game in a stream and I then
maybe maybe under different
circumstances that would be a super fun
game I found it really confusing and not
intuitive at all to play it so I guess
it's time for checkers
