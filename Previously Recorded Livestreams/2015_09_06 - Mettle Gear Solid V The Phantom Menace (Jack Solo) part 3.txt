your things we're catching the show oh
no there's still plenty of cutscenes
don't worry don't ever worry about a
lack of cutscenes in a Metal Gear game
but there's also tapes and it's just you
know snake never does any of the talking
anymore because I can't afford Kiefer
Sutherland for that long
what are you waiting for nothing kill ya
why why am i executing people why not
their enemies
you guys don't kill everyone when you're
playing why not execute them all they're
the enemies they would kill you if they
had the chance that's how I want to play
it as if I was snake and I was
infiltrating an enemy base
I would leave no one alive anyone who
saw me would not be left alive and these
people obviously saw me because you know
I'm interrogating them I don't want
anyone reporting back to their superiors
oh I think he might have been American
he was you know like he was this tall
because he you know they would get a
profile on me no no none of that
come over here already come over here
before your friend does
I'm such a meanie you need them for your
base I've already my base is overloaded
right now with dudes I have so many
dudes that it is it's overflowing its
the manhole up in my--in up in mother
base
yeah you want me to how about this I'll
take this dude this too looks like they
dude here get out of here you're my dude
now dude
ooh there's a diamond over here dudes my
dude there's a diamond over here
somewhere over here
aha diamond thank you
Yonkers radio got nothing all right on
to the mission this dude probably can't
hit him from here
I should have the lights again oh oh
here's a dude who we use a couple dudes
ooh that first dude has got some skills
we want him we want em it's true right
listen to shadow will you guys you want
me to fail if I fail and you guys have
more fun
like this like for example oh my god
how did that not spook this guy okay
this guy we want though he has some
skills we want him get him into the into
the open and open his ass out of here
who and I can also Fulton these things
now I don't know what good that does me
but I guess just just takes their gun
away now this guy this guy is useless
and I'm gonna kill him you know why cuz
he's a useless and really this is the
moral of the story is if you're in any
sort of military any sort of
organization make sure that you're
important enough to be captured and not
killed
this guy's useless he you know what he
goes he goes on the pile of bodies right
on the pile of bodies cuz I don't care
about him helps defend your base oh okay
well then shit I need ammo folding some
more weapons there's a mortar what some
mortars
some humans are useless that's just
that's the sad truth or just the truth
you know if you find it sad
I don't can I take these crates I can't
Fulton the crazy yet and when I get my
next fold an upgrade I'm gonna start
stealing these motherfucking crates
they're everywhere and I just want to
take them how important is this guy
whoo shine bright like a diamond you
might know sandstorm
see this guy kind of worthless but he's
got some engineering skills so we'll
take him first we're gonna get some
Intel out of a cassette tape a cassette
tape that's what you got for me
you're lucky you have that little thing
in engineering where's the cassette tape

cassette tape in there good wait for the
storm to pass pass

here looks like a nice a nice area no
that looks like a mountain II fuck all
area
oh is that what that does what was that
so that was that pinging read all that
there's something pinged read my
favorite fury road character is Furioso
of course she was great she made that
movie you know the character with the
motivation in the drive for the movie
come on horse
okay I do I also like furiosa because
we're both bald and I can empathize with
with baldness okay well here we go here
we go
everybody everybody be cool hey would it
be cool we're here we are here we are
close or in the danger zone now
you don't see shit get out of here
is there a helicopter over here
what the fuck
I think shit is getting real guys I'm
gonna go out on a limb here say that
shit is getting abso-fucking-lutely real
now getting this tall grass over here
are they gonna shoot my horse be real
with me guys are they're gonna shoot my
horse
this is just me sneaking it out in the
tall grass
yeah and back over there fault in the
helicopter right that would be great if
I could do that okay helicopter gone
coming back around sneaking in looking
for dudes
this fucker
when I shoot him right in his fucking
head
you don't see shit
get out of here
I'm taking the path of the most
resistance possibly this is the only
path I have at the moment oh that guy's
got some good stats he's got it well
he's got a D in something at this moment
I will take a D that's how desperate I
am
possibly uh possibly on like two dudes
yeah that's not too bad
take two dudes this guy this guy can go
up there
that fucking helicopter came back there
was a valley to the left that you could
have rode your horse through our top
beat oh well there you go
yes yeah look after just a friendly
helicopter
I'm running out of bushy I'm running out
of Bush is my problem right now I'm not
a bush to hide in what's this guy gonna
do
this is not gonna turn out well
that guy didn't see me now that guy
didn't see me that's fine
come on
and gotcha
what the mission um I don't know what
the mission is who's this specialist was
he the specialist oh that's the
specialist oh this is the specialist
here which is nice
I'm totally gonna grab him
oh don't you dare fucking shoot my horse
oh come on
I was definitely close enough shit then
I put him down put him down put him down
this helicopter doesn't see shit
helicopter does not see shit look at me
I'm hidden I'm way up in the grass
nothing there's just nothing over here I
don't even know why this helicopters
over here
okay which one was a good one again
this one
great
great the helicopter sees the horse no
no that's there or is it's time probably
don't need another I mean I might as
well kill him because I've killed
everybody else right it's just one of
those like do a complete job right dude
okay off we go
to do to do
get out of here before the helicopter
comes back
che fucking outpost
Oh
helicopters really close okay oh then I
just kill the specialist I might have
whatever
like I would say we got enough dudes
crap
there we go
okay hi hi how deep are we into the game
I kind of deep we're a few hours we're a
few hours into the game
you know nothing before the last couple
missions I think I was at like five
percent complete completion of the game
so none we were no we're now we're
terribly far into the game but we're far
enough jack dude you shot him in the
neck I know I know my you know what the
the sniper rifle the site I'm not used
to the I'm not used to like the top of
the triangle site I'm more used to kind
of spot sites or iron tights and so it
just takes a little gets easy two hours
is five percent of oh I have no idea I
mean I have no idea how long the game is
how deep I'm into it and you know like a
couple hours for me I'm a really slow
gamer I've been doing the side missions
I kind of notoriously take a long time
to play games
yeah glad I went up here you know I got
the diamond shine bright like a diamond
it is getting to be daylight now though
and I don't like that so actually what I
think I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna do
bit up we're just gonna hang out up here
we're gonna hang out up here on this
crevasse and smoke a doob where's my
dude all right light it up am I still
playing blood-borne know I beat Bell
born I I've discovered afterwards that I
did I beat it in kind of the the non
good ending way it might at the ending
that I beat blood-borne in was the
accept death ending which you know kind
of is how I wanted to end it but alright
I do get up so now it's nighttime again
oh now there's a guy up there
well
shit this guy this guy's probably gonna
see me I jumped the gun here
I totally jumped the gun well I'm kind
of in the grass he might not see me he
might not see you let's hope he doesn't
see me I jumped the D
shit
it's fine
Oh blueprints
okay and now we're gonna take your body
and hide it up here cuz that seems like
a good place there nobody look up there
now this guy I think is gonna be a
little harder to sneak around realistic
next-gen and I write you know some of it
has to be forgiven it's it's very funny
in a game because of course the game
knows where you are and the game has to
tell the other part of the game that
knows where you are
that it can't see you so we're not gonna
blame it too hard and that's gotta be
tough that's gotta be tough when I think
AI is bad in a game do you think it's
because programmers are lazy or that
designers think their audience is stupid
um a little bit of neither a little bit
of both if that is a fair answer I think
that when people program a game they
become really into the game and
and I think when you write a game and
you play a game you're playing it as the
person who wrote it and so being
objective about like what is fair and
what it's balance has got to be
incredibly hard which is why play
testing is so important but I think it's
it's just not being able to account for
every single different person playing a
game because you can't you can't account
for every the way everybody's going to
handle a situation
that's getting a little annoying I think
I can turn the idroid off but sometimes
it tells me useful information so in
general I like it on but it's getting a
legal annoying analysis completed
there's another one oh that guy's got
some good stats oh and I can turn night
vision on I don't think that'll really
help me here yeah that's a little line
but it's over now okay nope one more
okay oh my god
just more dudes more dudes so this is a
fun area so we have to get to this guy
and balloon him out this is gonna be
interesting
this is gonna be interesting right here
no I did not play Ground zeroes so I
don't know I think that was like the
prequel to this right because in this
game you wake up having been in a coma
for a while and so I think in ground
zeroes is the thing that puts you in a
coma
I do not know though because I did not
play it black Karen
fucking helicopter
wait he said helicopter coming here no
okay something
okay okay so what is happening over here
just too much shit I wanna I want to be
able to climb up over here but I know I
can't there's just so much shit I want
to start taking out guys but they're
just everywhere I'm gonna try to sneak
my way over this way sneak sneak
snake shit that's one guy coming closer
and gotta hide a little bit
okay I'm being sneaky I'm trying to be
sneaky I don't think it's necessarily
working well it's working for now those
guys are going that way that's great
by a big light but that's fine that's
fine
oh shut up am I gonna get super lucky
here oh yeah you can steal posters oh my
god I'm gonna get super lucky
everybody's eyesight is fuck during the
sandstorm but it could end at any moment
analysis complete
shit shit shit
someone think they saw me can I go where
can I go where can I go kind of boned
cuz I don't really know where I'm going
okay here we go it's fine it's fine it's
fine nobody saw me
nobody's over here this guy that we can
take care of this guy
I can't fucking sleeping
when I lure him over here but
I got this fuck just stand-in there
here we go there we go
now when he goes back I might be able to
grab them turn around
alright here we go
everything's fine
now we can go back to crawling I got a
clear shot I got a clear shot
maybe fucks
sorry it gets really it gets really
quiet and when I start concentrating
this guy nope nope nobody heard you
nobody heard you shhh
nobody heard you nobody heard you come
over here you're gonna die you need to
be okay with time come over here
there you go
hey go everything's gonna be fine
everything's gonna be fine when you're
dead
shit shit shit what are you doing what
are you doing why are you coming over
here fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck I'm
cutting the cord I'm cutting the cord
I've gotta go I can't believe I gotta go
away from that guy oh yeah I'm not gonna
hurt you I'm not gonna hurt you just let
it happen just let it happen okay here
we go here we go here we go
no he's not going to check the lights
look he's looking at that poster these
posters you can collect those these
posters right here for for money come on
move already do it I can lure him
no I'm gonna kill you oh wait no he
can't discover the dead body there we go
I remembered to use a tranquilizer just
let it happen here this is a much better
place to store my dead bodies
you two come over you come way over here
okay great
everything's fine okay
so now we should be able to maneuver a
little bit better crawl over here
everything's fine everything's fine
over here everything's fine you can't
tell what's happening crawling oh my god
it's midnight okay Jack I'm sorry I like
this game don't hate it or think less of
no you know what's so like come axion so
far I feel very fine about the game
everything about this game is fine I
have no strong positive or negative
feelings and more so if you really like
it that's all that matters it doesn't
other people's opinions does not matter
but you know so far I think it's fine
I'd like a little more crazy in fact I
was expecting a lot more crazy with this
game oh ok apparently we're standing now
I did not press the stand button where's
everybody I'm sure there's some people
around here where is my dude where did
they take my dude
removing him
shit dad takes you long that it takes me
long to get my dude Summa bitch
this feels like a creepy thing it feels
like some creepy stuff is gonna happen
now we got some weird are they going
I either took too long or this is it
this is a scripted thing here and I
think this is a scripted thing here oh
my god that guy didn't see me can you
believe that that guy didn't see me
that was lucky that was incredibly
incredibly lucky that that guy did not
see me I can't even believe how lucky I
am that was bullshit that guy really
should have seen me wait there was a
diamond T or something that was utterly
utterly bullshit that that guy did not
see me
I want to steal their stuff I'm just too
good no I don't believe that at all I
believe that that was a broken part of
the game but that's fine we're gonna be
fine with that shit gotta hide you
before your friend comes back oh and
your friend is coming back you ever go
over here in the bush
shit
yeah okay hey go down there that's fine
yeah that's fine
okay here we go Oh another diamond
that's gonna be helpful shine bright
like a diamond shine bright like Rihanna
all right here we go dudes all over the
place just like I like it I mostly don't
know where I'm going but I figured you
guys know that already like I just came
from there whoo diamond
diamond Oh lots of diamonds
okay okay okay I think I need to stand
up in a little bit again what is that
guy doing there guys just standing there
there's diamonds though I gotta go get
those diamonds I know there's guys
everywhere but it's like my bass fuckin
runs on diamonds were the fucking
Diamond Dogs you know you know we're the
Diamond Dogs your back is gonna hurt
after this vision my back hurts now I've
been leaning forward okay where is that
guy he freaks me out it freaks me out
that I don't know where that guy is what
the fuck right here we go breathe air
room
yeah I know
oh there's a guy there's a guy
what
the prisoner has died is that does that
mean it fucked up
Oh
I think I think that I slightly fail I
might have slightly failed
shit-shit heard me he heard me okay it's
one of these guys these guys have the
honeybee
really really this is what's happening
there we are
okay I'm okay I got the honeybee I got
the honeybee that's all I matters oh
fuck so mission not a total failure oh
my god the honeybee is a rocket launcher
that's awesome you are not to use the
rocket launcher well I mean come on
what's over here this looks like a
secret e area you are not to use the
honeybee get out of town
you're not to use the honeybee right
where's the mixtape where's my mixtape I
got to get out of here
wait what was that there's a thing I saw
over here Shh it's like a maze I gotta
get out of here
nope
it is creepiest fun yeah what is that
what does that mean
she's a gun that's fine whatever you
know what it's fine okay we got to get
out of here
I got my pistol I'm gonna try going down
this jack is getting yeah I'm getting
it's you know what it's getting a little
creepy in here but I think it's supposed
to be alright try going down this and
exit yeah I feel like something spooky
is gonna happen is that a thing
do spookiness happen because that's what
it feels like right now is like I'm
going to spookiness
he told me not to use the honeybee I'm
not gonna use the honeybee
this feels exactly like where the ghosts
attacked
a ghost bear the the ghost of the bear
that I captured is gonna attack that you
know that would be something Oh yep
there it is
okay okay I am now in ghost
I'm now in cutscene
okay
oh it's that girl
it's Psycho Mantis
Oh what what that's a boy
that's a girl it looks like a girl that
was very spooky
that was very spooky and now we are in
the grips of a thing
oh is that little psycho mantis whatever
you look well-rested big balls
how you became a demon
well I'm sure you'll see the bigger
picture what
rest in peace this time
why so who is that and why is he wearing
a lone ranger mask these are the
questions
what
of those things again we've seen those
things before I don't necessarily know
how to fight him
you're right I did ask for crazy well
shit
running now running now
No
get up
okay get up snake
okay all right
it took me a while to you so you have to
UM get to the Java I know so you have to
kind of lock on to them using the r1 oh
no
I don't know it just happened goddamnit
what I liked the original Metal Gear
salad call your horse and get the hell
out of there yeah that's not very
satisfying just to run away but I its
how switching weapons is difficult I
feel like switching weapons is difficult
but let's know
nope
okay
yeah shit shit shit how do I get out of
here okay come on jump jump move your
horse move run away
run
I don't much care for that was I
supposed to run away or was I supposed
to fight them this is the question was I
supposed to run her was I supposed to
fight because running worked running was
very effective obviously but I feel like
running was not very satisfying
poop game is poopy you know you were
supposed to run or fight right because
fighting didn't seem to work you didn't
seem to do anything it's this is wildly
unclear and very frustrating to watch
it's a little frustrating to play I'm
shooting down the chopper where's it oh
fuck
you're going the wrong way mr. Schine
all you ever think about that you're
going the wrong way you know I made the
skulls yeah you killed the shit out of
them congratulations I'm great I'm glad
that you did I couldn't get my weapon
switch fast enough and I couldn't shoot
them in time I don't know
I don't know
brain
I ran to thank schematics see ya know I
just don't know if I quite understand
what's happening again don't know if I
quite get it
or if I'm supposed to
you know
I suppose in twitchplayspokemon I just
you know like I'm not proficient in
weapon switching yet and I felt like I
needed to switch really fast and it's
very it's very clunky and I'm just not I
don't know it's stuff like that where
I'm not quite feeling it where you know
I've spent the first 10 hours just
fighting the same base again over and
over again right
and then all of a sudden it's like ah
scary dudes you know and a rocket
launcher you so yeah I suck again which
is fine I don't know did not much care
for that I mean the sneaking in was fun
obviously but I know you tap the d-pad
for for quick switching but then you
have to tap that you have to hold the
d-pad and then press which weapon you
want and it didn't seem to I didn't I
didn't seem to get it is I guess what
I'm saying yeah I'm gonna go play with
my puppy that's pretty much what's gonna
happen
on these stupid credits is Jack drunk a
little bit probably
the game was the game you know there was
a lot of people yelling at me there was
a lot of chaos which I'm sure was part
of the theming
we're getting some Kiefer Sutherland
dialogue
oh that's it ten ten lines of dialogue
so far
another yeah pretty much you know I just
don't I just don't quite I'm not I'm not
quite sold yet the game you know I you
know I I don't what's basically
happening here is me trying very hard to
keep playing the game you know this is
not a game that I would normally pick up
you know being so story focused but but
here I am and I'm trying to give it a
fair shake oh there's my papi
Oh puppy Oh
Puppis do make everything better
alright go raise some morale over here
hi dude
great yeah morels raised all right go
take a quick shower shower it up yes I
will you know what I will experiment
with tapping the d-pad you can't really
have weapons in here so it doesn't it
doesn't really help
all right here's dude sure I go
yeah I don't know it's it's it feels a
little here's a little clunky box I walk
around my box for a little bit don't
mind me I'm in a box what Jeep don't
mind me I'm in a box depressants are
kicking it yeah it's yeah I
so far the that's right
you listen you don't tell me what the
fuck to do that's rule number one there
you know I feel like this is a series
that has now become so self-contained
that they don't care about new people
anymore and I think if you're a fan of
metal gear you're gonna like this and if
you're not a fan of metal here you're
not gonna like this that's no no no
mother base wait did I say hi to this
dude yet shut your hole 39 minutes
dickhead
alright alright so yeah I you know I
think if if you've liked all the other
Metal Gear games this you'll like this
and and if you're like me who's never
really got into and past the first one
oh look at that it's building our new
convinced center so that's not ever game
though like there I think there are some
games that handle inclusion better I
think I think you can handle you know
what's what's Stan Lee's comic book role
you know imagine that any comic is
someone's first comic any comic book can
be someone's first comic but anyway it
doesn't matter this is it for today I'm
still giving it a good clean shake I'm
gonna try to keep playing keep giving it
a clean shake but just no more tonight
because I'm getting tired so let's see
if we have any new subscribers we have
