I can buy some emergency food
here is your token right
well done forgive me
again a token is at stake
you know I approached you to paid some
attention
yeah food is crucial for healing
if you travel without food your strength
will not be restored between encounters
you'll also begin to starve it seems
you'll learn that soon enough though
this plague and pestilence and blocks
the bigger penalty for not having food
that I remembered there was only five
yes I am sorry I cannot read tips
tonight Friday I believe they should all
be saved Friday I'll just do a massive
tip reading we're gonna make upstream
well not really make up because I am
streaming tonight but we're doing a
stream on Friday and it will probably be
Phoenix right
you son-of-a-bitch
I hate the Jaco rats
it's an irritating fight not a fun one
the queens and kings of the rat kind
have lost the child here today for
slaughter your reward
all these fucking tokens
new maiden that's interesting
come play I do not want to just sit here
now we play you can now access endless
mode if you wish to test your skills
against chance itself so where do you
think I'm gonna die once
when's my death gonna happen some men
thrive in anarchy and chaos the king of
dust is one such his tools are cruelty
and terror and I suspect he will Harbor
a great Patriot
I need an extra I don't need any of this
shit hey Sadie Nate
yeah
and about five to six years for you rich
huh I get it
you fuckers can be so cruel so
unimaginably cruel
Oh
treasures always good
I need money loan isn't bad
in these lands the king of dust takes
his tithe
don't worry rich you'll always live
forever in my memories no I will not
because you will not live forever and
neither will your memories it's the
second we're all gonna die my kings I
can't live forever then no one can
that's what I say that forces with the
strength of their will they will turn
that power to your destruction all right
what is the curse for this go around
here what do you do okay gold will be a
problem oh you can't a good day to be in
steagle
ooh yes yes double yes I need fifty
spare coins for the Rat Man event which
is why I'm gonna do this to waste some
more food
very nice indeed
ooh the new maiden let us take a token
on their foolishness
the token is yours her let us see what
you do with your newfound abilities a
horse is a fine companion
I'm sure you'll leave this one in time
you do not seem to have the temperament
for friends the Rat Man event there's a
baron who if you give him $50
he will eliminate the rat man he will
call their numbers and that gets the
unlocks the rat men cards he could take
them out of your deck they're useless
cards that waste waste card slots with
just stupid rat men encounters that get
you nothing I want to get rid of them so
I need $50 to pay a baron do you
comprehend the stakes
I will happily wager on the outcome I do
not think you have what it takes
yeah
Hey
don't pretty good doing pretty good
rich have you ever been involved in a
road rage incident I ran an 80 year old
woman off the road once bitch deserved
it
your provisions are running low can you
press on
these places are rife with power it is
not chance that you should meet a wall
up here
Oh a trap I hid a trap
all right I still have enough to pay the
Baron and I'm getting food which is very
good I'm sure you a grateful for that I
better run across the Baron if I don't
I'll be upset
what brings you to play the game I know
you will not tell me like all the rest
you are silent
my bandits are solely loyal to their
king they will not let you reach him
easily
right
I'm actually talking you just can't hear
me that's true look this enriched having
solo stream and when I play a game where
I need to concentrate I'm almost gonna
be saying nothing maybe this game was a
mistake I don't know but I'm here I care
about you guys enough that I'm here like
they were looking forward to a stream
but I want to cancel the last minute I'm
doing a stream denied and you can't stop
me Jack he didn't try to stop me from
streaming then he thought wasn't gonna
do but just forgotten just for dramatic
purposes you can't stop me from
screaming straining screaming either
really I could scream if I wanted to I'm
not going to because I've been probably
injured most of your eardrums I know how
my voice works
I'm impressed
if you select these sorts of weapons
because nobody ever anticipates being in
peril
such misplaced confidence is usually
their downfall 10 food yes this time I
don't think I had to do anything too
well this wasn't so an average Nelson
counter
damnit
damnit
damnit
you may have to contend with every
bandit in the kingdom before you read I
didn't have the iron price I would have
paid the iron price but it didn't hit
I better get something good for that
card so now I don't have enough money to
afford getting rid of the Rat Man if I'm
at my ten even run across that guy so I
guess it's alright CEO Knox just the
rattmann are and why I want to get rid
of them get away from me
wait some cheese
whether I like it sell equipment really
is that what you're going to do I can't
solve that
will I be streaming for 12 hours no
actually I'm probably not gonna go that
late tonight cuz I've got a huge day
ahead of me tomorrow I'm gonna be from
busy from morning till night
so probably done when I die in this
are there any ill effects from selling
this shit
but on the next combat encounter
all right bare minimum
I've got the bare metal
an expedition press on did you expect me
to tell your fortune no a fortune teller
is at their most base and despicable
when they begin to believe their own
lies
now of course I am different this was
the hardest there's a token in it for
you if you win
yes
all right everybody in the chat all
right everybody
please pay attention all right please
pay attention
oh my god it was on top both times it
was on top both times I I just by
amazing luck I got a very hard token to
get because the important card appeared
on the top of the deck both shuffles and
I was able to easily track it many of
these blessings are too good for the
likes of you
yeah take it
Wow I'm sorry about yours I actually
believe it or not I moved the mic away
from my face I actually I moved the mic
over here I'm not sure how well you're
hearing me now but that's how far the
mic was away and I looked up so I
apologize I thought that would be enough
to lessen the impact of the whoo it was
it was not and I am sorry I was happy
about that though our bandits are
displeased with your challenges
golde golde now come on baron all right
I don't know what happens here win this
and claim my token minding my own
business at a local tavern when suddenly
three masked men burst through the doors
grab a young a young man from the bar
and manhandle him outside one page and
burst out in protest but is quickly
silenced but some stairs of all those
around him they even be garrote it is
time that must be done I follow the
master Tigers outside yeah sure why not
Oh God fire rats
and I no longer have enough money for
the Baron I won't but I got the token
for this
now you have reached a point from which
the path ahead is unclear what will be
your solution
what's everybody thinking what is
everybody thinking
two or three oh three yes Thank You Chad
thank you yes you guys earned that token
Goomer scenario contract at downwards if
you dare
at their heart all games are about power
are they not the acquiring of power the
retaining of power and most importantly
the use of power a challenge for you and
a token if you succeed
easy
yes yes fine fine I'm sure you're
grateful for that
we play for a token now
see what just happened there was that
that encounter with the devil it started
me off with low health and the weapon
I'm using gets stronger to lower your
health is plus undead our week two maces
and it's a mace so it just devastated
them
yeah again the surprise attack the
novelty must wear thin on subsequent
travels six bandits to keep you on your
toes
nice
what am i fighting what do you do
there's no strength like I've got medium
armor I think no I sold the medium armor
what's your deal fire in its
multitudinous forms we still hold it in
esteem and Wonder
we'll go offense
one food work your way through the woods
and see what lies beyond yes our lives
are often lived that's are they not
pushed back and forth by the whims of
nobility or power
rats have so few friends amongst mankind
yet the two have lived in close
proximity throughout the ages and are
more similar than either would care to
admit actually you know what I know one
of these two is gonna be a Rat Man
encounter so I'm just gonna equip that
shit anyway for now but honestly these
are what unlock more tokens every game
must include an element of surprise
wouldn't you say sometimes it is the
human on the other side of the table
sometimes the drawer of a card or the
roll of the dice without it the game is
nothing but a computing machine
kick their ass
yes James for Amma as you will yeah so
we're gonna be anything I want here
probably not
but doesn't hurt a check right all right
we got what do we got heal wounds remove
curses yeah
fuck it
where is Luke remember he can only ask
why that was so different
roaming ever forward hunting for the
truth on this floor the king of dust
waits for you he is prepared are you
knew I was gonna start running into the
rat men our old friend the Jack of
plague returns to fight another day
when a rich will change his mind about
the review now that he's got the master
hand of fate I don't think I hated it to
begin with though I like to hand to fame
oops wrong button
charity ah the wandering mendicant will
humanity ever move beyond poverty
religion and charity
yeah I got playing
the gods look upon you favourably so
much good shit this run and then
proceeds relentlessly with each step you
will discover a new card and a deeper
mystery we meet the jack again did you
think him done before Oh shuffle back
into the deck to rise again to the top
as are we know King falls without a
challenge
I'm surprised to see you turning your
back on gold alright that's a pretty
good runner
a choice select your desire
oh god I've got so much shit it's
ridiculous
all right and I expect to run across the
king soon and what do you do you damage
Weiss yeah
desperate measures measures slightly
better for that the the cleaver is good
against rats and does extra damage but I
switched in time but it's shame I
couldn't explore everything oh well I've
done okay
come on
oh she did already
not quite
dodge my dad you fucker
are you dead yet keep getting aggressive
miss I keep thinking he's near death and
one hits gonna do it and it never does
there are many who will be pleased that
you have defeated the likes of my lesser
game that's for me I don't take a
bathroom break you have but let me look
at my booty first I mean the spoils of
war have my ass
you're not gonna grab me or look at my
ass and beard decay people take like a
mirror look at their own ass and admire
it does that ever happen
lesbians ever look at their own boobs I
would
rich do I believe in the healing power
of therapeutic crystals no I can only
assume that's a joke asking me that
did I not see chasing amy i saw it but i
saw that like in the theaters when it
first came out i don't i don't remember
much about chasing amy the mall I wonder
all right now I'm thinking about it
right
take your time if you like I've waited
long enough
right
okay you know because I have an early
and long day tomorrow I think I'm gonna
call it quits after this round here but
it should be a longer one the suit of
scales are represented by these lizard
men I going back to like Windows 10 and
now what not I noticed something
interesting earlier today cuz I have
incarnated assumed I was looking at the
system requirements for the new doom II
laughter after everything that like you
know what I'm gonna go back even further
to quantum break right quantum break
which ran like garbage on my system I
met all of the recommended specs
except for RAM which I was still at the
minimum for I wasn't over in the limit I
was an overpowered with Ram as far as
quantum break was concerned but it was
at the limit and that fucker ranted two
frames per second so I'm like what what
are the requirements for Doom I better
I'm gonna find out just just in case I
do wants me to have 16 gigabytes of RAM
and I looked
turns out I meet dooms like ultra specs
across the board but operating system
for the new doom it specifically says in
the new dooms requirements windows 7
it doesn't say windows 10 it says
windows 7 and I find that greatly
amusing
which since all third person shooters
are bad did you ever play max payne 3 I
haven't played max payne 3 but yes it's
exactly what I said
said all third-person shooters are bad
in fact all third person games are bad
this game right now I hate it because
it's the third person
no I don't want the recommended deck I
want my own deck
that's not bad
you do again
that's not terrible either
your stupid pants let's get rid of ones
I've done
hmm what do I want
I know mr. Lionel ends up big bad after
a while he starts taking things from you
so I don't want him I think that comes
with treasurer think that goes a
treasurer right
but I can't like a doom for just do I'm
calling it doom is you know what I'm
talking about you have taken one of my
symbols suppose I should call a doom for
my scepter
scales ah this layout again listen fuck
Arvixe have been raised there is no
weapon I will not use against you
dry the skull keep your eye on the skull
skulls on top don't want that frost Fang
all right
I like frost fit a chance to discover
what your heart probably nothing I can
afford
ah let us see how you progress with that
millstone around your neck of course you
can remove your curses at shops if you
can find them still I'm keen to see how
you handle your disadvantages
again a token is at stake
how's it easy token
what do you do
what do you think I've already got a
decent weapon frost Fang
ah freezing enemies in place could be
good another token brings you closer to
your goals oh that's true ice is
effective against lizards and I am
fighting the lizard men I gotta fight
the jack of lizards so yeah yeah
or people leaving the C Civil War I
don't blame you it's fine I'm not gonna
be streaming too much longer this is the
last section of the game I'm playing
through I'm getting to them I mean
they're getting to the jack of scales or
I'm dying and then I'm done either way
easy easy
it doesn't hasn't heard that I got a
decent weapon early max hold food always
good always good I appreciate especially
with that wasteful fucking starting
layout that was crap it is a pleasure to
see you play a ship at dock is worth
nothing until it sails
as you plunder the secrets of your
memories you'll gain new cards some you
wish is left untouched
I've got decent amount of health
chat offer blood or refuse
I want the token I don't care how
dangerous it is
do I bleed yeah well who well easy come
easy go oh damn that hurt that's the
best blessing in the game though well
and health a recipe for a happy life
I doubt things will end that way mind
you
let us take a token on their foolishness
you know what I'll be fine everything's
gonna be just fine we're good
shet you're talking about doom 64 I I
know a lot of people like doom 64 but oh
god I can't stand the the new sprites I
just don't think they look as good and
then technically sure higher resolution
but just I love the design and the
classic doom sprites so much
Oh die
let's knew I never seen one of you guys
do an unblockable attack before
it's better than trudging along a muddy
road certainly
what brings you to play the game I know
you will not tell me like all the rest
you are silent
every game I have what do you want that
I don't have and losers without them it
degenerates into nothingness
I made that a little too powerful I will
have to rebalance that next time hmm I
have an accent a very good song
see what I can sell made food probably
nothing
fuck my nutsack
I have to do
because our foe under the circumstances
I got to take stairs did you expect me
to tell your fortune no a fortune teller
is at their most base and despicable
when they begin to believe their own
lies
I am different
my powers are genuine
sure sure why not
very nice indeed
choose from these options
food give me food food food damn it
I'm sure you agree fool for that no I'm
not
supplies yes rely victory from the jaws
of defeat with that shit is I will
happily wager on the outcome I do not
think you have what it takes
I'll have a lot of text for this one in
there geez
these hoes alright another free token
what do you got what do you got
armored that gives you the proportional
strength and power of a barbarian which
you are on closer examination
can I lose that's the question out can
Richelieu's know the answer is no I
cannot I'm sure I have now ultra win for
all timing to have the temperament for
friends even in the animal kingdom
when I dreamed long ago my dreams were a
flight
I figured what the right move is here
I'll be free
yeah kind of Rumson for me
so often this is how the story ends is
it not the hero tries the hero dies
their memory is celebrated but they are
lost
are you sure that's the right approach
I appreciate your ingenuity I look
forward to seeing how you approach this
particular challenge
haha the count enters the picture
oh my - I'm too blessed for this to work
apparently that's what I'm assuming
normally you'd you let him suck some of
your blood and you get a thing so what
should I do attack or flee
I guess attack right how do those people
leaving with chat and leaving the stream
have a nice night I'm going for attack
but I don't get the token is what it is
oh yeah
it's not enough that you kill them
you'll cuss them too
gloves are good that's why I took them
look look deeply this is the fate of
heroes
many of these blessings are too good for
the likes of you so many blessings it's
a miracle
if you if you tipped it should be saved
we're streaming on Friday I will browse
read them all on Friday Street this is
kind of somewhat of an impromptu thing
here I don't have Jack's laptop which
has all the other than the tip software
on it and I don't have my Windows seven
Drive I got the windows seven one eye
ten one that I had to install for
chronobreak yada yada but I don't have
the tip software on my PC so uh Jack
could make it tonight and I don't have
any way to read tips Friday Friday that
will happen Friday Friday will probably
be probably be Phoenix right on Jack's
3ds it's enough to put you off crossing
at bridges like this surely there's an
alternative that would leave you less
exposed and vulnerable
did we hate this game I don't recall
ever hating this game I like hand of
fate
Wow that cold glass is really freakin
finicky now I don't remember being that
hard to freeze people before
I'm sure you agree fool oh the map
that's a really important card right out
I always forget what do you do being
tougher than you look is a very
considerable advantage every dying man
would trade wealth for health
the ring the ring the problem with the
ring here's here's what the ring does
the ring when this ring is sold all of
the players gold is lost but the player
receives +1 max health for every 5 gold
lost as a result of the sale so I only
get one extra health for every 5 coins I
only have 2 coins right now I don't want
to bet on gaining a bunch of gold that I
probably won't gain meanwhile the armor
I'm wearing the Berserker armor I think
that counts as light this will knock it
up to medium I'm ill with a helmet
I know next I'll get a ton of gold but
shit happens
shit happens were you hoping this was
the end no another floor of waits and
I've run into so many shops there might
not even be many more shops ahead of me
as fine Lizard Men are nothing if not
patient he waits for you
take it so I got next to nothing for
that all right
this token will unlock more cards if you
can defeat this encounter
I gotta figure out this guild masters
ring thing exact card to show up there's
a token in it for you if you win
colonel rich mustard the things that
watch time and time again usually our
movies over watch TV shows over it over
an adventure brothers always happen for
a venture brothers on my pcs playlist
now I've not seen the new season yet I
don't have basic cable I'm waiting for
it to come out in DVD are you afraid of
the grave what irony C sharp I could
have sold that ring but I got no gold so
I made the right choice ha
oh it's an Adult Swim's website well I
might I might catch up out of them are
they all there
what sort of scoundrel would go through
a sleeping man's belongings oh I need
cable to log in to watch it okay yes
that's not happening win this and claim
my token
Oh 30% of my gold oh no that's bad
though
one more piece of the puzzle for you
alright just in time I'm Netflix but I
don't like Netflix has the current
season of Venture Brothers
does venture brothers I mean does
netflix have season 6 of The Venture
Brothers
oh this is too easy
ice weaknesses for the win
easy
hmm well played well played indeed you
have defeated something that I never
expected to die
guy looks look at all my unlocks the
wand represents my will in the purest
sense it is not too late for you to give
up now go peacefully to your fate and
you begin to assemble a credible deck
let us see what happens next
rich say some stuff that Jack would say
it's true we really do
not a bad little run
my soft way done all right let's see if
I can figure out whose sub tonight
favorite color blue or possibly red
you know what I'm getting an error here
for my thing above our
Oh somebody else already did it all
right showing some kind of ad I don't
see the actual list oh not a robot thing
here

Friday that's that's the current plan I

believe for both me and Jack the only
thing I know about Phoenix right is he
says objection

there will probably not be a stream on
Sunday because Mother's Day so there's
that but I will see everybody on Friday
