returned to a low for bard here against
our will by a great cataclysm from the
reaches of space
I'll be the air cave casting a dark
shadow of debris over land within the
violence of its it back through though
we perceived this for beyond space time
it was but a curiosity a brief flare in
the infinite March of the universe but
the meteor brought with it corruption
the great poison burst forth visible and
clawing out life was such violence that
we were ripped from our peaceful state
and follow the shadows of a portal for
vilified searching for why we are here

at the studio is region free ie plays
all regions but it might not so like I
don't know this is the real truth about
me and the amount of my knowing it's not
it's not several platforms in the other
room oh oh oh I see
platforms are moving
are they not moving anymore did I run
out of juice anymore juice
I can give you juice absol
I took too long the platform's forgot
how to move
I can only assume uh cherry dare do it
did it I don't know
I think I didn't do it I want to say
that I need to hit this button and make
it up to the other one in time all right
here we go driving it
here we go here we go run run run run
jump and jump and jump great it helps if
I say what I do just helps me
this guy goes more platforms get raised
oh I don't hear the buzzer anymore so I
don't think I'm under the time
constraint anymore but I could be been
in that door before I have I think
that's the door I came in okay all right
great
we did it anything is possible guys
anything is possible
you know like there's like a hidden
thing here
I have to remember how this work so it's
like here then another one and then no
one up here here another one I want up
here
I don't think there's anything up there
it's a way to double jump with these
guys and I forget how it goes
yay energy tank
what Oxford J I just I just glanced back
at the chat and I for J says I used to
have a pair of 8-inch platform boots for
some reason oxygen a what how how could
how is that comfortable
we're not even talk about how to looked
sure it looked ridiculous but how is
that comfortable
I could even get along and get around in
that oh thank you leftover beefcake
shucks test Chuck's tests thank you for
subscribing I really appreciate it thank
you very much
whoo there was a thing in there I just
don't play yeah okay what do I need to
do now time is it it's almost 11:00 guys
probably gonna ramp this up in a like a
half an hour just wanna let you know
that solid three hours
I was dreaming Metroid Prime I hope
everyone realizes what an amazing game
this is because it is enough said
let's go
and I want to say that a lot of my
Planes Trains employ heads what are you
talking about put the thing in the thing
of course I want to say that a lot of my
praises you know like whatever video
game talk would come up and we always
talked you know he eventually the topic
of a video game that got it right would
uh would come up I would always point to
Metroid Prime and I think dicks I think
I think that I'm right I think that I
was correct in my assessment that indeed
oh shit that was a dumb idea that indeed
Metroid Prime got it right for a lot for
a lot of this a lot of this is really is
really fluid and you know we have a
couple cutscene not not even cutscenes
like a couple a couple moments that kind
of take you out of of Samus about the
very short and
and so far there have been no real
cutscenes you know where Samus is
talking to someone and you're really
just not playing anything all story is
is all internal here which is great you
just cover things at your own pace the
story is optional I think that's an
important I think that's an important
point it's like discovering the story is
optional it's a little this is a little
more linear than I remember it being you
know like there's definitely a proper
order to do things not saying that's
necessarily a good or bad thing it's
just yet as compared with Super Metroid
everyone remember Super Metroid it's a
lot more linear which is fine which is
fine they're different games different
games for different times can this be
open with this one
why are you ignoring olive oil because I
haven't seen boyhood I've noticed that
every months mentioning boy I did but I
have not seen boyhood great
so I cannot unfortunately I can't join
in on your boyhood miss because I have
not seen the greatest movie made in our
generation Harlem were friends yes I
know where my children are Metroid Prime
does it's it's this is a really fun game
I wish in a perfect world we could get
Metroid Prime on a PC like we we could
get this with a little bit better
controls the controls are little their
little jank in a perfect world this
could be on PC it is still active great
I don't remember if we if the wii
controls were any good I can't imagine I
just can't imagine they were that much
greater but I'm already like I'm you
know just a couple hours in them
definitely
the controls are best done we know you
know I it could be I just I don't
remember pointing the Wiimote at the TV
for long stretches I believe it oh
that's right okay though that thing okay
I think that would be a hard part is
pointing the Wii mode at the screen for
long stretches but listen it's this is
nice this is a nice and I'm definitely
like I've grown acclimated to the weird
controls a lot faster than I thought I
would I really thought that this was
going to be a a rougher we a rougher
game than it has been so
you know you definitely get used to the
locked-down aiming and the only strafe
only strafe when you get out I know I
know shit shit shit
everything's fine anything sighs tell me
about it everything's fine everything's
fine can we bring back HR jokes
the very next comment is boyhood three
two three four four two three oh man
these men will be these men will be
hailed as Oscar winners how about that
new iPad head back that jingle head back
this way looks like we're coming to a
thing there's a thing I see a thing
gonna do a thing you know what whoa whoa
let's thing it up whoa whoa dang it up
nope
I bet samus does that all the time is
what well I think we've discussed
whether or not a shower is really that
bad and I think the general consensus is
it can't be it can't be as bad as we're
all imagining because it was such a
notorious flop
why do we have to do here oh that's
right that's right oh my god of course
this is the whole thing I've been
waiting for this
well you're right and frog in front of
me so Ron I think I got to earlier so I
think I need one more runic symbol fuck
you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck all
of you fuck you
yeah for you to be aiive
great great you gotta find that last
runic symbol tell you
shit fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck fuck fuck did I mention that this
could use some better controls fuck fuck
fuck fuck fuck fuck
god fucking fuck fuck dammit fuck damn
fuck damn fuck okay I've already
activated that runic the symbol great ah
damn it
could use some better controls at the
time when this was all we had
oh man I say that as if we did also
didn't have amazing PC first-person
shooters at the time but in any case in
any case
yeah I think I see you guys talking
about like J and Mike's opinion on
boyhood yeah they never like they never
bash it they just said it was kind of
boring which Richard Linklater also said
I don't think it's any I don't think
it's any surprise that it's kind of a
bland film it is what it is and am I
looking for here runic symbol missing
one missing a runic
walls have considerable Oh haters and it
did great it's very boring right it's
very boring and but but like it's also
like it's his kind of movie which can be
boring but it took 12 years to think and
so and you know I think the problem is a
lot of people are getting caught up on
this whole 12 years to make thing which
it doesn't matter how long it takes to
make a movie all that matters is the
movie right what do we say space cop is
gonna space cop is taking seven years to
make that means it's gonna be almost as
good as Boyd
you heard it here for a space cop almost
as good as Boyett campy as good boy it
took 12 years to me space cowboy I took
said
all the things and how to hear all these
things
oh here we go and boss and boss here we
go
boring it goes good or bad well no it's
I mean boring can be good boring can be
bad I don't think it's definitive
the central nervous system is located at
the base of this structure okay great
should probably skin
like flower guy this your plan is the
source of toxic water in the roads
pharkas growth cycle those barracks
exhilarated as a result air requires
their Kazakh exposure to solar energy to
remain active this exposure has made
flowers outer shell thick and durable as
low root systems it's up for negative
honourable however exploit this flaw
when possible comes right weapon fire a
day isn't for short periods okay so
here's the question you you get badass
samus armor right super badass samus
armor you can shoot missiles in your
missile gun thing I have to shoot these
things would be my guess you get super
badass missiles and armor that lets you
roll into a ball and like fucking walk
and lava and double jump right oh here
we go
there we go I see I found it but every
time you scan something and you have to
scan things in order to figure it out
you hear that voice is it worth it
is it worth it for the super badass
armor if you have to hear that voice
this is this is the important question
I'm gonna go ahead and say no oh maybe
I'm gonna go ahead and say maybe
okay now what do I have to do I need to
pay attention he falls down do I shoot
his face
maybe not his face
don't necessarily know what to do after
I shoot down the thing so that's gonna
be
I said something gets exposed when he
falls down oh we gonna oh oh okay oh
that's it okay that's it there we go
there we go we figured it out mom I'll
just figure it out great
oh you there the great jobs boosts your
eyes inspired and that's what you hear
every time you you like have this badass
fight with like an alien
Scyther worm you hear like your chozo
friends be like Oh Salle's you're the
strongest said the best thank you so
much for protecting the universe
think there we go is it worth it is it
worth it to be the badass space hunter
pirate if you hear that voice all time
I'm gonna say yeah worth it oh hey now
hey now
this is much faster
ow ow ow what the frig man
how did you get back up already needed
Tim nope nope nope
what is going on here with all these
okay okay it's gonna move faster fuck
you Scyther
he looks like a poke of ideas either
mikeycal you upside there okay got a
stun them first then hit one thing and
come over here and hit another thing is
what I'm assuming
okay so now two of them are down so now
this thing goes away
fuck you hit me when you go away okay
we've talked about I always we've talked
about my favorite Pokemon for a while I
always have a soft spot for poison-type
pokémon I don't know why and they're
they're weak against so many things but
I love poison-type pokémon I think
they're cool
yeah I think they're super dope and
co-op
I know my Energy's low I know I'm gonna
die I'm probably gonna die
like I do I got
I move slightly faster in my ball form
so I gotta
okay movin
oh that's right I have fucking missiles
I forgot that it missiles I'm a dweebus
if it's three I got it is it three is
the three did I get it dick I forgot I
forgot that I have missiles I know I see
I see the chat now I forget I shit
there's another one oh there's energy
though there's Energon cubes
I'll get those Energon cubes fuck didn't
do me just good nope nope did I that I
died he got me somehow damn it when was
my life save too long ago probably when
was my last save
it was a while ago is that gonna be oh
look at that didn't get any of that yet
oh my dingus that's what you get for not
paying attention right well no you know
I figured it out I've won a hundred
percent should have saved after I got
some of my dinguses oh yeah yeah well
we'll leave it here for now I don't want
to go through all that again
Oh my dingus is that was fun though

all three prime games for ten bucks all
guys that worth it Jack sorry for asking
this but what was your favorite GameCube
game I mean I there was a bunch I really
enjoyed prime Luigi's Mansion I think
was a really underrated launch title a
really fun game really interesting you
know I really like that what else was
like there are so many cubes Super Mario
Sunshine is something that comes up in
chat a lot like rich and I will talk
about our love of Super Mario Sunshine
and how for some reason people hate it
on Super Mario Sunshine but that was
just the goddamn best game so many cube
games are great they just there weren't
there weren't enough of them you know
and and the ps2 and the Xbox were out
there just weren't enough cube games for
it to be successful and fortunately but
Oh spore what Luigi's Mansion was
totally fun Pikmin I never really got
into I never really got into Pikmin I
want to try that again I do want to try
it there there's the new Pikmin for Wii

smart about that that was a that was a
you know game about trying to get busy
and obviously not the best wand and
listen I had so much fun playing space
quest that one bad game is not gonna
turn me off to it so don't worry I know
that jumpy it's alright
oh that's right it had sunshine it had
Wind Waker it and Wind Waker were rushed
in half finished
you are wrong bleeped Jax sunshine and
Wind Waker are fantastic games Wind
Waker particularly I'm sure the HD
remake is even better but Wind Waker is
a beautiful one of my favorite Zelda
games Wind Waker is could be my most
favorite Zelda game I think it's
beautiful I think it's beautiful and
wonderful you were a Nintendo fan during
the bit Wars Jack I mean yeah usually I
also for a while I didn't have a
Nintendo system and so I just kind of
wished I did I had we had like the weird
Genesis and Saturn's and
HG windwaker is the most beautiful is
the most beautiful I don't I don't know
why sunshine got a bad rap either it was
because it was different you know it was
easy to make fun of because you were you
know a janitor because you can end up
the goop but I really loved the sunshine
I thought it was I thought it was great
I have not played Sorkin Jack if you
don't have all the friend games it's a
good time to pick them up on the Wii U e
