are we acceptable here are we and
unacceptable whatever level for whatever
for acceptability I don't want to spend
the next hour fucking around with trying
to fix audio and I don't know what the
fuck I'm doing with audio or are you
even seeing a stream I guess it's
another equally equally acceptable
question sounds great alright well I'll
take that all right it's nothing I'm not
even gonna try no death run because I'm
not I'm not familiar enough with the ins
and outs of of Dead Rising 2 so I'm just
gonna play the game there will be there
will be saving if I'm dying there will
be reloading
yes this first time I've played off the
record i clawed my way I will Ahmet
fought hard don't cover the truth of
what happened at that mall
things were good real good
while
I'll let things get to me
I let things get out of control
I think deep down
things got pretty dark
this is my chance to get back in the
game the song the opening song which I
love is called halfway dead you can find
it on the youtubes
the first mission is not to feed Reynold
he he died of obesity between the first
and second Ronald is dead he had a hard
time while choking on a ham sandwich oh
yeah I get it back in the games art it's
bad up what is it kid
I signed your waiver you got my next of
kin of a vultures circle and already
yeah
sorry sir it's just paperwork they want
it from everyone would you mind if I got
your autograph
sure
sorry about that it's just
it's been a lot
you've always been a big hero mine mr.
West I was really bummed when you're
showing off the air wow thanks
so I guess this be worth quite a bit if
anything happening out there tonight
yeah
I guess snow
good luck
this wasn't such a bad idea after all
Frank is doing a celebrity guest
appearance on a zombie game show it's
been I think five or six years since
dead lies in one
for a show rematch of all romantics
now Frank's gotta kill zombies to earn
cash bigger to death they're gonna pay
them especially if those corner Grimes
yeah I I kind of like that they aged
Frank he's he's a lot fatter and just
generally his face looks older but if
you consider that he's been fighting off
zombie ism he's infected it kind of
makes sense
oh god I don't have my old loose things
that rising one and it's gonna throw me
off
buying pants are killing me
salon the goal here is to earn points by
killing zombies the bonus points by
knocking them into the grinders
what the fuck indeed whoever you are I
will thank you later
Misner won thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it that's true I
really know
yeah yes
yep my mate goddamnit
point at us I thought I would but I got
gold happy about that
no Jack tonight's just me
I believe I have unlimited help about
this first portion here
we're tired of us he's got plenty of
hair for all his faults in his weight
gain he still got here
games are okay I guess I'm new zombies
are popping up all the time they're easy
to replenish
fuck
je frisk - thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it
the difference between this and regular
dead rising - well obviously there is
the the main character other than that
I'd like as first time I played this I
know they've added in some some
Psychopaths and I know there's a whole
new area of the map they added in like a
whole section other than that I'm not
really sure I know there's some some
story alterations but I've heard they're
relatively minor no this is not an O
death row and I'm not familiar enough
with Dead Rising the ad - to make such a
an attempt
I I will be saving and reloading I'm not
going to play through the whole damn
game tonight but I think in general I'm
just gonna play through this game did I
like dead rise or dead rising 2 more
obviously you've not seen any of my dead
rising streams yeah I'm kind of vocal
about loving dead rising one more but
they're both fine games
is the moral of dead rising to still
Americans are so fat now the moral of
dead rising to is that drug companies
are evil
all right I know they do the camera
really weird and this one
you're talking about sports fan costumes
is the first time I've actually played
off the record so I'm not familiar with
them
I'm assuming there are unlimited
pictures in this version
I gotta get back to my show
hey there boys you're late for the
autographs
get away
let me take a door
come on come on come on no weapons up no
weapons fuck fuck
what I got beat up
call me feel for a photo shoot
oh well
your performance
you must have to take pills
good night ladies
so I turn fast
I'm used to I'm used to regular dead
rising to isn't the daughter in here
decent axe just about set to break
though
I bet you still silly
50 guitar lessons
well not as fun as the Dead Rising one
guitar
you lost Dale what will we do really
you're gonna beat I figured he would
shove the newspaper in like the zombies
Bob
Jeremiah
all those to reflect
this runs so much better on PC that it
did the PlayStation 3 which kind of ran
like crap
oh and then in the green room you can
see that the daughters back oh no with
with blood smears
see I don't think the CDs are Shaun of
the Dead reference because the same
weapon was in Dead Rising one and I
think I think that came out before off
Shaun of the Dead been wrong before
shard the dead was 2004 Dead Rising was
2006 you sure the first one was 2006 I
guess it was
I know you could be name's Frank Frank
West
don't worry it's under control
Thanks we got these hombres here
military have to quarantine first
they'll enter the city at first light
three days from now that's the standard
procedure
so we're stuck here
No
I'm assuming this is um a shelter
designed specifically with zombies and
mine why the fuck wouldn't they have any
of the anti zombie drugs in the anti
zombie shelter that is the dumbest
fucking thing I've ever heard maybe like
you're the number one thing you'd want
to stock right right before food and
water
zomb Rex
I figured you were infected though I
don't remember you saying anything about
that in your book
advertise
there's a pharmacy in the Royal Flush
mall
I'm Stacy Forsyte by the way I'm Frank
Frank Frank West
but if you find one
and Frank if you find anyone alive out
there
game audio up I don't give me a second
I'll change that to second survivors
I do like the Bluetooth thing all right
I'm gonna turn game audio up
and while I'm at it change one other
thing
and risk fuckin up our son because why
not why not do that why not do that
stupid stupid thing makes perfect sense
perfect perfect sense
I didn't work for me but the audio
should be fine for you which I guess is
what's important
can't you Frank West bottled up
bread crumb gaming you're saying it you
you you're you you bought it on ps3 and
hated it years ago but now now you're
loving it on the PC it's probably cuz it
runs a lot better I know the original
Dead Rising kind of runs like Dead
Rising 2 runs like crap what happens if
you take Zombrex and you're not infected
I imagine it's just a waste I believe
Zombrex is just a a hormone that keeps
the zombie bee larva from developing and
your head so probably do nothing totally
not Jake thank you for subscribing we
really appreciated anybody else knows it
I'm caught up actually I don't think I
said KGB ate my bread thank you for
subscribing and also mr. won and fatty
Muslim thank you all for subscribing we
really appreciate it
I fell well I do whatever a number of
months in a row I'm sure it's something
exciting
no fun jump right in there show my god
zombie seem faster which I don't feel
about that I like slow zombies
nice slow manageable zombies
yeah they're still pretty slow I'm
saying they seem faster than they were
in the original Dead Rising - that's all
well so I don't like the blood effects
that that's straight line up blood
around his back that is just distracting
and oh god I need food apparently not as
that is easy totally gonna die this
sucks
fuck
how's he not dead
holy fuck holy fuck
not good those life-saving cookies Frank
eat them eat the cookie so they I think
technically I died already with that
opening part and the the henchman
characters this is totally not gonna be
no decimal
just leveling up oh fuck
holy fuck getting my ass beat redheaded
stepchild
fantastic
come on don't lie to me don't hey don't
you have something better to do why
don't you mind your own business old man
just looking for some meds well you're
definitely gonna need some painkillers
I'm done with you
well talking to you is giving me a
headache oh yeah
what say you give me some money and I'll
go get something for you yeah give us
some money grandpa how about it grandpa
you got any money
they sure think he's a grandpa now Frank
does not need to keep the old one
apparently they hint that the little
girl is dead so sucks to be a little her
that's weird their mouths are moving but
nothing this no sound is coming out why
bother why bother with live animation
that is so weird
weapon to give you a lady shut up
why'd you let's move
all right I've heard it's a little bit
harder to escort survivors in this one
so we'll we'll see about that
it could be harder this is the more
aggressive zombies I don't know
yeah look at oh sure I grasp they can
get they can get grabbed it off the
record more easy
that's that's the thing
I suppose hurry it up is better than
follow me
getting around is not as easy
that's right Frank
you'd be a jerk he saved need things
that poor lady he's just trying to live
oh fuck fuck
Oh checkpoints yeah whatever whatever
I never claimed this is a no death run
I'm not I'm not I'm not this is the
first time I've actually played off the
record I play Dead Rising 2 but off the
record is new to me and the new the new
button for throwing this the ring me off
- you're getting a better weapon so this
chair works out
that's the psycho the psycho noise is a
nice touch but wasting my time changed
up too much for the button you use to
aim and throw throw me : oh god damn it
I need a better weapon okay she's able
to get through a crowd with decently on
her own I like that that it's not easy
to us water all right all right I'm fine
with that
oh no dead front of us feeling
lots more difficult I think the dead
rising one I feel I feel very weak I
feel weaker right now than I do at level
one in original dead rising it's not
like he's such a jerk
keep up yeah the zombies are a lot
harder to avoid they're fucking me up
what is what is Frank West doing in Dead
Rising I'm out of the game myself I'd
you like the the Frank West model I made
is my mod I don't know if I get a
perfect job on the face and there's a
lotta people keep telling me it looks
like Dan Aykroyd but on the whole I
think I did great
move it
oh yeah you have to pay for the mod yeah
it's a $20 I put a lot of work into it
maybe changed a lot of things in the
game I I did you know like give her a
Katy and make it so Frank was the one
who's taking the Zombrex I mean I did a
lot of work
yeah so if you if you send me $20 I'll
just send you a version of the game with
the mods pre-installed we won't be able
to play the regular dead rise but just
send me $20 and I'll give you the modded
version is that cool
all right so what I don't know is does
he take the Zombrex automatically I mean
I know I made this mod and I should know
this
but let's just say I'm not sure how I
made it when I made it
hey keep up
keep up you jerk you don't get nowhere
near as many points with the pictures I
don't like that
give him a crowbar no I'm almost we're
almost there
it's a waste
what Frank Frank it takes selfies in
this one that sounds appropriate
as the game to loud now guys told me to
turn the game sound up I did you don't
like it let me know I'll I'll bring it
back down
all right bad sir by far the best one
oh they're so grabby in this one Wow
so grabby grabby amygz um bees
deadly anger ID I could I guess I you
know honor I imagine I could pull off an
a no death run of the original Dead
Rising 2 I don't know if I could do it
with this one it seems like they've made
some definitely made some changes to
make it more difficult which is fine
that's good I like I'm not if I want a
challenge
still personal tummies first up kind of
this will slow they're a lot faster than
they used to be say that there is what
he spend the money on there's a pawn
shop where you could buy fancy weapons
and and Zombrex and all manner of things
what off Jesus Christ outran me the
zombies can outrun you now
all right it's fun but it's very
impractical
and her one the vanilla version there
should be I like some guy who was
hanging out on these streets fighting
for his life
I don't I don't know what they changed
in this edition you're definitely not
saying any kind of icons for somebody
who needs to be saved
Oh in that ironic
one can I get into the make make a
weapon room back
what why are you going to that menu now
to pay the stick
what I want to see the watch just we get
rid of the watch how do I check times
things
what does the right trigger do change
things up I don't know what things do
now back check time on the map okay are
there no objectives for anything right
now wait you have to you have to do it
at the safe house oh that's annoying why
would he have to do it at the safe house
he's got the Zombrex on them just just
stick yourself with a needle that's dumb
I'm gonna go all the way back no I'm
gonna now I'm gonna die on my way back I
don't die from that I'll become a zombie
well fuck my nuts am
Oh guess you can't do it alright I guess
they didn't alter that from the regular
Dead Rising 2 because in the case file
and said destination safe house
this thing the broom doesn't break in
this one and turn into a much more
useful item
oh it does okay
stabs not quite as quick as it was in
one but I'll take it okay it's better
than nothing I'll take it
once this game seemed so much slower
well I imagine there are speed upgrades
you can get for Frank West that I just
don't have unlocked yet because you
start off Dead Rising one pretty slow on
my my my glorious no death perfect Dead
Rising run that I did just recently I I
did somewhat luckily get to speed
upgrades pretty early on so my walking
speed to pretty much all of that game
was good
roll them dice I'll roll them guys later
I want to get back to the case file and
son of a bitch fuck off probably save
while I'm at the safe house I'm just I'm
hoping I can say that save us that
second camp

yeah if shits if shit's gettin awful in
the chat mods you f you have permission
just to start banning whoever's where's
being an idiot
flat a bantam I don't give a shit I
don't know what's going on in there
because I got too much focus going on
with this game but I don't I don't
tolerate no shit
put lay the smackdown on them
outside I got kill I'm swimming 11
minutes in game time which shouldn't be
that long
all right I'll wait
all right ready to stab you Stacy any
moment ready to stab you
you just look look she's like looking
over her shoulder ever like what the
fuck are you doing what what the fuck
are you doing Frank West no I don't know
I'm gonna stab you with my broom I'm
gonna stab you with my goddamn room
broom broom that room broom you know
what I mean
am I going to do a perfect Dead Rising
to run probably not I'd probably want to
do one full run-through at least one
full run-through before I even tried it
just so I know when things you know just
familiarize person with when things
happen I mean where I need to be when I
need to be there who I need to save how
many people it's like a timing thing
your group's got a reputation but come
on your had nothing to do with this it's
pretty easy to say that
you're gonna need more than that
better start talking right now I'm
telling you we're being set up we've
been accused of things before but we
don't believe in violence for someone's
convenient excuse oh really it's not the
first time members of cure have been
falsely accused of being involved with
an outbreak I've gotta find
damn TK and his horrible show I'm not
saying I believe you something's not
right here that's for damn sure
I needed something to get back again
I investigate this maybe I get back to
doing what I do best that reported where
is she she said she was in the hotel
I know this could end up being a big
chance for your career
this could mean my life
person in the chat saying that the magic
of my dead rising one no death run can't
be replicated oh there will be other
games and other attempts I'm gonna do it
again and won't be with Dead Rising
again that would be insane but I'm
thinking either Ninja Gaiden Sigma next
or zone of the enders one but I will
certainly attempt a no death run again
there's a guy playing the slots in the
Americana casino he just keeps going and
going almost weird
it seems like I'm dropping frames the
the the game is pausing because every
time I hit right on my d-pad which you
have to do to answer the the phone for
some reason that that brings up a steam
in game menu and I don't know why it's
decided to make that Association I gotta
I gotta figure that out I mean I had the
I to jump through hoops to get Dead
Rising 2 off the record to recognize my
gamepad in the first fucking place so I
don't know don't worry about that some
other damn time probably got a play till
10 and then I'm done four out of ten
target six I think it's fair for hours
and there are spikes in this game
Phoenix are you are you around Phoenix
does you have it where you go one of the
few times I like spikes in a game
why is rich playing this shitgame
because he felt like it the only reason
I need
under the wonder if the secret Zombrex
is still in this game in this version I
mean in this version of this mod I made
so I know whether or not it's there or
not I'm just trying there you know space
nice ever I don't see the Zombrex Oh
oh no they got rid of the secrets on
bricks that would make the game slightly
harder
you know what I forgot to drive that
expansion oh well whatever to grab the
axe didn't grab the eggs forgot the eggs
excuse me
oh I'm not gonna be expected hey this
man
I kill him do I get the money back
let's move
and it's me what the map which was the
safe house we're pretty good with a
two-by-four keep using that 2x4
hey I'm waiting on you that's not the
way nope that's not the right way we're
going this way
I kind of like the zombies just at the
slots they used to be in life that's a
nice touch good evening John B 8:20 I
might I might wrap the stream up at any
minute I'm not sure what I'm gonna call
it but I'm gonna call him
maybe I'll just screw around until I die
that'll be the end
that's different
there's a gotcha zombie
be the boss first I'm not even sure
where to find the boss in this one let
alone know that I'm gonna beat them I
don't know I don't know this game near
as well as I do the first one sir
what do I save lady lady tell me where
to save I'm assuming I could save in the
safe room
it's gonna be a bathroom in here at
least right
can you not save in the safe room that
would be stupid
that would be that you know what that
would be too stupid to be true too
stupid to be true there's got to be a
bathroom in here I'm wasting so much
time looking for it
nope
where's their cot here this cop can I
save here no no no no
checkpoints I hate the idea of
checkpoints why save on my own like a
big boy when we grow up we learned to do
things from our ourselves and then they
invent checkpoints and take that all
away from us it's not right damn it it's
not right
whenever I restart a game that is loaded
from a checkpoint it feels like I'm
starting a different game somebody else
is saved not my own it's weird but
mentally that that switch isn't there
when I start from my own save it's like
okay this is where I left off
I like I like safe points where you go
to save yourself or manual saving where
you open the menu and tell the game to
save wherever you are I'm not so fond of
checkpoints I'll deal with them because
I kind of have to this is do security
box what's that I'm completely
unfamiliar with that phenomenon
yes I need to mod some safe ones I need
to mod out the checkpoints the automatic
checkpoints yeah
let's rock I could deal with autosave on
quick cuz they see you know I would be
quitting the game and if it started from
where I left off when I quit that I'm
okay with that that is acceptable
it's after 10:00 I don't know what I'm
gonna call him I'll call it at some
point
I mean I already think I screwed up a
little I'm not even a no deathrun but a
perfect one I don't like the fact that
I've dyed to those guys clearly on the
game just continued on like nothing ever
happened
that bugs me that bugs me get off me you
zombie scum I think some kind of yield
suit should be a combo item in this
woman the zombies can't grab you wear
like a slimy suit maybe you could like
combine Crisco with with some kind of
latex fetish suit and then yeah it's an
untouchable suit that's the combo item
there I just made a Dead Rising combo
item and they need to put that in the
game I need to mod that in yeah I'm
gonna mob that in when I get a chance
yeah I started at six I've gone for
hours already
Jack's not around because I don't I
don't have children so when Jack's not
around I tend to start earlier cuz I
can't under worry about putting someone
to bed you know do what the fuck I want
what I want to why the fuck not
duh ninety four nails
and I found nails
I don't resent Jack for having kids I
don't mind starting later I have no
problem with with the later starts but I
mean if I'm free and I've been nothing
particularly better to do I'll you know
I I'll start earlier I'll start a little
bit earlier
I'll see if that guy whoever ever being
outside and the original Dead Rising 2
was is outside by now maybe I just had
to wait
yeah you get the cameras like like
worthless now and it's I guess it's nice
that it's back at all but I'm getting
like so many points for this for using
these these gloves and I get like next
to shit for a photo 169 or I could punch
somebody and get a lot more
I mean if you're gonna put the camera
back in which I like make it useful
don't don't make it worthless
I guess that guy just doesn't spawn in
this version of the game
all right walk a bit further down just
to make sure I don't know there is I
think is that no that's a street sign I
thought that was a help so far let's
Street side I thought it was a health
bar it's not
my guess is upbeat meet Rebecca Chang
why the fuck not the most underrated
weapons that rising one is the purse and
it's better it's better than
off-the-record really great you move a
lot faster
boys by the rayna's own i'll girl
whatever it's fine it's fine
amateur looks like your zombie chow now
you need to pay attention out here I
know you you used to be a kind of a hero
of mine before you got washed up you
homesick for zombies what are you doing
here
Hey I came to help with your story I
think yours being set up my exclusive
tape says otherwise and I don't exactly
need your help
it doesn't have to be a contest lady I
help you you help me
where'd you get that tape from darling
reporters don't reveal their sources
Frank not real ones anyway
I wouldn't underestimate Frank West
sweetheart I got some pictures you might
be interested in
okay
see what you got
not so fast you gotta throw the old dog
a bone before he does any tricks okay
maybe I'll let you tag along for a while
that's more like it I can't tell you my
source but there is a central security
room
there'll be footage of everything that
happened there I can show you where it
is well you show me yours I'll show you
mine where's your
they ran off with all the equipment I
guess they just didn't want it bad
enough
that's my saying once again saved by a
woman with a pistol who shoots zombie in
the head glass moment technically Brad
did the same thing that's the third time
Frank has been rescued with a pistol at
the last minute
alright I'm gonna find out what the
security boxes do I have no idea so much
for that chainsaw wrote her what she saw
like a little shave ball room
oh shit I'm sorry Rebecca Chang
yeah
no at least there used to be I don't
know what they've changed but they used
to be a nice where you run off to face
oh that felt good that felt good
I'm not gonna lie I remember that
chainsaws were kind of bad in vanilla
Dead Rising 2 but I want to see if
they're more like they were in Dead
Rising 1 and off the record because that
would be sweet I missed the fun chainsaw
okay find one do they take it out of
that game nothing we're a few of them
just lying around in the construction
area
huh huh
that's my favorite zombie movie I'll top
my head original Dawn of the Dead I
thought about it for a while I might
remember one I like more I'm not sure
there we go oh they changed the colors
trouble now
now that's not as fun you just be able
to run and cut now you can't
it's like worthless now fucking I do
have what's that
don't worry I'm gonna get the paddle
what do you think I'm looking for the
combo room for
I don't die first rock
that fuckers in here right there we go
I know what vex stole the restroom I
don't care I'm making a paddle sob we'll
go back to the Rebecca it's fine
I don't think I'm don't think I'm doing
a hardcore playthrough right now I'm I'm
just kind of kind of playing seriously
kind of having fun was it bad
where's mr. Chang
oh I'm not beating it tonight I could
stop the stream at any moment any moment
then constraining z6 it is currently
10:30
technically I started ten to four six
nine five headed before six no it's
right before 10:30
that's a good meaty stream
I don't like that one patch bright by
his butts like a rectangle patch that
you won't get bloody that's so weird
is it down musical goodbye battle song
are you going around like that crazy
woman you're a crazy woman
stop being so crazy crazy woman
let me try
you went to journalism school
what a mess
this just gets better and better Wow
looks like somebody didn't like the show
much you should get this on video
they didn't wants to see what really
went down
don't use guns
I'm not so sure Kyra's not involved but
it definitely proves someone's covering
up what really happened not a badly
kiddo
now it's time to show me those pictures
I'm on my way
wait who was that just a friend
the leader of cure gotta go
so riven 53 this game sucks I'm just
curious how do you feel about the first
one this is the series you don't like
hers at this game
cuz I like one more but I mean two's
alright it's not like terrible or
anything I got blood on my back proper
that's nice
flashlight there's more protective than
I don't remember it they change that Zoo
feel like a jerk Griffin I mean you're
allowed to not like a game there's
nothing wrong with that it's not your
thing it's not your thing
but the fact that his ass would not get
blood on it in a perfect like rectangle
shape was just distracting it was just
horribly distracting I'm sorry I know
that's weird just the room that's
supposed to have the KD backpack
I guess I just missed it for good
nope right
nope nope nope nope nope do
money things at night
come on not big job not a big deal
I'm gonna find out what the security box
is doing it's so weird I don't think
those are in vanilla Dead Rising 2
that's some fun stuff
why did she shoot me I get too close
Oh
so here you chuckling about Dead Rising
3 Sport agonist I haven't I haven't
played Dead Rising 3 what's what's wrong
with the Dead Rising 3 s protagonist I
don't think the people in charge of this
series now I heard one of the camp on
Vancouver or whoever I just don't I
don't think they know what a good
protagonist is they can't they can't
handle that shockingly I don't want to
take a shotgun from you here
oh there might not be the way to go
ships Spitfire we have Spitfire
let's go seems to work differently than
it did last time it doesn't work at all
it's crap they ruin spit fire it doesn't
do jack shit my dreams of beating the
last boss with spit fire are gone
I know Frank looks uglier I did my best
with the mod I did my best
better check it out after I get back
probably not gonna make it in time and
that's what this is not a serious
pleasure
so we're not gonna make of all these
damn zombies are they following me
yep
yeah
guy in a yellow jacket which guy -
yellow jacket nice white a bunch of
shotguns
oh we're dead we're dead and I think I
think our stream is about to come to an
end yeah I hope you've all had fun
tonight I appreciate everybody coming
out it's been fun playing uh not a hero
it's been fun playing Dead Rising 2 off
the record I'm assuming jack will be a
part of any stream that's going on
Sunday so things should be somewhat back
to normal at that point I don't really
have have much to say other than have a
good night
and
