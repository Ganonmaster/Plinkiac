manner that displeases you I'm a 4:20

Dali ain't got nothing on me
so I Sperling says Happy New Year rich

think it won't have to take another one
for a long time
Charlotte M 3 so stay rich been a while
since I caught a live screen livestream
because of my job sorry sweetie
I wanted to wish you a Happy New Year at
the Memphis Tennessee mr. cuddles says
hi rich just wondering if you see Jessie
much lately how is she doing she's doing
fine
hello anybody here rich I hate the way
you read comments sorry what do you want
me to do
Katie stay right here don't do that
don't do that voice but my reading voice
hey that's my truck
the Zombrex have you seen the Dead
Rising movies on crackle they are free
I've seen part of one of them there were
so many fucking advertisements I I had
to stop watching the first one it was
like every minute there was five minutes
of odds
we're okay no honey
the canvases what are you going to speed
run dead rising one overtime mode the
world record is 11:59 I you don't speed
run much I've never speed run dead
rising one overtime mode
daddy loves you so much I have to go get
some more Zombrex and figure out how to
get us out of here
I know honey but it's very important you
need another one before bedtime you stay
here I promise I'll be back as soon as I
can those bad nothing's gonna stop me
from keeping you safe see how long you
can go without dying of boredom but see
how long you can go without dying of
boredom
I'm not playing The Last of Us
damn right all right I got the spikebat
from the start this time and we now know
we cannot spend much time fucking around
also I need to have probably at least
two good health items on me at any given
time or at least before I give Katy her
last saw brick shot
yeah the end of the game is after you
get the bike
idiot idiot me
maybe it's you can only level up to
level 5 in this I forget what it is it's
not very high the zombies are kind of
unimpressive yeah it's not this isn't a
zombie extreme combat game though like I
said the zombies are just kind of mild
obstacles
they're fun to play around with alright
I get a game I get it
Oh
yeah that's
isn't the real story here the outrageous
costume Zombrex a supply and demand
oh thank god
yeah I can fix this
chat which spider-man trailer you talked
about the Miles Morales one sounds all
right
I don't I don't have any special
connection to the character of Miles
Morales
I've never read any comic that
characters been in so it's I mean it's
hard for me to get super excited about
Miles Morales movie he's he's fine I
guess the jittery movements style with
weird and it's story wise if it's a
bunch of alternate universe spider-man
running around and that's something I'm
particularly interested in
I recommend Dead Rising 2 on PlayStation
3 um I don't remember how well it runs
on the ps3
I'd recommend the Steam version it's on
Steam it's a good game I personally like
one more but I I might be in the
minority on that hold on honey
everything's gonna be just fine
daddy's got to go get a few things I
can't give it to you too early honey
it's dangerous you'll get too much
daddy can fix me anything
Miles Morales is completely fine if you
establish earlier that spider-man is
more of a title than a character I never
bought into that logic I don't really
care much for legacy characters like
remember that character you know and
love's not a gun it's some new guy now
if I'm if I'm a fan of a character and
you were you know Superman's now Daryl
Darby who got Superman powers I don't
give a shit about that character I've
been reading about Clark Kent for 30
years 40 years wherever long it's been
Batman isn't that Bruce Wayne and really
care I don't I don't I hate legacy
characters now it's the new guy I don't
know the new guy
nice
and if any character is is not just the
title its spider-man spider-man has
always been Peter Parker first and
foremost is the person under the mask
who cared about and miles might be a
great character you might be a 5
character I've I've just never read a
single Miles Morales a spider-man comic
book and I just don't care I don't I
don't know miles spider-man to me was
always Peter Parker
okay I got it rich is so metric look if
I get repetitive Jim do you have any
idea how often people ask me the same
fucking questions all the time I assume
I need to to hammer home my points or
just never going to stop
are you follow me or what hell let's get
for being an ass
I accidentally trigger a help item I
think I did
which do you hate Xbox well as a general
rule I just prefer the PC for gaming
that's less a matter of me hating the
Xbox I hate the 360 specifically just
because the hardware's a piece of crap
I've I've never owned a 360 that hasn't
died on me within a short time span
after getting it up to and including the
one I'm playing this on now the the disk
drive has stopped working on this I can
to get the disc drive to open
just like mom used to make
I don't know if I can destroy the bike
parts um I don't think I'm gonna risk
trying by swinging them around
willy-nilly I'm just kind of think about
where I'm gonna find a sword oh we still
need to locate like one of the bike
perches in general I don't know where it
is all right I've got my work cut out
for me
what is dead rising stack up to Red Dead
Redemption undead nightmare for me there
they're different beasts though undead
nightmare is actually a really good
zombie game it's got that that sense of
dread that sense of the end times
that's fine
faster just want to bring the guitar
with me now a guitar don't throw the
bike thing over there what's it all
right come on everybody let's go let's
go
we're burning daylight
marriage is a flawed concept or maybe a
dated one emerges fine he's got to find
the right person man I'll jump into it
without giving it a lot of thought
I appreciate that
and if you ask tell Bundy he he was a
fictional character you know Al Bundy
and he probably shouldn't been in that
marriage with peg in the first place
wicked
does it remain necessary well it's not
necessary it's an optional thing and it
always has been
my husband's okay you know in ancient
times I guess there were arranged
marriages so I guess it hasn't marriage
hasn't always been optional depending
upon where you live or what gender you
were still
I'm crying about your gonna be ready to
cry about your gems so I can get the
gems earlier this time lady
all right Bob you're gonna tell me about
that bachelorette party all right so
that's not available yet I guess first I
could put some money to buy some things
I'll need
tip
yes
the engine that we buy the wheel we know
who's got the handlebars I think that's
everything then I almost made it last
time didn't I
I came damn close wait no so I got it in
my hands right now this doesn't count as
I do need to find another one all right
hey rich what are you doing at midnight
for New Year's your wife maybe marriage
wasn't such a good idea after all
that's not sure
all right
dark Jack Wolf's six six sixes I don't
have enough money to get something to
eat
so have my last two dollars Happy New
Year you hack fraud I'm gonna go get
shit-faced spite my scriptures up man
you got to give me two bucks you need
the money man
so still no wedding checks available
that's fine
here they're gonna wait until I get this
particular bike part intimate they're
doing really good on time or I just
haven't triggered it yet
Oh five if that was to back to the
casino
I love gambling well this isn't a bad
option if all there is oh wait no I need
this oh I should have loved that zombie
there and see if maybe the wheel bunker
on the head
that would have been sweet
what are you crying about
right on
chat once once you're a zombie I'm
pretty sure you're you're beyond
identifying as anything you know you
know what gender zombies identify as
brains that's that's their that's their
gender identity braids
so I'm still too early for the rescuing
them ladies you gotta give me that tip
about that or do I even need the tip
about it from you can I just go and
rescue them well they will they show up
anyway yeah that's weird
let's see if we get that down
bike from dudes just want the beer
so I need the broadsword
I know the swords in here I know there's
like a key to get in here
I don't recall where that happens to be
is it just rough access it might just be
rough access
yeah I think I get in through there
which means I got to get across probably
have to go around the world here
that's got some decent durability if I
had to criticize the combo weapons does
kind of discourage me from using other
stuff it's like why would I switch
something else when I have this bat bat
does good damage and has great longevity
yeah better way up there there a better
way to do this I can get there from one
of the windows in the hotel I'll try
that I'll try that
I wonder where the recipe of the lady's
mission hasn't written yet
I know it just gets me Harold
it's not good for my time this is not
good at all
is there a different window I can go out
of get out here they're probably not no
no wait I can't holy shit how so much
easier
this actually I'm not hunting here right
this one
all right good
this is good this is new
where's the key to get in here Oh
Oh
yes
then I get more swords here
all right that's good it stores anytime
I want now
all right I'm assuming they only spawn
near the end
these dudes probably alright so what's
the last bike part I need I have a
handlebars from them I know I'm gonna
get the handlebars later there's one
other part I need and I don't know where
it might be even
gascan from the station from the gas
station right in front of the gas
station son of a bitch I was so close
last time I just had to finish their
stupid quest
oh fuck
right there right there
all right we're looking good to do it
this time
things are looking up
don't waste the thort I can I can pretty
much you get another one whatever I want
now
s-some 1984 says happy new years rich
thanks for the stream within New Year
bring more celebrity sex pervert outings
North Korea threats and Cubs choking in
the playoffs keep on rockin thank you
James farces Happy New Year orig happy
New Year to you too James frog which is
that is that a reference to Jamie farm
by chance or no no it's not like don't I
have another
I'm gonna set of nails in here no no
yeah
yes it is a checklist ring Jack should
be back for the next week yeah
all right
now I can rescue the girls a cluster of
them you know what not that exciting
wait you're telling me about them enough
the ladies okay that's weird huh
I guess I don't get to save the ladies
this time
we'll all right
we're gonna buzz by the bowling alley
and see if the ladies are there even
though I didn't get the and I didn't
efficiently get the quest no way and I
can't risk losing the handlebars for
trapping these dudes off first and the
handlebars
Ritt rich is obsessed with saving
everyone that's what I was obsessed with
for crying out loud
thank you
but we'll see if the game automatically
goes into the ending after I fixed the
bike
it might I'm kind of curious nice place
to visit but I ain't gonna die here
played never played kaise here I can't
played this case arrow before it just
has been years and I don't know that
I've ever finished the bike this early
before I mean I've only played this like
two or three times total
ain't you a beauty
damn straight
all right he's not gonna tell me about
the girls
they are they're good
Oh
son of a bitch
we got this this time we got this she's
infected my saver because because there
is a medicine in this game that even if
you're infected prevents you from
turning into a zombie but you need to
take this medicine for the rest of your
life
I should be good on medicine I'm not
worried
what is Chuck's long-term plan he can't
keep doing odd jobs to get Katie's
Zombrex indefinitely he could keep
working like everyone else to earn the
money to get the things they need he
just there's something else he needs
like you need to work every month just
to afford wherever it is you live
like the zombie outbreaks in Dead Rising
they're usually localized like the rest
of the world is fine this the world of
dead rising is not a full-on zombie
apocalypse it's it's a series of zombie
disaster areas
things I might need to do I might need
one more zomb ryx dope for a last
survivor I need to get but I'm not sure
that the product of some terrorist
attack yes that's the plot of the first
game
five
yes there's a Dead Rising 3 & 4 but
nobody pays any attention to those they
made 3 & 4 after they stopped making
Dead Rising games this is next survivor
the last one or the next two I guess
technically
person in chat if you if you categorize
this as a role-playing game then the
term role-playing game is officially
become useless term because it is now
too broad to mean anything if this is a
role-playing game
I gotta love the psycho reference I'm
not gonna lie milk and pie let's try oh
we get with milk and pie huh some bait
I can I grab the bacon I had to grab the
pot first out of a pan first let's it's
fine quick-step
oh yeah quick step a new one alright
alright alright
we're doing good we're doing very good
don't so good I'm gonna save
time all right
if you wants to kill we actually have
time to kill
damn right all right
better wait until 7:00 before I go out
because I think that's one the last
survivor spawns
I would go outside and kill zombies to
kill the time but she might not spawn if
I'm not if I'm already out there where
she would be I'm not risking it I'm
staying in here
basically I got to save Bob and Bob's
daughter now there's a bobber bill I
thought it was Bob
quite frankly I'm not sure how I save
any of these people our goal was to
build the bike and get out of town
before the government nukes the city and
quite frankly I don't think all these
people are gonna be able to get out on
the bike with me somebody I'm not sure
who I'm saving here I know Katie needs
her medicine
I just I just I hope that I just walk in
all right I've got time to do this don't
worry I got time I got time man man I
got all the time
for fuck's sake
hurry up you fuckers unbelievable
fuckers
we can get this kid in time we got time
it's fine
it's the climax to the game they wanted
to make the last two survivors difficult
they deliberately cut it this close and
I got to be honest I appreciate that
thank you
that should level me up give me full
health oh good five health bars perfect
perfect grab an extra whiskey for the
fight I've got my sword ready I got my
quick step ready I got my shotgun ready
and I got my baseball bat ready we're
gonna kick some fucking ass hey sweetie
I've got your medicine
that wasn't mommy sweetheart
it just look like her hey buddy sorry if
this is your place we just needed to get
some supplies we'll all right
a Leland perfect to complete my
collection the hell are you talking
about the same family for your daughter
then Dead Rising 2 um
this model might be made to look a few
years younger I'm not sure how much
longer after Dead Rising Bob I'm not
sure how long Dead Rising 2 takes place
after this they probably ate through
this or more accurately de-aged her when
they made this listen she's not a zombie
she's just a little girl oh she's gonna
be all right come on now step aside let
okay finish the job
there's no call for that now monkeys
doing you favor better now than later
this is the the second time they've had
this fight because not over my last
playthrough I did not manage my time
madam and actually
they had to make him hateable because he
is right no he's not because this
universe has a medicine that prevents
people from turning into zombies
what
all right shotguns piece of shit
noted
oh you prefer
Oh
take it
my savior for a while but someone gets
you didn't samba soonerlater be sure
that it's just a matter of time vite
ain't doing the government well
why is this guy bad because he was
trying to murder a six-year-old girl who
can be treated with medicine I can't
believe you people man
don't you worry honey daddy won't let
anyone ever take you away not for any
reason
never and by the way no no redneck
anywhere would proclaim that the
government would or should get something
done
which Dead Rising came is the most
serious tone one but not by that much
nice I wonder if the quickstep works
when you're on the bike
all the other people are going to die
and the nuclear apocalypse
all those people we saved nothing hang
on tight honey
I think I think Dead Rising 2 is less
serious by virtue of the the goofy combo
weapons you spend half the game running
around wearing giant boxing gloves with
knives strapped to them I don't think
it's creepy native culture honey
these are father
flip up what bad
not bad
oh shit we're out of Zombrex look if you
noticed I grab I had an extra at the end
of this game because I played too good
wait is this the end of the game yeah
because this is but this is just uh it's
a fancy demo for Dead Rising 2 I know if
you remember Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground
zeroes that came out like a year or
something weird before Metal Gear 5 did
but it was basically a demo for Metal
Gear 5 the phantom pain that's that's
what this was - Dead Rising 2
only that it charges much for it I think
is only five bucks when I came out in
there he's got more songbirds right
there - this guy's so stocked with
Zombrex it's insane a demo that you pay
for yeah but to be fair this does have
content the other one doesn't this map
is unique I'm using some of the goofy
outfits you could wear a unique I didn't
put them all on it run around doing that
but Jed is not in Dead Rising - so you
got you got unique stuff for your $5
honey listen to me we made it this far I
will not stop until you're safe nothing
is more important than that
you understand
let's get going
yeah if you bought Dead Rising 200 360
and you also own this whatever level you
were at the end of this would carry on
into Dead Rising 2 I forgot what the cap
was somewhere between 5 and 20 was the
cap
to the job
the sound Birds taking
idea that the soldier shot the truck
thief that's the only thing that makes
any kind of sense yes I don't know fine
which do you prefer death rise only
wanted to I I prefer dead rising one
because it's a little bit more difficult
and I think they balance the timers
perfectly if you want to if you want to
do all of the missions in Dead Rising
one all the side missions and the main
story you have to know that fucking game
well Dead Rising 2 they improve the path
finding sure but they met escorting
survivors to spend foundations a show in
the vanilla version of Dead Rising 2 as
the zombies you almost never grab
anybody
Dead Rising for even have timers on
expert issues right that's been rising
for doesn't even have escort missions
dead rising Poor's piece of ship that is
not a dead rising handy in any
meaningful way
No
these types of things are dated garbage
it's not like you fade that's just bait
right that's not like an illegitimate
comment that just somebody who's trying
to get me going on a rant I presume
I am going to get ready to call it a
night dig up primers I got things to do
tonight I'm sorry damp I can't stay for
the midnight that's that's why I picked
a shorty game
I'm officially off music though
Oh incidentally I have not delivered you
on other Dead Rising perfect no death
run just saying I know this particular
game is only like two hours long
nonetheless there is your second Dead
Rising perfect no death run all right
