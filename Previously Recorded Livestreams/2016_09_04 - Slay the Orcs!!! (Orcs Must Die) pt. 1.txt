Reyna do mean the nume must drink a cow
that's your new meme and go work with it
let's start this
Deus Ex didn't get sucky I just I've
been playing it for awhile I needed to
do something else needed to do some
elephant 300 years fighting for the
order
I've killed thousands of orcs and
defended dozens of rifts and this is how
it ends
one slip and a kobolds blood and my
skull cracks open on the gatehouse steps
so now the task of defending this
fortress falls to my apprentice
that's it then
the world is doomed it's all up to me
now alright rest well crazy old man the
sting things first let's see what he
left me in this spell book and I highly
recommend this game's better than the
sequels so if you want to like skip it
and get the sequels I actually like this
more
and mines all fucked up
that's fine networks
fines ago
there's an early level don't have much
to work with it one lock traps game
audio don't ya
that means all tabular which is
dangerous
DLC is over power I will attempt I will
attempt to not use it oh no no no it
works crash that's that's fine that's
fine as long as the stream didn't crash
is the stream still a stream yes the
stream is still stream reopened orcs
now is it too quiet yes that's right go
drink account
it's you know player name is fine it's
fine
there we go I've spent three
I've killed thousands of orcs and
defended dozens of reference and this is
how it ends one slip and a kobolds blood
and my skull cracks open on the
gatehouse
steps so now the task of defending this
fortress falls to my apprentice
that's it then the world is doomed it's
all up to me now rest well crazy old man
first things first let's see what he
left me in this spell book alright
so I I have none of the DLC items
selected and obviously this first stage
it's gonna be pretty damn simple and
this is the trainer stage the beginner
stage so I got some spike traps down on
the ground and they just run past those
and they're gonna get I gotta get spiked
pork the other others whitening
this first page is just it's too fucking
easy but it's basically it's the
tutorial stage got the tar trap they
might not even make to it they just
slows them down
all right so these orcs are storming in
right and what we're trying to prevent
is the orcs are racing towards that
thing the rift which is basically the
gateway to earth and once they're there
they will wreak havoc probably lots of
work rape which I can't imagine is none
too Pleasant
how about some of this
yes once they reached reached the rafter
Warcraft happens actually might have my
mouse sensivity set a little bit too
high
let's go down there
I think my head quality gaming mouses
just throwing this game for a loop
too easy too damn easy
five skull now love that victory music
all right that bad not a bad stud
all right so every every every every
level you get either a you know a new
toy a new inventory slot so we're gonna
we're gonna expand our arsenal and we're
trying not to use some of the DLC items
I'm gonna eventually because some of
them are fun honestly actually should
I'm for now we're good
forget what store they come out of first
I think it's this one
some new decorations
right as this morning
and your traps can't hurt you
fortunately
it'll hurt a lot
so easy too easy all right I'm gonna
trap the left here and focus on the
right with on with our weaponry
oh it's not dead yet
some little decorations
step right this way mr. borke
oh yeah
yes I am streaming as is obvious by the
fact that I am clearly streaming
washing video right I'm not saying that
because the screen went black again I
hope I hope you're seeing the actual
game because what a pathetic thing would
be like black screen and me barely
talking cuz it's the solo stream that
would just be the worst yes the bubbling
tar just slows them down which honestly
extremely goddamn useful so useful it's
gonna be the first damn thing I upgrade
which makes them even slower these
skulls yarn like I'm getting five skulls
that means I did perfect cuz you know
I'm perfect that those those are what
you spend like if I had did a half-ass
job and I got three skulls I'd have less
funding to upgrade traps
another day another fortress another
rift to defend they always seem to break
through the doors we should do something
about that
all right I would love to but I'm not
gonna
considering busting out the DLC items
right now I'm good a stream works for a
bit and then I'm done I don't know how
long I'm gonna be see how this goes
we'll see how this goes
step right this way mr. Roarke I like
this one
could have done a lot better
I'm gonna heal bit there we go
kind of love the acid
just for you
who wants more traps I do I do
where my damn it
archers must have got it
easy easy
what's this game always like this what
what other way did you you think this
game was like Jay X right
did you think it used to be a fighting
game what's what seems different
there's rending I have there one upgrade
now I'll save it
now as this game has always been more
tower-defense it's not really dungeon
master
den I want that fucking wind belt
putting a lot of those down those and
those and no that's it I'm still not
using DLC items I'm I'm going to at some
point
that's gonna leave a mark
it'll hurt a lot
that's wasted my Wauwatosa let's get one
guy with it yeah
alright next we're just gonna carpet
this entire fucking area
that's gonna leave a mark
I'm not talking much slang works
I need some help we got a four combo in
one of those York traps and work is
affected by then you get a higher combo
we just need
nice
all right
nope still saving it
saving it for the archers
pick up my poisons here now a lot of
times I use this here just for fun fuck
it you know what fuck it it's a fun item
I'm gonna use it
gentlemen move up a little bit further
no you're not gonna do that all right
fine fuck off just just fuck right off
greeting cycle
let's see some oh penis at work
very Opie but fun
something for your face yeah we need
some health
god I hate those things
who
that's gonna leave a mark
all right yonder yonder says cuz you
said let's see some what that's it cuz
you said let's see some oh penis at work
and now I have that song stuck in my
head thank you you're welcome
you're very welcome umm what was he
doing oh yes Archer sold the tarp trap
to get an extra Archer prioritizing
offenses what I'm doing
not bad I'll take that
fucking rats little fricken rats is what
they have going on here
like it
look
not bad not bad
our kobolds an actual mythological thing
I thought they were just kind of
invented for this game honestly
you call yourself a fucking a nerd I'm
not a D&D; nerd I have nothing against
D&D; but I'm not a D&D; nerd I think I got
a PO kyun thing going on that's just not
a bad guy like space
I've got to bring my Thord I like my
sword
oh wait
that's gonna leave a mark
yonder yonder says our kobolds real go
read a fucking monster manual you bitch
wow-wow know there will be a stream
tomorrow this is rich Evans bonus thing
because I love you all so much forever
and ever
always and always
Oh
that was easy
oh that was a nasty way it wasn't that
hell fuck
all right then I'm gonna got through yet
that's a good thing here that closer
closer my archers not gonna take care of
that guy there we go
yes they are just talking honestly
longer initiative
honestly I expect more out of those guys
and they let me down
this all hurt
perfect perfect
things are going swell
all right whoo very one of those kobolds
really get through
all right barricades 12 I'm at 8
one more good mission and I can upgrade
that shit the ever underrated
spring-trap god bless it
Oh God I'm glad I didn't out start lying
down traps I could have been very bad
only grabbing the one would have been
devastating
how about some of this
or the other other white meat
retreat
last thing you'll ever see
knock it down
I don't believe in it like that I don't
think the trap will destroy the
barricade I hope not then I'm fucked I'm
sorry I'm scratch my nose I'm fucked up
my mouth
set it and forget it
this won't hurt
okay over here
oh alright alright
stage is being trickier than it feels
like it should be I don't know if I
fucked something up or what
do you hope nobody gets hurt
good they're not make it past the
springs even great
that's site is good
and your face
oh that won't close that one got really
close really close how's everyone doing
out there and rich Evans this shitty
solo streams land oh man moving on buy
upgrades cheaper fucking barricades yes
please wall blades alright
what do I need here
I once asked the old man what would
happen
the rifts in our
got all clear step out into there
shatter eddsworld beyond the fortress
gates and you will know
oh yeah good I just said it'd be bad
Wow
it's expensive
feels inadequate
whoo oh yeah
lright sorry I'm being so quiet just
phase of the game a lot of a
concentration kill them fucking orcs
nice
whoo yeah yeah love that level love that
level all right don't really have
anything to upgrade ah continue one okay
yonder yonder says more rich heavens
victory screams equal more tips thank
you thank you I will be sure to have
more victories so that I can victory
screen for you rich how difficult is
this game um it's one of those games
that you can master which i think is a
fun thing
starting off you'll hit like a level
like that where you got to defend like
two entirely different different
doorways and this is not really a great
choke point and you feel like oh shit
I'm never gonna do it but eventually you
just get good you get better at the game
and when you get better at the game it
gets easier like like a good game like
like a very good game last level is kind
of hard there's a few hard levels but I
mean once you once you find a good setup
you can deal with anything and one of
the things I like about this game like
there's no one right way to set up a
series of traps like I've seen videos of
you on YouTube where people like set up
for whatever particular level like an
entirely different way than I do and
that's great all right
Aniki to continuous steam trap eyes
fucking thing which is for my for my
purposes useless its I understand it can
be good to set up combos like you can
use the steam trap that'll push them up
and to like a thing on the wall that
will smash them somewhere else but I
don't I don't go for high-score
so much as I do just slaughter
it's like they're filling my head
all right sword because I always bring
my Thord a lot of people don't even use
the Thord like thorns so I bring my
Thord arrows good I'm gonna bring the
vampire gloves it's DLC weapon but fuck
it I like the vampire gloves don't know
shit about the masquerade fuck off
I definitely those here definitely those
and differently those and that's all I
need that's all I'm going to need
I like this one
fuck fuck fuck
then I was wet bad really almost went
bad this is where they come for the
other door I don't think so
oh I hate these things so much they die
this doesn't seem fair
oh yeah
a little present for you
hey those arches alone new arches
we other white meat
oh here's a good one
Oh
get the fuck out of there you fucker
pairing up that was not good
whoo
another five skull effort doing great
alright what did I want to upgrade yeah
my name's maybe I don't think I use that
often enough I'm gonna hold off whoo
the rumor is a lot of us war mages are
falling in battle
wonder how many are left to hold the
forks
all right
that's gonna leave a mark
No
Oh
I'm so clever sorry I'm so quiet
poof it'll hurt a lot
last wave good
whoo yeah there you go any chance I'll
play the multiplayer sequel with Jack oh
my god
I can't imagine Jack playing this for
the first time we had a stream of it you
know what it might be amazing I'm gonna
have to talk him into it game ogre
disciplined daddy I like that one you
get you get 200 Internet bucks
what's upcoming that I might rather
upgrade not I'm not sure I'm trying to
remember what's coming up and I don't
if you want some internet box say
something say something fucking clever
that makes me go yeah it was great then
you get Internet bucks I I run the
internet buck mint and are not supposed
to just be giving them to people but
whatever I'm corrupted rich have you
bought anything yet no one in in my my
many decades of life I have never
purchased a single thing what are you
talking about like in game in game I got
the tard trap upgrade which slows
enemies down even more
I bought the archer upgrade which makes
archers cheaper which is good and I got
the barricade upgrade which makes
barricades cheaper and oh wait I might
want to save up for brimstone I don't
remember what I'm getting that exactly
but I damn well know I want to afford it
when I get it
okay so we're continuing on I'm not
buying anything at this moment oh I get
the weavers I was a lousy teacher but he
was the worst kind of student dim-witted
foolish and too stubborn to focus on the
fundamentals that's why the order paired
us up they sent their best and brightest
to learn from other more patient warm
ages I got the bottom of the barrel
the joke's on them those brilliant young
minds are dead along with most of their
masters slaughtered trying to defend the
riffs the world is still doomed of
course there aren't enough war majors
left now though I laugh if the last one
left standing is him I have a I have a
fan theory about this game
we are the the incompetence apprentice
and yet despite all of the the highly
trained and powerful wizards that were
in the order we end up being the last
one standing and and my theory is that
our main characters stupidity is
actually what what lets him win I think
the other mages like rely on like their
the fire spell and their there's skill
spells whereas our our stupid war mage
relies on these like goofy Rube Goldberg
II and traps like spring things on the
ground that launch orcs into the wall
and I think other wizards they probably
took a look at these traps and said
these are these are idiotic like like
like the orcs they're gonna they're
gonna see that that grinder on the wall
and they're gonna see there buddy ahead
of them get sucked into it they're not
gonna be dumb enough to run into that
and the other war mages underestimated
the stupidity of the orcs to just walk
into the Rube Goldberg II and traps
whereas our war mage was too stupid to
think that would be an issue that's my
theory make of it what you will
kind of yes to defeat an orc you have to
think like an orc
doctor so neighs you're probably right
just he's the most incompetent and worse
because that makes the story more
interesting yes
but I'm fond of my theory all right wish
which one is this ah this one all right
I got a sword take my wind belt I'll
take my vampire gauntlets take my
archers take my charm
I'll take the push traps cuz the cheap
what else do I want barricades will do
me no good here tar right I got the tar
already what else do I want
Walsh raps
and then we had the weavers now
the weavers let you they reset every
every match every round every round
every every level and they let you
upgrade various things the steel Weaver
there's like a focus on traps and
Guardians like orcs go bi transgender
866 monk coins guardians have increased
health Guardians have flaming arrows
like that kind of thing then the
elemental Weaver upgrades like you like
it upgrade you side to the holy son
upgrade your crossbow to fire crossbow
and you do spells better and the way
this one's set up there's there's two
different entrances and ones the higher
and ones lower and I'm gonna set traps
and Guardians to defend one and then I'm
gonna use the elemental Weaver make
myself more powerful and I will
personally defend the other rift the
other gate
so she pushed traps
yeah for now just that
burnin orcs mommy
here's a good one
which we're total they break out of
first is what I don't remember that the
upper one
now slow I want
no you don't know you don't god I hate
those fucking things
put the
springtrap's up here but there's
actually a horrible chance they'll just
fall down over the level below and get
into the rift it might actually spring
them all the way over there I think if I
had the actual floor spring traps I got
to be careful doing that I should have
done that
nobody
let's do it again
all right
Tom and archers that's what it's all
about
this won't hurt a bit
lots of fucking archers
nothing coming up in the higher end
doesn't look like
terrified something I don't know that's
gonna come out the top gate and I think
I'm safe now
that's gonna leave a mark
what do you got what do you got kobolds
yep
burn baby burn
another down another down
up top
check my archers
all right did anything get through
doesn't look like it
yeah
insurance
the little present for you
is your initiative
I hear them I gotta get up top I think
damn ads oh well oh well probably a
fucking kobold wasn't it
for schools
well damn no wow they're that fucking
blew it good look I think I got a least
safely say I'm good though I can get
better
fucking fire yes I want fucking fire
I can't blow up my bear okay it's Canada
maybe I can that's the case then getting
that is really stupid
for how the setup works
just for you
that's gonna leave a mark
what have you got
you made the right decision
not that way
excellent
right well this one's going well
yeah you know what I think I need to
damage over time what I need is a
shitload of fuckin archers that's what I
need a metric fucking shit ton of
archers
archers until I run out of places to put
them
that'll at least
five x combo I'll take that shit nope
Marsha's you're killing them too fast
I'm not getting any combos oh it's
glorious though I'll give it that much
holy fuck they're not even getting close
hmm kill them all
a little present for you one for you and
one for you yeah I don't need it read
any of this shit
I'll get that because here we're not you
know I met the limit of shit I need
it's fucking slaughter
it was beautiful for exes
kind of makes up for the last one
kind of
probably way more than enough for the
brimstone but we're gonna continue on
get bent I love you too
super head if superheroes had superpower
and well people had superpowers if there
were superheroes
some of them would kill some of them
would not kill your superpower might
make it way too easy to kill
so now the order sent me to the
fortresses on the western line
it's a dangerous region but I laugh at
danger and at kittens just so cute
all right when won't do me anything acid
could I'm trying to avoid the DLC stuff
but fucking I'm gonna use these anyway
late
there's a lot to learn
let's get started come back when you
arrest
all right which door do they come out of
you
nice
I know
come back when you're ready
oh here's a good one
whoo yes burning pitch give it to me
yes this is like the orcs home dimension
they're trying to get birth one did
because I failed at my job that's just
the brutal truth
they almost got your heart where's the
no no there doesn't
in the room okay got no room where's the
green portal Paris
I don't know if I have to do anything
Oh where am I
nice nice
nice alright
nice ice
what are we got coming at me oh that's
right we got this little thing that says
what we have coming I know I want that
ice ice ice baby
archers dummy barricades here thar
all bumpers jumpers Cooper's ball tubers
I'll call them all troopers
I know I didn't imagine that voice
whoever she is I don't think she liked I
don't understand how can anyone not like
me
hey gonna get a little help oh do I want
her
he use a lot of ice but I'm also gonna
use a lot of guardians probably better
off in guardians
decisive I like that
but I need more spells first what do I
want I think that's all I need really
for the stage but it's kind of dumb not
to use extra traps lots already got the
turn I'm not gonna use those pounders
I need a good spot to use those damn it
I think I'm good
yeah
yeah I got my trusty sword
never go anywhere without my trusty
sword students change the screen yeah I
can't
nope
our orcs inherently evil I think they're
just inherently violent
hey lady save the flirting I'm trying to
kill orcs here
I suppose I expected this
should've gone all mental
this
that's a lot of fucking hell baths
something for your face
no I hate those fucking things
traps kill them I'll get more I'll get
more got a big patient out of a patient
and I patient enough
go then see you back
shit I'm over the elemental it's that is
doing me a lot of wood do me a lot of
favors if I was freaking using it
run run run run run run run run
I suppose I expected this
give pleasure
all right
playing dangerous playing danger should
not have been doing that
yeah what all the trouble of upgrading
my guardians and may as well buy archers
with the extra cash why not why not
oh shit didn't have enough magic that
could have gone badly Dingle badly could
have gone worse could have died
the stream is too entertaining I've said
jack shit I guess the game's just good
that's fine you know what let the game
do all the work for once
this just doesn't seem fair
nice
yes murder
right there's a nearly perfect run very
nearly can't win them all
now I get my brimstone alright I should
have enough to upgrade it
so what do I know so far
orcs ogres and nulls all working
together
creepy boys talking in my head and I
can't get in touch with the other war
majors it all spells bad for the Capitol
beat and the Capitol a
got to have that ice
can you imagine if a sleazy or publisher
handled this game hello Mike returns
actions and paid to win I hate to break
this to you but the third game Orcs Must
Die Unchained I have heard I haven't
played it myself I've heard that's what
they've turned it into I'm sorry I'm
very sorry
until later I suppose
this won't hurt
here's a good one
present for you one for you and one for
you
it's gonna hurt my time but better safe
than sorry
which button do I have that bounty
dammit I don't remember
the other whitening
yeah
try this on for size
is that all
oh the fucking Kobo get through fuck me
it's gonna hurt me more than it hurts
you no way all the way around
kobolds are ruining my day I'll tell you
that
I know that seems strange to put those
there but that that will make sense
you might not see it makes sense it
makes sense there's a thing with ogres
like me
I'm pretty well protected against ogres
right now are you talking about like in
real life yeah that'd be pretty bad
or for that one fucking cobalt they got
there I'd be killing it
there's aren't over stuck in a loop yeah
that's wrong wrong weapon wrong weapon
wrong weapon
see it say that push trap bring me over
down here lands into that one goes back
into the other ones and then into the
lava this is one I get the second one
but I prefer the first one
yes oh this one oh joy oh joy
I'll be back in a bit I gotta do
something
one second I'll be I'll be back shortly
I am on the phone with Karen
all right hi and kind of back FYI full
disclosure here I got a time limit now a
half an hour and currently I'm eating
lunch well dinner you always ask so it's
chicken with pasta and vegetables yes I
have replaced the silence that I created
the silences were going out all damn
stream how can we be shocked by this
kind of pasta and I'll kind of spirally
kind of doodads what do you call the
spirally ones 30 minutes I got to go
meet up with Karen
so I cut some broccoli some carrots and
some corn in here Jesus Christ
like I've been good never what happened
is dreaming since time was a 232 extreme
reasons about to
it's about a six hour stream I've done
my due diligence but better vegetables
and broccoli is this shit
yeah my I ate all right fine
we'll finish up this level I don't see
how we're doing on time maybe the next
then I got to take off
I'm here Christ should be watching the
fucking movie or something now they
listening to me eat
well in theory something can be the
first film to use cameras if you count
like that one kind of famous thing with
a horse there's like a very early kind
of film of a horse running and I think
that was done with just a bunch of
single image cameras all going off one
after the other I could be wrong about
that
which I have heard was recorded in order
for somebody to win a bet about whether
or not all of the horses legs were ever
off the ground when a horse is running
chunks of chicken are huge
when crack aimed in it
hurry up I hope yep
I'm zoom game library I hate this one
there's what we got though
all right let's do this I hate this map
a lot of times this is the first map I
owe a first map I take a loss on but I
fucked up early today real early so I
got these two damn gates and I think
they come out of this one first whoa did
I just crash did the stream just crash
no it looks like streaming all right
got laughs let's take my Thord on ice or
fire or both
take ice and fire definitely want that
you want this
that
guardians Ashley I know the last thing I
want release
what have you got Hey
right
sometimes I almost feel bad for the orcs
except not really no not enough money
not enough
I'll still like to go back I can't get
that brimstone huh fucking it's great
well define everything's great
nice choice hotshot
you won't be sorry
I may have been a made a big mistake I
didn't forget to bring brimstone but
nothing I could do about that now
hurry up rip prick
Miriam
fuck
we're awake turn around you fucker
yeah that was too intense
did you see the spring-trap flying right
up into the mace that was perfect and
unplanned I just read I would put him on
the other side I didn't figure it would
throw up into the mace that's the
coolest thing ever
this'll hurt step right this way mr.
Roarke
don't waste what I've given
at this point we just largely watch them
run into the traps
that was close
happy hunting
archers because they can shoot it at my
archers so
kobolds fast enough to get through my
traps before dying before the base comes
back sorry thinking can't talk thinking
all right we're essentially on the rails
right now
that's gonna leave a mark
and I'd rather just have more call yes
what what who got through who fucking
got through bullshit robbed bullshit
robbed robbed bullshit March is too
fucking stupid to shooter the kobolds
mother fucker well fuck me
ah
I'm not trying to break a score I'm just
trying to do as good as I can cuz well
you do when you play a game
there's before I bought that god damn it
and I'm so happy I sniped that one
right now this one
all right applicants
fire shit so I don't really want ice
you know my Guardians when Springs a
couple barricades I don't think there's
gonna be a swinging mace trap for this
one I don't know there's a good place to
put one
I mean I got to bring it
yes if you have a bad trap plan it gets
very hard
you know there's lots of lava pits in
this one oh my brimstone Oh sir
a spot for my sealing traps no why don't
give domes there's like no fucking place
I can put my here though I don't know
that I plan on using it anyway
there's a lot to learn let's get started
until later I suppose okay
I don't remember which doors they come
out of when for this map I just don't
recall
that's gonna leave a mark
when I have that brimstone they're gonna
put these back a bit further
also we want Guardian jet
look about that bolt you know fuck
around
oh I forgot to barricade off one of the
pants well that's dumb
I'm gonna have a hard time here cuz I
fucked up big time
big time
oh wow that nearly cost me
Oh nope wrong way fix it later
this won't hurt a bit
that's where they Oh
go then see if I care
it'll hurt a lot
oh fuck I forgot archers I didn't forget
I just thought I could wait a bit
it's gonna be bad so bad
yeah fuck
not doing it so great not doing so great
my rust is showing
a lot
yeah
look

just falling apart here
I cannot do it to install here
how did the spring-trap now get oh did I
not get the over upgrade thought I got
the ogre upgrade fuck me
that'll suck
oh did I buy the wrong one I suppose I
expected this think I brought that one
with him yeah it's fine it's fine
yeah that's fun stuff yay violence
Oh fuck's sake
alright alright it's it okay I did Oh
cash I'd love to see this to the end but
I got stuffs that needed oozed and stuff
I don't know I know what I'm saying
orcs can fly down there orcs up in those
elk OSes cuz the spring traps flung them
up there comically but they don't die
