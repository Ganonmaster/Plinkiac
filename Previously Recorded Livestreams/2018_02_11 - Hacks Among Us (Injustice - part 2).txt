hi counselor of Diana's new look look we
have a boobs you see I ran into Diana's
twin and someone who looked a lot like
Oliver Queen and Hal Jordan
find them and any others that might be
out there I want to know everything
that's in daily from adventures
yeah yeah it sounds like the other one
sounded like him I saw I assumed
thanks for the ride you're a funny guy
are you sure the old gang lives around
here true yeah they could be dead Oh
Laura biting bite your tongue
he's terrible yes bad sugar yeah he
sounds like someone trying to do a Mark
Hamill impression and not being really
great at it it's George and Newbern the
other voice of animated Risty my fame
precedes me
oh I'm Joker now oh my god shit I wasn't
prepared for I've got enough I thought I
was there are they getting Oh neat okay
how about this one oh I did that one are
figuring out all my Joker moves here how
about this plucky Heath hey speaking of
huh aah ha ha ha Batman and Superman huh
huh awkwardly punching each other
aah have you watched Oh movie Bob's epic
the part Batman vs. Superman huh review
yes
okay I understood some of that yeah
there was a there's a like a three
fuckin children grabbed him thinking oh
that was nice
there there's like a damn it Batman I'm
gonna lose this bone but that's okay
because I'm just learning much over this
how about this pie to the face yeah good
okay I mean I'm definitely losing this
one that's okay
yeah there's it's like a three-hour
dissection of Batman vs Superman I bet
you could totally kick somebody through
that front oh you can I want to say
right oh I want to see Joker do that
specifically because it makes absolutely
no sense right to use super strength to
knock back after a truck you have to do
it now I'm on that side so now I can all
right how about alright settle bit okay
all right I'm trying
okay
there we go
okay I guess you could argue that the
explosion tanker doesn't yeah okay I'll
take it
I don't think Joker is yet the this
Joker in Batman aren't from this
universe so it's like a Batman your
super dupe didn't hit me what does the
Jovi do when he hit B I don't know oh
it's not ready it slashes it's night
nope
yeah the choker should not be that
strong right Joe Kirby is a Perry okay
okay that's fair Oh - Bob's do-rag says
hey guys I just rewind forager for the
first time and realized how much of a
missed opportunity it was yes apart from
the concept itself what was voyagers
biggest missed opportunity yeah
so many the okay the biggest missed
opportunity is Janeway as Captain
such a beautiful moment can't be rushed
don't go cheering up without me had a
fantastic actress could have could have
had another incredible memorable let's
go
I don't think so hard without my camera
doomsday has a mohawk yeah right
yeah boys your headlights one episode
you guest stars like multicam you want
episode guest stars you just wish they
were part of the main crew okay that's
better
there's a problem when you're when
you're guest stars or better characters
yeah well you just got a lot of a lot of
world problems that stack up I can't I
can't sum it up as this is the one thing
a little bird told me some creep was
dressed up like the Joker fighting a
Batman wannabe you got the look and a
lot of nerve what you don't have is the
right Joker was a hero you're not fit to
lick his boutonniere Harley it's me I'm
the Joker
look it says so right here on my
underwear I have to beat up Harley I'm
sorry
okay this net and that okay all right
everything's fine
shoot in the face again who that Perry
is actually really awesome
Hugh chases fellow nerves have you heard
of freeware Star Trek walking sim your
stage 9 B is for our number of rooms on
these 1701 D it's a pre-alpha and
unstable but fun I have not heard of it
I've seen a number of things that did
stuff like that like there was a doom
level that was a recreation of the
interval yeah way back in the day they
did it in Minecraft they did the
enterprise like you're getting shout the
head that would be enough
take out Harley brother but yeah
Kevin Smith named his kid Harley Quinn
Smith so he named his child after a
woman who was a victim of domestic abuse
yeah it's the love you could feel the
love right Joker's dead but sure this
isn't my Gotham but I am The Joker my
dear my you're Joker Harley it's like
her acting like that doesn't make any
sense with that outfit yeah you know
like that is the innocent outfit
yeah that's a that's a hard-ass outfit
she has knives and leather and stuff
like that just doesn't work together
it's visual dissonance
what the fuck outfit is everybody
everybody hey Forrest
goddamn it Harley's only ever good when
she's away from the Joker watch the
animated series man nice workout he's
not him what his DNA matches Bruce
Wayne's but his vitals are all wrong
you're one of the duplicates
tell me why you're here love what you've
done with the place
Arkham is never looked better dear
members of the Joker clan you know the
truth the charity promised incident
Superman killed those people then he
tried to kill me
I admire the work you've done in my name
disturbances destructions general pains
and Superman's buttocks but let's think
bigger
he's terribly yeah he's a terrible voice
I'll eat - you know you gotta find it
you gotta find your own thing
snugs boys and Sergio's got some can't
just imitate what we have them - with
these a bus could fall on us and we
won't be hurt slapstick and its finest
from now on we'll be more than a
nuisance the barking dog' will become
the rampaging elephants do whoopee
cushion a landmine the Joker
Oh evil Nightwing looks
yeah that's great I'm going to enjoy
giving you all right
gum the guard says right game TBS even
shows it for eSports sequel has the TMNT
question about craft American cheese
it's terrible isn't it the best thing
for pigs-in-a-blanket
enjoying now also DC Universe Online ps4
cream cheese cheese Kraft singles are oh
now this that's cheese
craft is damn good the grilled cheese
sandwich says somebody who has probably
never gone to a deli and got some good
proper Land O'Lakes American cheese it
is so much better it's laughable you
know I'm not so much better not saying
that those grilled cheeses are bad I'm
just lucky
try American cheese get Land O'Lakes
spine brand Land O'Lakes cheese from a
deli so much better than Kraft I say
Land O'Lakes because I know that's
reliable it's probably better out there
Hey
Oh trying to hit the right button thing
it didn't work
everything's fine man with me says
thanks for playing injustice here is a
tip hoping you will play injustice two
characters look much much they can only
go up from here
I've seen I've seen a little bit of on
the youtubes it does look it does look
considerably better originally that's
not that's not too shocking oh look it's
here
okay hey Joker's died here so the bat
brat joins Superman tell me whose boots
are tastier to lick Batman's a criminal
just like you nothing like me so you're
a hero where you come from oh no dear
boy
it's just that Batman corrupts young
minds while I bash them out of their
skulls it I wanted to use the counter
more maybe you maybe don't write me
maybe I should just oh yeah just stick
to one another stickers Oh Oh God Jesus
Christ

learning keeping them off their bounds
so they stopped blocking my damn super

you can turn that off now thanks for
showing up so fast bats hi gang what do
we do now anyone up for pancakes
pancakes what are you playing at Harleen
what's he doing here mr. J can be a big
help to us so you came along on our
little field trip and I'm guessing he
didn't arrive alone a really neat thing
happened when I knocked and through our
come here he got beat up by Killer Croc
the penguin and the Riddler in a
different room Oh Batman quiet or I'll
cuff you and leave you for the police
and why did you save me from them Oh
Batman's been captured we got to bust
him out to free your Batman we need to
complete our mission
negative you and your clan lay low
negative and you're too dangerous to run
free more of them will be here soon go
I'll catch up with you I feel like he's
not giving at all or you know yeah
the or or whatever voice he's doing for
this Batman we don't we pull him here no
good it's just the face same problem you
can't take a Batman who looks like that
seriously this is wearing it so far as
my cosmic treadmill pull them all back
at once we got some work to do
beautiful isn't the moon or it's light
shining off your bald head
I'm pleased you wanted to meet you're
finally ready to join our little Club
business is bad being hunters wars after
so many refusals why now person
then they made it personal right how
they make it personal now
must have been some party Superman did
this exposed my identity and froze all
waynetech assets made Bruce Wayne an odd
person I still can't believe he lost at
this bat even with what Joker did in
Superman's mind
he destroyed metropolis I'm not
following somehow Joker altered
Superman's mind so we believed he was
fighting doomsday but it was Louis knew
Joker linked the nukes trigger to Louis
his heartbeat and she and the baby died
metropolis died with them Superman was
vulnerable probably for the first time
in his life his fear one out Green Arrow
died man beat the shit out of love as
Ryan was doomed
that was some beat by the way classic
joke you're with me you three secure the
bat cave entrance it's in a study that's
a great plan spooky but isn't this your
show splitting up saves time and you're
best suited to take out the automated
sentry guns all right then
operation Thunder Eagle lightning
whatever is under way
okay great
we're doing great these graphics are so
bad yeah uh how old is this game though
Oh old you know comparatively it's yeah
this is old enough seven years maybe
twenty thirteen five five and it's 1980
storm oh they did they just ripped off
that look
it was a little elbow scoob's just need
to come back up
headbutt from solomon grundy so green
arrow is dead
yeah his skull was caved in and he's
fighting this in his last grows his mine
did he have a super suit oh sure why not
everyone did oh wait I think he actually
he did I think that man okay shoot
Grundy oh my god I have to
okay okay okay okay
do a knife on my bow and arrow yes
nope that didn't do what I wanted it to
do
how about this okay oh wow Sami how
about what did i do what did i do what
did i do everything everything wrong
stop firing arrows up into the air
that's not helping Oliver out something
Grady's kicking my ass strength means
nothing in this universe how how would
you handle a a fighting game that has a
green arrow going up against Sullivan
Grundy right and have it be it all
balanced right no piano
what he ripped a tombstone out of his
belly
you see cuz he's a zombie cuz he's a
zombie
decide now no nope not what I wanted to
do shit stop it stop it Salman gritty
gonna do it oh fuck
what is Solomon Grundy's comic-book
power level I thought he was one of the
heavier hitters yeah and like not like
Hulk level but you know yeah maybe uh at
least Bane levels like you think real
superpower level time veins just to do
it in steroids the really good steroids
yeah
but I thought I thought brendi was the
kind of guy who like you know toss a
semi only oh maybe by I could I could
easily be wrong to me here yeah that's
what I wanted to do go into the TV it's
killer famous killer frost yeah
she's a nice feeling arrows oh shoot how
do i just shoot an arrow that's all i
wanted to do it like i haven't figured
out how to shoot an arrow straight yet
and I know that that seemed that might
seem like petty but doesn't work like
the back of the battery I have no idea
turn to the back forward why
Oh God oh Jesus Christ
oh that's great back forward or down
forward down for to come up
B is for arrange somebody sign by the
way totally fair totally fair I lost
again man I had full soup to do if I was
about to use my soup to do I think I can
choose different arrows to
how long is the story mode to this game
this is something we can expect the
hammer out in a night I don't know I
like we're a couple hours in right and
we're like we're barely scratching the
rösti the surface here weightless in
orbit you didn't Grundy's a zombie
you'll be fine
yep let's go it won't be long before
Superman knows we're here solid 60 hours
you know so you need some sort of
scanner to help identify these
duplicates exactly you can beat it or if
you don't know Anna strikers I probably
lost a couple times that's helpful
it's Chapter five of how many you'll
figure it out you always do
glad to be of service no dinner this
evening
Stefan has a new shipment of that Kansas
beef next time
these duplicates
do you think there's a Louis where they
come from there was only one of those
you his face you flat out growing a
beard again I don't know should be yeah
I have it now right yeah like we're
getting we're getting close and I
haven't freaked out yet and I know drove
you nuts last time you did oh and I'm
it's a little happen again no like like
I said what was it like a couple weeks
ago I know last week I just needed to
get out of the house thing I needed to
shave the top of my head but I didn't
have time for the full drama so just
shave this clean this up I mean I kept
it I haven't shaved since yeah we'll see
what happens I'll probably shave
tomorrow all I could so I put the weapon
in a wolf it only opens my spot I don't
know if I'll shave the beard or else try
to stick it out again and then lose my
marbles as soon as it starts itching and
I get chameleon it again like I always
do okay
twelve chapters overall you are in the
middle of chapter 5 minder
yeah it's like that just seems noisier
that one but Rach you're gonna throw a
rock at Superman
mm-hmm
hands on the scanners oh that's clever
that's why he needs a little computer
begin recognition scam why do they need
the rock what I get it so he needs these
specific members of the Justice League
to unlock what I assume is kryptonite to
kill Superman yeah and so that's why he
had to bring them over from the other
world that's cute
we fight now zip would you let your
guard down at your peril who did Black
Adam except like Adam nope
our green arrow was just as arrogant and
probably just as handsome also dead
because he's fighting a god oh that
worked just to be fair I think he is
dead
Green Arrow yeah yeah he's died a couple
times I think like that she didn't like
that
I didn't fly in the be single trees did
she know she's there wait did she and
Justice League trying to remember I
don't remember I don't think I don't
think she did I think you might be right
I don't think she did yeah
what thing no but she can fly well in
the movie I don't know that she does
know I mean in in DC Canon
I think but DC Canon changes every few
weeks right so I don't know we'll talk
about the new 52 the only 52 right next
year's 52 the 5200 53 oh yeah that's the
continuity I'm talking about pre-crisis
pose crisis 350 to push 50 to post new
52 52 free post new flashpoint 52 that's
a good one 52 point 62 points that's an
interesting story with Cod rebirth flash
rebirth uh-huh what flash rebirth 52
yeah most flash rebirth 52 that was the
weird one that's enough
pull the hey get a joke should have seen
that coming only one of you remains yeah
but I'm the one to beat
fired senses and justice is fun in
schlocky
and I like the idea of a Superman having
a breakdown
Richard Jack did either of you ever get
to watch Logan I've not only not seen
Logan yeah I've seen you didn't care for
I didn't care I mean a lot of it's fine
again that was one of those like where I
just like the hype was built up so much
of that that's like it was fine I did
not overly care for it
I didn't like the ending I just want to
knock them closer to the wall so I can
do this bit you know come over here come
over here you won't do it Stan I want to
I want to throw you through the wall
could you come over here please
oh I love them everything Jack please
stop jumping randomly it's all part of
my process
damn can it be fixed the kryptonite's
intact but the optical resonator was
beyond repair
even with luthor we don't have the
resources to build a new one quickly
looks like we're gonna need some help
my favorite superhero movies uh yeah I
just I I thought of a lot of missed
opportunities I didn't much care for I
don't know the no role I guess I didn't
I didn't like his lack of character arc
and I know that was kind of like the
point is like he doesn't have a
character arc but I and I felt like the
fighting the younger version of himself
was a little lame
all right let's crank it up yeah who's
fine a lot of the action sequences were
really cool
nope nope you don't oh do I get to be
cyborg yeah let me be cyborg don't know
whether to Pat myself on the back kick
myself cuz they don't know you said this
place was secure just keep him busy with
pleasure
yeah I guess I'm ordinal help shit
Deathstroke's gonna do nothing but get
us ask us so far yeah
now out what I did there oh my god this
was that did I do that now
hey-hey-hey-hey go how about that I like
that Deathstroke didn't like that at all
he likes it just every is fine
everything's fine I don't know what you
talking about I did you brought a soupy
dupe to a gunfight
apparently that was the wrong call
no stopping with the gun there I got a
gun too you like that
no you don't it's not nice is it tasing
the balls this alright do it again
I wasn't trying to actually that time
but you know here we are booyah Kingdom
threatened
nope oh oh and that's not gonna kick him
through it I want to kick him through it
I don't think you can it looks like you
can right
it looks like it but I guess you can't I
don't have anything to wager did
Deathstroke at home for them oh I should
move it from something right not every
stage has the field of defense it should
how about that I'll grant you that
yeah pleasures all mine Slade it's it's
weird seeing him look like that but
hearing that voice cuz that's the same
voice for like the super cartoony Teen
Titan my goers cyborg okay so it's very
weird to hear that voice but see him
look realistic
I was the same voice yeah the blue prism
says peace brothers rich your stream
last Friday / Saturday thank you
weapons hot
what what does that mean okay you didn't
like that he doesn't like
hope that's fair no that's fair
was be due for cyber oh yeah I don't
really know he does this maybe it makes
him stronger
eat it legs
help now yes
that's great battle wardrobe malfunction
Oh for those for those of you who didn't
hear it the quip at the end of the fight
was a wardrobe malfunction that works in
context that that's a dated reference at
this point at the time at the time it
might have been funny but why would you
just stick your hand in there you idiot
it's kind of its ramp up your
transporter fix the laser in our
dimension and come back with
reinforcements
I'm sure I can get there's no time five
years ago a tragic event cost the lives
of millions overwhelmed by guilt for the
part he played in the destruction he was
driven mad he became an agent of chaos
an enemy of peace and security but no
longer the leader the insurgency will
pay for his crimes
I don't like this at 6 p.m. local time
Batman will be executed at Strykers
Island may rau have mercy on his soul

for tonight sorry gotta cancel new
orders since when is that stopped you
yeah you know what the sad thing is
about these character designs hmm Wow I
believe this game came out after Arkham
Asylum so we know they could be done
better yep at the time we know they
could have been done better
well what a grandpa hooks I can grab a
hook booyah that is that's very you know
that booyah is very satisfying I bet I
can act I bet this place has some extra
shit I can Mack around right behind his
good and evil childhood right now good
cyborg okay I was pretending to be evil
cyborg obviously the interest rate the
bad guys but evil evil er Catwoman
discovered me so so Catwoman is evil in
this universe
well evil er right she live an evil for
a while right she's still bad guy
stop it she spent pac-man's I lied for a
while about to get real up in here
he says clash success 15% health regen
are they engaged in the comics Batman
who killed the bat kitten well if they
are you know that won't last
she's marrying Batman well I'm still
turn remember they would have broke them
up years ago
hello comic book relationships just
aren't allowed to last right I found a
duplicate of me
Wonder Woman out don't mind me just
hacking your neural network pack meaning
you're totally gonna have a hack battle
yep how about I return the favor
we're gonna have to press dramatic music
dude heck is armed
you can't keep hacking you apparently
for real like men
fine by me like cyborgs
let's see what weird places we can go I
want to knock you through some shit they
were guy but I cannot go through that I
don't mind that something is a cutscene
and not a QuickTime event that doesn't
bother me okay
considering that they've done those
little QuickTime events throughout this
game though it feels strange that that
wasn't right I'm not gonna complain
about it it just doesn't fit the pattern
yeah that was totally an opportunity for
their hit X yeah hit beat a hack come
over here I want to see if I can send
you through this but all that matters
that's all I care about at this moment
yes it's like sending him you know oh
fuck you planet
does anyone actually like quick time
events anyway no they're the worst thing
oh I'm not complaining that it wasn't
one second right agree that's that was a
perfect opportunity for a little agree
fine here you send me through this one
how about that we're holding the back
attack there we go I just wanted to get
sent I wanted someone to get central
holy shit who's that that's Darkseid oh

look at this way to the background who
the fuck are they I have no fucking out
of this gigantica right is that her name
I don't know enough about these
characters that's like a Wonder Woman
enemy gigantica I want to say alright
alright alright the other ones Adam then
apparently yeah that would make sense
so the atom does big - not just small oh
yeah oh shit
well I didn't want to get sensitive sex
time but hey we're here hi are some more
of Giganta they might be gigantic ah
get him so many fights oh there's a big
robot guy hey big robot guy that bar you
for a second okay can I do something
with you yeah
this is crazy
right like what do you do robot yeah do
something right out hate him this time
there you go
you can shut your opponent into the
robot no time for that now no I was
close to death yeah and I didn't want to
do the fight oh yeah thank you for each
level 20 I don't know what that means
I don't think that's not a good you beat
me to it another contract lost you're
both gonna make the same awful he made
it personal torture just torture well he
didn't kill your alternate-universe
daughter or something there was there
were there were some side eyes with for
depth strokes as new might be a bad guy
my neural network the plan was who is
that someone look up who does the voice
for Deathstroke in this game it was good
enough for me yeah I asked myself what
if what happened to Lois happen to Iris
made sense at first that people got what
they deserved
Martok from Star Trek jg has not
actually gonna kill Batman he's just
bait to catch the real Batman I don't
know how that is
Deep Space nine is Mark arrow talk rich
it's a Martok from Deep Space nine how
did Mark talk was honestly
oh the king and general guy yeah yeah
the one I clean up okay work becomes
friends with Mikey eventually becomes
the new leader who the new chancellor
yeah he's a good character all right no
Deathstroke oh that's fun though that's
cute that's cute game took me a second I
haven't I haven't watched as much Deep
Space 9 as I have the rest of Trek
release the TNG and and original the
original series yeah yeah yeah I'm with
you all right hey let's let's get to the
the point in the stream rich in which we
thank all the people who have subscribed
to us during the stream do we have any
tips first thing you know I'm gonna
whine I like somewhat arson - oh how
many I got here who a guy here what you
got there but oh by the way the the the
US just won bronze and figure skating so
yeah yeah care abouts a figure skating
yeah so congratulations
Game four quarter says always great to
come home from work to a stream I know
Mike and Jay don't really do interviews
but could you suggest reaching out to
Joe Rogan to do his podcast that would
be an amazing crossover oh I know that
Joe Rogan has an interest in
interviewing you know there's others
different levels I think a lot of people
like his show I like Joe Rogan sure my
like his podcast but now shinola lead 5
says what was the point of tutorial when
game restarts and makes it easy to beat
in all realness we don't really care on
how you play the game we're just happy
listening to you guys happy streaming
right I just wanted to have some basic
idea of what you can do with a game I
probably what I ended up button-mashing
anyway cuz it's a fighter and it's just
so it's just so much with the combo it's
just so much well but and you know you
button mashing then eventually you
realize ok if I do this that happens but
going through the tutorial does help it
gives you a context of what's even
possible like that whole like knocking
people through walls thing yeah if that
would have happened just was like whoa
that was weird I guess that was only on
that one stage we wouldn't have known
that it was a thing you could yeah yeah
yeah
and Ron Jon Donson says hashtag free
Daniel day-lewis I know nothing about
this I will remain neutral I have no
idea what the fuck that is referencing I
have no idea okay
I'm caught up all right so now let us
thank the subscribers oh wait we have
one last one that just came in oh do I
say no you could say no if you want not
a missus to Jack like you I was
disappointed in Altered carbon I'm still
a fan of the original books Netflix
pretty much ruined it all also was
executive produced by the lady behind
Terminator Genisys oh yeah and it's like
I had no expectations going in so I
don't want to say I was disappointed by
altered carbon it just was very bland
but it had it had little sparks of
really neat ideas like they they had
these great characters to like character
I would much rather like watch a movie
about these other characters than the
main character who was bland emic mcdoon
man bland emic good at everything they
had really neat ideas and none of the
neat ideas went anywhere and it was
overall the super bland so I like it
wasn't even a disappointing thing it was
just like a man
chap Jack was having so much fun I
didn't I didn't have the heart to ask
for the controller to try a few rounds
oh and I'm sorry I was fun I can do this
I was having I was I could tell I could
I'm not an I'm not a complete asshole
thanks I'm fun my Jack have fun well I
know you just like you've been you've
been leaving shuffling all day I know

thumbs could handle any more rich

thanks for introducing me to this game
but what happened to the last few days
of my life it does it sucks you in cuz
all that's all you're thinking about is
that Matt is that card Matthew looking
at those cards going what can I do how
the hell do you keep up with defense in
that game how the hell do you do it a
little bit of its luck and a little bit
of it is is building the right defense
though you know I got I got lucky once
and I got I had a card that
and I got to keep all of my shield yeah
she'll didn't disintegrate right that
was an awesome card because yeah they
that's so expensive to use near the end
of the game you get hit for 45 health
just for the full turn it takes right to
set that up yeah absolutely
that's what eventually what eventually
killed me tonight was the the strength
card that that took three essence to use
yeah that was a whole turn right to just
take it in the face right and then it
took like two more turns just to get up
to a decent strength attack absolutely

welcome back turbo Dangerfield who says
I love it when you hate play games
please do so more often thank you for
the entertainment that is better than
98% of network television
well that while that is frozen I hate
play but I was gonna say it is it is
true that we're better than 98% of
network television absolutely that was
not a hate play actually I I like
fighting games I it's fun to you know
play as superheroes and beat people up
that was fun that was not that was not a
Jesus Christ shut up already
turbo Dangerfield we're criticizing the
costumes that doesn't mean we hate
everything about the game oh yeah they
were so ugly yeah question number 16
okay check Fox says hey so it turns out
that the Nash
no committee for videogame and anime
recommendations doesn't allow official
recommendations their oversight
subcommittee sent me a citation last
week for $600
anyway thanks for the stream this
doesn't allow unofficial recommendation
oh okay I think I get it
Luke's kitty but we're just gonna move
on because reference to something I have
forgotten about probably I think it's
just like people recommend video games
and anime to us all the time okay and so
they're saying that there's an official
committee of video game and anime
recommendations I don't know then and
they've been not sanctioning any of the
anime and video game recommendations so
they got a fine what what color is
Goku's hair now and why is that going to
make me want to watch it it's it's
purple at the top but blue at the roots
and the more power he gets the more blue
shows up because blue signifies light
waves bouncing off of his hair which is
like the atmosphere and his enemy is
green which absorbs his energy which
comes across as blue because it bounces
off the light race you're trying to
scientifically break down Goku no I was
making it somebody done this
somebody tried to scientifically break
down Goku he's an alien doesn't matter I
was making all that up
I don't his hair's not blue or maybe it
is I don't know I've seen pictures of
him with blue hair I think he's done
blue at some point I have no idea I am
it was I think they recently added and
blue and magenta I was pulling a hundred
percent of that out of my button and I
don't know nothing about nothing
how about zip ubermensch zero to be fair
Goku was a cool character
we're way up
MZ Phu for 17 months in a row says beer

what were we playing this weekend this

submarine submarine yeah yeah yeah we
