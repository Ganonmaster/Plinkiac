but will they forget about Dre probably
not
now that Apple bought beats by dre and
he has a daily radio station I can't
imagine that anyone is going to forget
about Dre
anytime soon first play first person
server sure we'll give that a try again
that's seem to work out except for you
know when we all died
pickle with no salt I can tell you that
project Hornet is not a running gag I
know it may seem like that because you
know we don't talk about it but right
that's the thing if it is not a running
gag that's that's what I can assure you
people are working on project Hornet
Tupman top top men all right we got our
group no I'm going first person you can
do what you want yeah I would first
person hi ready all right do we have
microphones everyone oh you know no all
right all right
you watch your hands rich well I'm
watching them right now but I think I
mean did you wash them and always
arguably compulsively have you have you
ever like been in that situation where
you just clearly watch someone leave the
men's room without watching washing
their hands and you just want to go what
the fuck dude you were just touching you
junk
I usually don't pay that much attention
to what other people are doing in the
men's room I do my own thing and I get
out well sure but you know like a lot of
times like I'll be washing my hands and
I'll see someone you know in the corner
of my eye at the urinal and then they'll
just walk right out you just go what the
fuck man see me I'll just I'll just lift
the lid to the garbage can and I'll feel
the need to wash that hand sure sure
me but hey Burt Zilla hey rich but ready
up I'm Oh
you two birds illa let's go
apparently I think twice in a room there
we go I'm ready after I read it
what if it's clean junk it unless you
just came out of a shower it's not that
clean
your hands are touching your junk don't
you do it
oh desert map no matter what wash your
hands after every time you go to the
bathroom every time whoa whoa I'm in a
prison okay that's prison that's great

I had a Dead Rising moment I went to go
pick up this two-by-four
can't get out of the tiny window this
person likes Mexican wrestlers alright
alright where are we going
hey do you guys have microphones is our
microphone on at this point I'm assuming
they don't would have heard something
and I don't think our microphones are on
oh you might have muted your voice why
would I have for me yes Mic Check

I can see a little talkie icon when I
talk Jack okay well let's go uh say when

right I turned around I'm gonna be with
you I'm with you I'm right behind you

there I don't know I don't know the
three of us are all close together and
that's good one person went off I don't

point and point that's not leading
that's just being in front okay let's go
to this building and check it out listen
uh not leading that's being informed
that's my point is
let's see if there's anything in here we
have okay yeah yeah basically we're
inside the circle so we need to take
this opportunity to find the good shit
you know extended mag yeah all right all
right where's everyone else
they're spreading out we're spreading
out they're off doing their own thing I
don't know I don't know why we're
spreading out all right let's go let's
go east
all right we're going east let's go
let's go this way let's keep exploring
the city looking for people to kill
where's everyone else before we go off
exploring without everyone Jack where's
everyone else no no everyone else is
still oh my god what it's fine
oh my god it's fine
Burt zilla's they're all right here hey
everything's fine got a suppressor for
my handgun that's not oh okay thank you
all right the soccer field here where's
uh what's happening to birds illa bird
Dilip Oh yep moving out we're moving out
I think Bert Zilla has AF Cadis I think
Bert Zilla had to go yeah and we are now
yeah we are now a group of three ah okay
you know that happens I'll take it
yeah take it but I don't think it's a
good time to play around with it so I'm
who's that correctly news we're not here
is that a usable where said no probably
not
no the military ones not okay let's
check out this big building see if
anyone's in here oh hello I want you
Scarl
look like a good gun you look like a gun
that I can shoot people with I like that
I like that about you
there's a medkit over here level two
vests you Inc you want a med kit sure
take a med kit what's the suppressor a
suppressor for my scar roll nice and a
2x all rich yeah yeah I don't all right
no one's staying together I think we're
all oh but I think I think our blue
friend got killed
yeah Bert Zilla guy killed them
cathode ray is not talking to us that's
fine that's fine but is it
oh this looks like a fortified area
maybe we can get on the top of this
building how in the circle are we weird
like in the circle we are in the circle
my friend let's let's stay in here let's
look at this place and then get on the
roof
and then we can be kings of the roof
you and your roofs yeah go to bottom
it's gonna be the death of you someday
jack it's gonna be we're gonna oh oh we
can climb on these things looking get up
here get up here get up yeah yeah yeah
what's up here
oh I love it up here that's to be oh
yeah oh fuck yeah this year there's all
sorts of good Oh what's this like a
child that's a fish it's a fancy med
good let's be up here let's be up here
and then when people come in here we'll
shoot their asses this is the plan we're
gonna be up here and then when people
come in here loot we're gonna shoot them
from up above and we're gonna have the
high ground oh it's gonna be so great
they won't know what fucking hit them
this is the plan this is a great plan
you're welcome for this plan oh and
there's people outside - how far outside
we mean you saw something no I hear I
hear gunshots you know you're all the
gunshots
this is the plan shoot their head so
they can't think no more that's a great
plan there's there's someone like just
shooting up a storm
look at that this is gonna be great
they're gonna come in here they're gonna
think they're gonna think they got the
high ground and then we're gonna just
we're gonna light them up rich we're
gonna light them the fuck up they won't
know what's up they're out there
shooting each other like a bunch of
assholes there's a bunch of people to
like our West Northwest area
yeah sounds like it's coming almost
northeast to me and we're east you think
I'm thinking it's coming from the
opposite direction
what was that was that me I don't know
what it was that was me I shot that I
have no idea how I shot that I'll be
honest with you I think I don't think it
was on Jack you'd be crazy Jack I don't
think my finger was on the mouse you you
be crazy
well we're still in the circle so yeah
this might not be the most exciting play
but it kind of works you know 22:45 my
hand goes 45 my jerky motions make you
seasick huh worry about that you just
keep an eye on that door
I also get on the roof well you know I
don't know if we can get on the roof in
here but this is roof enough we have the
high ground we have you know we have a
strategic advantage Jack you're keeping
an eye that far east entrance the the
north entrance I don't think well
there's there's two North yeah and then
I can't see any I'm looking at the one
to the left and a little door yeah I
can't see any eastern Lee entrances from
where I am but I have a decent shot out
at the the two big doors there's
cathode-ray just hanging out with us
that's great
how you doing cathode thanks for joining
us thanks for being part of our team
team sit still a team you know team were
still alive oh I understand
oh hello ready what's gonna happen oh I
see a motorcycle there's a motorcycle
there's a motorcycle to the north oh is
that it yeah
is he still moving yeah he's still
moving do you see him no okay his
motorcycle stopped his motorcycle miss
stopped I shot the railing and not him I
had a decent shot but I shot the railing
somebody's dying out there somebody's
dying out there
39 alive it's a lot of people to kill
should go after those shots should we I
don't think we should cuz they'll come
in here looking for shit yeah I think
they're beyond looking for shed or
looking for cover
either way possibly either way doo doo
doo doo outside his death inside his
death
everything is death oh and now we're in
the red zone so we're definitely staying
in here so someone might definitely come
in here to get away from the bombs who's
it gonna be it might be us
there's cathode ray don't shoot him I'll
try not to
but you usually usually not successful
at that well you know he's right there
rich you see him he's in my crosshair I
could just do it once I could just shoot
him once don't think anyone's gonna come
in they might not yeah that's fine we're
still alive right all right let's do it
all right so we are we moving on I'm
moving on
circles closing circles closing we got
to close with it man
starting to think that cathode ray is
not a team player
you figured that out that I did
Parrish
is that cathode ray shooting probably oh
oh you're shooting it then someone shoot
that at me I think where's that coming
from
that was me I was trying to shoot at
their car passing just to see if I get
one of those crazy lucky long shots Jack
sent us is it a car where no that's a
little house I think there is a truck
over there cathode ray is heading
directly towards a truck I don't know if
we want a truck because looks like a
working draw too close to the line but
you know maybe we do
yeah
fuck it why not looks like he's got an
idea
alright cathode we're with you oh don't
run me over please thank you
shit
someone shooting at us yep
shit
shit
everything's fine the joy of trucks
right if we can find a place with some
decent cover it won't be it won't be all
for naught you know hope they're rich
rich they're all right
is that all of us yep
let's see where were they whoa
just arrange let's see what's happening
over here how did you kill us nice scope
Oh dissen a shit that's fair that's fair
there's just a nice shot that's fine we
have that God guile we have a holding
right click Oh Amos
hey Bert Zilla there's no way to change
it we have to hold down the aim rather
than tap I keep holding it down and I
don't go into the sights mode well if
you hold it down it just kind of focus
focus as you're away where it just takes
me to straighten the sights you can
probably change that in your how do we
do this how do we uh all right you guys
Burt Zilla and cathode ray you got a
dropout we need new people thank you for
playing with us oh yeah I'll just leave
team by II
all right you sending me uh yeah another
thing of a jig I'll send you another one
in just a second you come here
oh there's epitaxy a tepid ox is
insteresting ram and van Duren you guys
come and join us epitaxy and veined rims
we need new victims we need we needs you
know some people with microphones would
be nice
there's van dreams come on up a duck's
right click join us yeah yeah all right
now we got a team
should be in there
control game points on the prune it
directs toggle camera no that's not it
probably aim hold what's on hold
why is it toggling I don't know
oh you probably looking for 80 80s you
want holds okay
Oh aim-down-sights that makes sense yeah
hi
let's do this I don't think pipes is
available Debbie Harry and we don't have
pipes to carry us here we we got epitaxy
we got vans rinth and we got me and we
got rich and that's the best we can do
that's all you can hope for I'm gonna
light some people on fire I'm gonna
throw some smoke down then we're gonna
throw a grenade yeah I'll tell me first
thing I want to put xsplit back on
Saturday you don't do what let's play
this oh yeah
hey evidence van Rijn microphone Hey
yeah yeah we need people's microphone so
we can talk to you guys so we can come
up with plans that will eventually fail
anyway but it's nice to talk about gonna
win before they fail you know I'm Sam we
got this guy's ear right here all right
where are we going let's go let's go
into the quarry okay
okay into the Deaf chord jump as soon as
you can go into deathcore go go go go
death quarry is that the kind of patch
of land erm yeah yeah yeah what up
that's not why I got a head shot
I don't think van drew oh now that's you
I don't think van Rijn oh wait van Duren
are you talking yep are you talking that
I am I don't hear me i I do oh you do
yeah oh that's right cuz I haven't
turned off so I don't hear you
do you want to change that so you can
hear what other people are saying I do
want to change that not at this moment
though cuz we got we got shit to do I
think we're alone for now
I I'm coming down to you guys I got an
auto shotgun and then it's approximately
hit at the moment there's an extra P 92
in this house come in shitload of
pistols if anybody wants fricking
pistols I'll take the animal a lot of
pistols
are we in the circle we are in the
circle oh we have some that's great
that's great I'm gonna come down by you
and then I'm gonna change my settings
that's my plan hey I could use something
better than a pistol we got we got time
we're in the circle pick well there's a
house east can go check it out
to change my audio settings only team
now I should be able to hear you guys
hey hi anybody need a med kit
it's a med kit up in this crepe
I got no backpack to carry it though I'm
full it's so not what I what I need to
know now is how I can mute just rich
because I'm hearing myself talking about
a half-ass I'm getting some fucked up
feedback myself
yeah oh that song get in the house
if anyone eventually gets an assault
rifle I have a bunch of mods for it okay
okay there's another bag on the roof of
the house how can I mute just rich I
don't think you can son of a bitch
Peppa docks do you have an m4 16
all right well then I just um I just
went back to muting everything I just
went back to meeting everyone okay
that's probably a terrible idea
well everyone was complaining about
getting feedback okay I would rather you
know you're just gonna have to guide me
you're gonna have to be be my ears and
there's a police vest in this Shack
Fenny one needs one yeah I could use one
now oh you got a car which Shack this
this one right here I'm gonna go with
that potox and check out that other
house oh there's a car right here yep
just in case we need a car
this is a tree growing in the carp you
know nature as they do I got a shotgun
and a pistol so somebody sees an extra
salt rifle lying around and you don't
need one
I could use it yeah we gotta go look for
some more shit if we had let's let's get
in the car go somewhere okay let's head
to another house but if somebody does
find an m416 I have a foregrip a stock
and a site
um where do we want to go oh wherever
where I I don't know we're in the circle

might be looted up here is what they're
saying
oh okay so there could be people have

Jack need Isco for a salt rifle Jack do
you need a scope for your assault rifle
I do need a scope he does he does indeed
actually I got a I got a spare 2x cuz I
got a 4x on mine if anybody wants to X

Jack yeah that'd be nice I'll give it to
you inside the house not out in the open
where were where died instantly land is
sure sure there you go hope they're
coming back someone's at the door rich
yeah
spectate see what epitaxy is up to you
like gotcha
going going don't do anything rich I
thought they were on the other side of
the house how do you change who your
spectating I want to go around to turn
out they were behind us cereal they go
your van Duren thumb up at other states
I got plenty on my body okay go take
them
shit
I'm just gonna take the painkillers and
stuff
I think this is a Jacke reference rich
on tonight's Star Trek Discovery there's
a planet named Harlech okay that's very
strange
yeah that's a very interesting
coincidence it could be a reference to
me yeah sure why not I can't imagine
that people know who I somebody involve
what Star Trek would be familiar with
red letter media but be familiar enough
with us where they know what my online
nickname is you know
that would be a level it was necessary
that would be possible impossible but it
was slightly unbelievable oh I have a
really great med pack on my body inside
the house by the way a really great med
pack on my body that's inside the house
one of those killer med packs that one
yep Pepa Doc's got it epitaxy got it all
right let's move yes I know this isn't
my type of game chef I got seven first
dates and you know you know what would
that mean this time what killed me is I
shot my shotgun once yeah and then as a
twitch reflex something I do very often
in something like overwatch I hit the
reload button right away after one shot
fired just so I could have that full and
while I was reloading someone came in
and so that was my mistake because that
like that's a no that's an overwatch
habit of mine it's just like you fire a
couple bullets hit that reload as soon
as you can just to get your to make sure
you have a full clip in but say I
enjoyed this game well enough with other
people it's a fine social experience it
makes for good stream I think so
no and you know you just I don't have
much experience at
player shooting and you don't have to
like this game I'm not saying like it's
the greatest game ever made I just it's
it is an experience that I do enjoy even
though you can die quickly and suddenly
how do I play with you you have to be my
Steam friend I believe because I'm the
or Rich's steam friend if you have pub G
add me on Steam I'll go I'll go through
and add some friends after after a round
or two first-person mouth shooter I
thought you loved doom alright this is a
very different beast from doom oh my god
despite the superficial similarities of
being first person at a shooter is a
very different beast yes yep that is
that is very very true this is one of us
simulation do miss totally educate what
I need to figure out I need to figure
out a way in which I need to figure out
a way in which I can listen to our
teammates but not hear us if there's a
way I could just mute you and this right
now you got time chat help me out here B
you need to be my you need to be my
collective knowledge based chat while we
look into this settings sound oh this is
the house man Jackie one doom is power
fantasy pub G is powerless in this
fantasy yes yes this is survival do doom
is you're the big bad boss I freely
admit I prefer my shooters to be power
fantasies right when you kick the ass
fuck look at the next circle of course
who doesn't look damn it we have to go
cross this fucking bridge what is it
what is the knowledge base saying is is
there a way to just mute one player
should we get it car and try to drive
through it you didn't look for a boat
oh yeah yeah let's do that let's go to
the coast or else I hear me
thief games are the anti power fantasy
yeah but they're not shooters the thief
games set a boat I think push-to-talk
then you can have chat on and then just
talk through me Oh pop Oh pop that is a
guy 250 there's gotta be more first
dating well you're you only coming from
anyway right right I guess I could just
do push-to-talk it'll make it harder to
you know Kate whatever then but there's
another one at the house what if I did
push the talk sure
and then what's your push to what's your

Sten one behind us no no yeah there's
there's a couple people that are coming
to this exact same spot
big old all of those people are us that
it's fine

these little houses here maybe I'll find
a weapon quick okay do it find it shit
shit shit shit shit shit shit tell me
Jack your second shit shit serpentine
serpentine serpentine I've got an m16
Church here I beat someone to death yeah
yeah great
right here right here
you beat somebody plant 5060 like real
it took him up yeah they're on the
ground crawling around Oh beat it hit
more punch him I got him I gotta go
there's the groom was filled with smoke
I literally I could not see him now I
kind of desperately need healing sure
of and rinse down down or dead dead
I got one that was me I think they're
shooting at you
who's shooting me they got me he just
picked up the m16 so watch out for well
fuck me how many of them did we get
there's one right there
yeah yeah he likely has my gear I have
no weapons grenade I'm rich you got this
I don't think I have anything I don't
have a grade or anything you already
pushed a guy to death oh yeah but I got
no health I can't survive that again I
need to find a weapon and shoot him in
the fucking back
I'm behind him I don't think he sees me
he doesn't know I'm here
yeah yeah well
Jack you're it huh I have killed three
people I'm in how many people came here
if you killed three a whole shit done
well it's got to be two teams cuz there
was two at the beginning Jack killed
three and then one killed rich Jesus
Christ I think he's trying to go around
you
why did rich move towards him because
one I if I couldn't find a weapon I've
heard maybe maybe he was already low on
health from a firefight and I could try
and punch him in the frickin back and
maybe that would do it so legitimate
strategy yeah
more people check again
you're rocking two shotguns no a shotgun
an Uzi I got like nothing
I think yet a sawed-off in there - oh he
does have it the sawed-off can replace
your handgun that's neat automatic check
there's something good there you go
fella mommy go ahead and fill them up oh
they're saying that the sawed-off I
forget you can't hear can be used as a
sidearm yeah I didn't know that that's
neat where's the circle jack I'm inside
it you're inside it okay I'm inside it I
I uh shit I got I got I got shit guy guy
kind of shit weapons there's a lot of
dead people around here where did you
guys die did you have anything good did
you have any good weapons I didn't I'm
16 they might have taken it though I
think you can see our bodies
on the mini-map I'm just gonna go check
out this area over here
you can see their body something you see
where they fell
and they said they had stuff you could
take hey I keep forgetting I have to
relay messages oh I'm gonna loot your
guys's body
don't you worry I I've got nothing I'm
the one the one that's over on the right
I got I got literally nuttin I should
give Jack the headphones that make sense
oh sure hold on give me a second all
right
well it's like but now I'm like because
these headphones like now I have
headphones on top of my headphones hey
guys can you hear me yes sir I it's like
it doesn't super matter because uh you
know you're dead but I guess you know
you're here motivation exactly you can
uh you can give me some hints yeah
besides our bodies there's maybe like at
least three people in that area dead
bodies nice yeah we'll see if we can
find anything fun like I just want a
grenade I found a good on are there
all the shotgun ammo I could ever ask
for
backpack level two all right all right
well cool it's just you know it's always
exciting for me whenever I get to kill
someone on stream to prove I'm not
entirely incompetent that's what I like
is just like see guys I'm not always
terrible sometimes I even do good that's
fine I know this game is not my bag and
I'm fine with that
I really am
this is a really bad idea but I'm gonna
head over to that giant building over
there
well I'm sure people already are but
maybe I can get some sloppy seconds
that's where that's all I'm hoping for
here I have no long ranged weapons
whatsoever so I gotta fight it quick and
dirty see if there's anything up here oh
hello giant building that's up here I
think I think Jack prefers a third
person rather than first I do I do
prefer a third person I like having the
larger field of view
look bag extended mag nice all the
shotgun shells oh my god I do have the
sawed-off still actually I do have this
out if I didn't even realize that I had
it
oh wait I think that's an Uzi handle
that yeah thanks did you put it on you
see I did put it on my uz go that way
but this stuff is on this area is
unlooted so so I'm gonna just hang out
here and loot for one hot minute
remember
all right jack remember the last tip you
read was ah maybe okay name a few and
maybe I can know maybe I'll I'll tell
you
how's your weekend going I assume I read
that in Hawaii okay yep thanks for
answering my theatre etiquette when he
read that one him it finally happened
I'm sick of Star Wars okay I didn't read
that one okay jiggy puff says it finally
happened I'm sick of Star Wars thank you
I guess
why nothing I did Star Wars made you
sick of Star right I don't have that
kind of power no one would want that
much power
some of Jonah says Jane um not sure how
that's pronounced ji na hey Jack hi it
was fun playing overwatch with you last
month storm Templar yeah did you know
that a recent study showed that people's
brains cannot differentiate real-life
friends and TV show characters yay yeah
I'm not sure I don't think that's
everybody but there's there's always
been crazy people out there who's that
guy that killed people because he wanted
to impress Jodie Foster right wasn't
that a famous one he wanted to impress
Jodie Foster's nobody killed himself
I think it's currently in jail no no
didn't he like attempt to assassinate a
president or something yes yeah that was
what it was because he wanted Jodie
Foster to notice that Hinckley was it I
don't know nothing about nothing man and
that my sink Lee cool that sounds like a
hate that's total Hinkley move 100%
Hinkley yeah the guy who shot Reagan who
was not dead he's not dead no he's just
in jail yeah because he's a crazy crazy
cool great
I think there's been debate about
letting him out because they say he's
somewhat healthier than he used to be
but I don't I don't think that's gonna
happen
it's very likely someone in here right
they just let him out they just let him
is that true Wow get in well he didn't
kill anyone
oh just attempted murder though that
might not entirely be true I mean at the
time I think everyone survived the
shooting but I think in the last decade
or so somebody eventually succumbed to
like succumbed to complications from the
injury of big shot oh really
like the Senators or people who was shot
with Reagan Oh weird and so you got
something like you know 30 years after
the fact he gets a murder charge
sure well that was the case with Charles
Whitman the Texas tower that's right
that's right like 15 years ago now
somebody who was injured like you know
shot in the kidney they you know we're
on dialysis or something for years and
they they just got sick of they stopped
treatment and they died and then Charles
Whitman he got another notch on his belt
even though it was like you know 50
years later or whatever 40 years later
what do you shot Reagan if he knew Jodie
Foster was a lesbian no because we're
talking about a crazy person who is not
like by definition someone who was not
reasonable oh right even if he knew
Jodie Foster was a lesbian he's probably
still would've shot Reagan to impress
Jodie Foster because yeah because that
was his in his head I don't even know if
it was like a relationship with Jodie
Foster I just think he like wanted to
meet her or something you know like it
wasn't even a will you be my girlfriend
it was a creepy kind of love
next rocking up the charts we have
creepy kind of love boom boom down bow
back away from me creepy girl of some
objects creepy there's someone on the
other side of these rocks I'm spectating
Jack does it really matter here there
you go there you go alright umm leftover
beefcake says what is this I heard on
Twitter that there won't be any more
prereq reviews shocked face emoji
what is this jack I have no idea where
you're talking about okay nobody has any
idea what you're talking about
it's my fault that Jack wanted to do
somewhat recently Okami do it and I
squash that as I say you've squashed you
squash to the last like eight that's a
large exaggerate that is a large
exaggeration you've squashed a fair
number recently and so I've just kind of
been waiting for rich to be in the mood
okay and you know
what's going on this might not happen it
might happen we don't know what's going
up huh what's coming up oh okay please

Boudreau 45 says any chance for more
Friday the 13th uh well not not right
now but it's it's a it's a game I've
turned to every now and then because I
feel that makes for good streams even
though I've largely well I've almost
entirely stopped playing it on my own
time but like like like Pope G which I'm
not you know I'm not in love with this
game but I think it makes for good
stream so we i-i've suggested we played
this couple times and the same with
Friday the 13th
stay to that rock yeah there's someone
right there look at the detail level you
have do you oh you have your settings
turned down probably okay

sometimes but you might be able to find
a spot if you just click randomly wait

pick that teammate up go back go back
what Toronto go back no Jer kill them
they're shooting at me I wanted to go
