[0:30]  Jack: Hey Josh!
Josh: Oh hey, Jack!
JK: Welcome to the Wheel of the Worst
JH: Thank you
JK: It looks like we have a fantastic selection of movies…
JH: It’s definitely a wheel
JK: And, uh, we have new movies, we have old movies
JH: Ohhh
JK: Movies we didn’t get to last time
JH: Ok….I don’t know what happens when I’m not here
JK: So, Josh
JH: Yes
JK: What movies do we have here?
JH: Well, let’s start here, with New! Dancin’ Grannies Mature Fitness
JK: Uh, The Family Guide to the Internet: What it’s all about, surf the net! Chat online. Learning is easy and fun for all
JH: Now, next, I hope this one comes up, I’m very excited about...Tree Stand Safety
JK: And why--why are you excited about it?
JH: Because look at it
JK: Gary Coleman...For Safety’s Sake. Gary Coleman was….Webster and he was on a hit tv show called Punky Brewster in the 80s. So what’s next?
JH: Cat Sitter!
JK: A 1 hour VHS
Jh: [Claps] It’s the video cats love to watch! And it’s got “two paws up”....we’re not cats, though
[Jack turns the Wheel, the video is called Massage...The Touch of Love, nobody speaks, Josh paces around a bit]
[The Wheel turns] JH: Oh, but hey, uh...this one could actually be very useful to me, uh, useful to me, because I spend a lot of time in the house by myself, and it’s called Key Matters: How to Have a Key Party--no wait, “preparing for children’s time alone”
[Jack spins the Wheel] And finally, everybody’ been asking about The Shoji Tabuchi show, and I have a feeling that everyone’s going to regret it, and by everyone I mean us
JK: Hmm-mm

[2:53] Jay: The wavy effect on the flashbacks is really distracting
JK: Well, no, this is a nightmare effect

[3:30] JH: Guys, did you just see her just reach her hand right into the grill and get burned?
J: Is that what happened?
M: Yeah
JH: Their child’s an idiot
Jessi: Right in front of her dad
J: Did she just grab the burger up…
JH: She was just like, “ow! Fire’s hot!”

[3:45] JK: Well, Rich Evans, that was a disappointing movie that we just watched
Rich: That was a thing
JK: We watched a thing on a screen
R: Yes, can we watch another thing on another screen?
JK: Let’s find out what we’re gonna watch!
R: Ok [Jack weakly(?) spins the Wheel]
JK: Big spin! Big spin! Big spin! Big spin!
R: That was...that was your spin?
JK: Did you like that?
R: That was terrible!

[4:40] [A girl covers a boy’s body with a white tablecloth, everyone laughs]
M: She has--she has--she has paramedic experience 
JS: Hide the body from your parents!

[5:06] JK: Why is that microphone so big?
R: He’s just that small, isn’t he?

[5:23] R: “Jack Example?!”
M: What an unfortunate last name

[6:03] [Rich is holding a fire extinguisher]
R: Alright, clear out! I’m gonna (???) [Looks at the fire extinguisher] How do I use this thing?

[6:56] Girl: An Internet Service Provider? What’s that?
J: It’s a--it’s an Internet Service Provider

[7:32] M: I guess all of them were instructional videos
JH: I learned...no, I didn’t learn anything. I learned a little bit, but really just more...you know, from Key Matters I learned how to frighten your children, uh, from Gary Coleman, I learned that Gary Coleman is a dick, and from--from The Family Guide to the Internet I learned about set design
(...)
M: I just can’t wait for the wall to fall down in the background

[8:20] R: Well, well, what I learned from Key Matters was that, people...come in all colors…[Jack nods] but if you’re hispanic, you still talk with an accent

[9:38] JK: This was...the--the suburban sprawl white kids who had--know nothing about being a latchkey kid, who--like, if a stranger did come up to them and say “oh I’ve got candy and a puppy that I need to find,” they would--they would go with that person
M: I would help that person to find the puppy [Rich laughs]
JK: Right, right
M: But I wouldn’t be here now
JK: Mike would have been kidnapped, most likely raped, multiple times, before killed and dumped somewhere north of Illinois
M: And that would’ve been the best outcome for me

[10:49] [Jack and Josh high five, mocking the kids in the video]

[10:54] M: Having kids looks like a lot of work

[11:39] M: I forgot about the ginger kid
JH: He looooves peanut butter
M: And do you really put carrots in peanut butter?
JH: Yeah, yeah
JK: First of all, what don’t you put in peanut butter?
JH: Ants on a log
R: Cheese
JK: Celery
M: But not carrots….Carrots?
JH: Most of them, yes!
JK: Why not?

[12:00] [A house is on fire]
M: Oh
JS: Oh my god
M: Look…
JS: Rich, did you live there? [Jay laughs]
M: Rich was cooking french fries

[14:09] JS: Gary Coleman is God in this video

[16:24] Girl: Hello? I have an emergency. A man’s trying to get in my back door
M: Woah
JH: Did she say the Mayor was trying to get in her back door
R: She said the same thing when she turned 18
JS: In that other video…
M: The Mayor...Backdoor Mayor

[19:28] JH: And there’s the question there, when the neighbor walks in, checks in, it’s just like everything’s fine, why was that fucking door open?
M: That’s a good question, yeah, there’s no logical explanation
JH: Doors don’t just open
M: A very, very strong wind...
JH: There’s latches. It was probably locked
[Silence]
R I’ve--I’ve seen that happen, that happened at my--my grandmother’s house once, when the wind blew the door open
M: [Squints, shakes his head] What?
R: It happened
JH: She was there, though, right?
R: Yeah
JH:...So there you go
R: I was there--I just--I remember the door opening...and there was wind
JH: I don’t even know what’s happening anymore!
M: What the fuck are you talking about?
[Jay laughs in the background, Rich chuckles]
JH: How did you guys do this last time with these fucking videos?

[20:25] M: Rich, did you--as the man that burned down his grandmother’s house making french fries, did you learn anything about safety?

[21:25] [Rich starts making moaning noises, Mike makes a disgusted/confused expression]

[22:02] M: [Reading the back of the box] “Learn all about...web pages...browers…”

[22:22] Man: And you might recruit a computer-savvy friend or relative to help
R: I thought that was the point of this!

[23:14] M: Yeah, there’s several typos on the back of the box, as well as in--in the actual dialogue of the--the video [Rich and Josh laugh]
Boy: And what fun would be life without MTV? [Chuckles]
M: Wait! He said “what fun would be life”
Rich and Josh: “Without MTV”
M: “What...what fun would life be”
JH: Yeah. And that’s--
R: He’s reading it straight--
M: “What fun would be life”?
R: Nobody--nobody--nobody bothered to fix the script. And he’s just reading the script
J: Look, they had 40 minutes to shoot this video

[25:16] R: The father--”father knows best, and I’m going to sit down and explain these things to you right now, and this is how the world works”
JH: Yes
R: And the--and the dumb daughter, like, she acknowledges that she’s so--[In a girly, high-pitched voice] “it’s so easy...even I can do it”
(...)
JS: “I usually only make sandwiches”

[26:16] JH: There are--there are things that you will not be able to unsee on the internet….they don’t mention that at all….And it’s something you should be aware of, really
JK: [Turns to the camera, gives a thumbs up] Cakefarts.com
M: Cake farts?
JK: Have you ever seen cake farts?
M: What does that mean?
[Awkward silence]
JK: Umm…..cake….cake...
JH: Farting on cake?
M: Farting on cake?

[27:32] JK: It was fluff--it was 10% fluff and 90% filler
M: 9% fluff…
JK: 91% filler
M: Well, 9...90% filler and 1% information
JH: 1% actual information

[32:15] M: Take that, racism!
