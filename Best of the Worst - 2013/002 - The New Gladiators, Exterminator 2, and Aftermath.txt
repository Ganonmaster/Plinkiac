Josh: Hey Jack!
Jack: Hey 
JH: Hey Jack
JK: Hey Josh
[Their names appear on screen]
JH: Hey, how are you--
JK: Wanna watch some movies?
JH: Yeah, why don’t you--yeah [They high five]
[Jack picks up a tape]
JK: This is The New Gladiators...starring Jared Martin and Fred Williamson. “In the year 2072 the world has become a barbaric, computerized wasteland. Waging a ruthless war for the minds of the masses, two huge…” comma [Josh laughs] “global TV networks create increasingly--” well, you have to pause whenever there’s a comma
JH: “Huge….”
Both: [In unison] “global--”
JK: “...TV networks that create increasingly bizarre and violent programming…” oh, so it’s like Running Man. [Continues reading] “In this media spectacular, convicted murderers are given a chance to escape their death sentences by entering into a high-tech fight to the finish in front of the cameras, uh, led by the resourceful Drake (Jared Martin of Westworld and TV’s Dallas) and a towering black warrior (Fred Williamson of M.A.S.H.)” And you might be asking yourself what...what is the genre of The New Gladiators, it’s general [Points to the sticker on the cover, Josh laughs] 

[1:18] JK: What is happening in this scene?
Mike: He’s furiously masturbating
JH: It’s the only way to land the ship

[1:37] M: “You must be Asian” (?)

[1:45] [Two people on motorcycles collide and fall to the ground]
Jay: Oh my god! (...) I want this for ninety minutes
[A man drives his motorcycle right into a brick wall and explodes out of nowhere, everyone laughs]
JH: Oh shit!
M: It exploded somehow!

[1:59] [Introducing the second movie] JH: Well, first off, this is actually sci-fi, genre wise, so instead of just a general film, this is specifically sci-fi, which is good to know. So, as we’ve noted, this is Exterminator 2…
JK: The much-awaited sequel
JH: Yes, and right at the top, “the human fire bomb returns! Robert Ginty, star of the television series The Paper Chase…”
JK: [Shakes his head] Quality
JH: “And Hawaiian Heat...is The Exterminator, a torch-wielding outlaw-vigilante. Mario Van Peebles, son of actor-writer-director Melvin Van Peebles” in case you forgot
JK: [Laughs] I did!
JH: “Together they are dynamite in The Exterminator.” Which is too bad, ‘cause this is The Exterminator 2. “When his brother is fried alive by The Exterminator during a holdup attempt, the satanic X and his gang decide to get even and exterminate The Exterminator. The marauders unleash a campaign of violence and barbarism. They break into an armored car and shoot down the police helicopter that tries to stop them.” This is the whole plot. “As they terrify the populace and start giving orders to the mafia…”
JK: Wait, what?
JH: Apparently they--
JK: The mafia come into this
JH: I know. “It appears they may be invincible until they make one fatal mistake, they cripple the seductive dance--” oh wait, no, sorry, comma, “they cripple the seductive…....dancer who is the girlfriend of The Exterminator. It’s a mistake they quickly regret. In a confrontation of all-consuming fury, the warlords meet their match.” (???) The Exterminator 2

[3:28] J: I love how thugs in movies like this are always...they find it so hysterical whenever they murder people, they’re just constantly laughing
[An old woman gets shot, everyone laughs]

[3:46] Rich: He’s just gonna walk up to people with a flamethrower…
JH: Yeah
R: And burn them?
J: Also, how did he know they were there?
R: It’s so blatant I love it

[4:11] [A man on roller skates picks up a woman and makes off with her]
Josh: Straight up stealing ladies 
(...)
Josh: So what’s the third one, Jack?
Jack: It’s Aftermath
Josh: Oh
Jack: “Three astronauts--” [Looks up]
Josh: That’s--[Laughs]
Jack: Ok. Alright [Leaves]
Josh: Ok cool
[Jack comes back]
Jack: “Three astronauts return from deep space to discover that a worldwide biological and nuclear war has ravaged the Earth
Josh: I hate it when that happens
Jack: “The returning scientists face a dual peril, from mutant cannibals…”
Josh: Hmm-hmm
Jack: “...and from a gang of psychotic killers who control what is left of civilization”
Josh: Fuck!
Jack: “The deranged leader of the gang savagely murders the survivors one by one before becoming the ultimate target of the avenging astronauts”

[5:20] J: He’s trying so hard not to just stare at her boobs right there
JH: Right there!
JK Honestly, they lo--just...just, honey, could you--could you back up a little bit? With the nipe nipes 
[Josh starts giggling]
J: Pfff! The what?
JK: The nipe nipes

[8:49] JK: Very abstract training montage that--it--that has the most effective training method I know, which is strobe lights
J: Yes
JH: There’s lot of strobing in general in this movie
J: Strobe lights and psychological torture. Yeah
JH: Um, which mostly was torture for the audience, I think, more than the actual people in the movie

[11:48] JK: Oh, looks like she’s working on landing that car

[13:39] M: World’s worst stripper consciousness(?)

[14:16] JH: Meanwhile, there’s this drug gang and their plan is to take over the city via...drugs…? I think…? It was…
JK: The simpler way to say this plot synopsis is a man starts murdering people with fire

[15:20] Jack: And he set other people on fire first
Josh: Yes
Jack: He’s the bad guy
Josh: Yeah, we agreed actually that he would have less problems if he set more people on fire
Jack: It’s--it’s--it’s an all-or-nothing kind of thing, either don’t set anyone on fire…
Josh: Or set ALL the people on fire
Jack: All the people, yeah
Jay: The only thing I can say with certainty is that, WE would’ve benefitted more if he set more people on fire
Rich, Josh, and Jack: Yes

[16:30] R: That’s why he builds the world’s silliest death truck at the end [Everyone laughs] He’s got--he’s got--he’s got this--this dump truck, it’s got this little compartment, and this--this machine gun on like a wooden pole, comes out the side, and some strings start pulling the trigger
(...)
JK: It’s like if the kid from Home Alone--[Rich and Josh crack up]--were to build a death truck, like little paint cans with machine guns
JH: Precisely, precisely
J: I--I was just thinking that exact same thing [Jack and him high five]

[17:11] JK: He--he acted the fuck out of that movie. He gave it 100 per--110 percent
J: Yeah. Again, like Never Too Young To Die…
JH: Yeah
J: The movie lights up when he’s on screen, just like Gene Simmons in that, because, uh, The, The Exterminator himself is just a charisma vacuum in this movie
R: If charisma were sugar, he would be Coke Zero
[Crickets chirp for 7 seconds]
J: Yeah, so the guy sucks

[18:32] J: That’s actually the highlight of the movie
JH: The breakdance? Ohh that’s some good stuff
[In the screening room]
JK: Woah, nunchucks?
JH: ‘Cause ladies (?)
JK: Touche
[Mike shakes his head along to the beat]
JH: Also, breakdancing might--might happen at any time
JK: Yeah. Breakdance fighting?
JH: Oh, could be
JK: Or--
JH: See?!
[Jay and Rich laugh]
JK: I can’t believe you just called that!

[20:03] J: I woulda rather watched a movie about the--his garbage truck driver friend picking up ladies at clubs and going out for breakfast [Jay and Josh dance and bounce around in their seats] Like, a whole movie about him. That woulda been great
R: He should’ve been The Exterminator
J: He should’ve been every character in the movie 
JK: He walks into a club and picks up two ladies, not even trying

[20:53] JH: He really has two years (?) to the whole movie, it’s mumbling and yelling
R: Well, there was that one scene with the girl, where he like decided like “maybe, maybe for my career I should try to act” 
JH: There was--yeah!
R: And he starts hamming it up with the girl
JH: She dances, he’s like “oh she’s--she--she’s the best I’ve ever seen!” and like I mean he actually starts acting for just a minute
R: And that was it, that was it for the movie 
Man: You’re getting a standing ovation, here! The crowd--the crowds are on their feet!
R: Maybe that was like the first thing they filmed, then after that he got diagnosed with MS? Is--is that possible?
[Jack looks around, Jay covers his mouth]
JH: [Laughing] Oh god!
R: That would explain everything
JH: Now this movie is the saddest movie. Oh wait, it’s only the second saddest movie
J: Yeah, yeah
JH: Because then we watched Aftermath

[22:19] J: That’s how you know it’s the post-apocalypse, no bras and slightly disheveled ties

[22:40] J: Do you think this movie was an Andy Kaufman prank?

[24:30] J: The tone of this movie completely fucked with my brain

[30:55] JK: I like the spaceship in Aftermath more. More buttons and blinkies and it was a tight little spaceship and, and you know, in New Gladiators the spaceship was just like a big room
JH: Yeah, but no one had to masturbate to set that one down
JK: You’re right, fuck that
