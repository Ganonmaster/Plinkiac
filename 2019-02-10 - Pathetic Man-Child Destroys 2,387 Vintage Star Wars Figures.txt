Mike: Hello, I'm a pathetic manchild. In 2015, I made a video called Welcome Back Star Wars. The video prominently featured vintage Star Wars figures being melted down in acetone, a corrosive substance used in nail polish remover. The video was supposed to symbolize the end of a simpler time in Star Wars and the beginning of a new era: the Disney era. Well friends, this year marks the release of Episode IX, and the conclusion of the so-called Skywalker Trilogy. I, for one, can't wait to see off our beloved characters at the center of this trilogy: Luke, Han, and Leia. So from now until the release of Episode IX, I'll be destroying as many vintage Star Wars figures from the Original Trilogy as possible. I will not stop until every last action figure is wiped off the face of the earth. Doing this, and the conclusion of the Skywalker Trilogy, will hopefully bring me some closure. At least that's what my therapist says. So today, I'll be destroying 2,387 vintage Star Wars figures in a 55-gallon tank filled with an illegal amount of acetone. As these figures dissolve, so will the joy that they brought countless children in the 1970's and 80's children like me. One could say I'm having a literal meltdown.
Rich: Mike...
Mike: Don't fucking touch me! Now, we turn them into a cube. It's done. So much joy. So many memories...has now turned into this. So, I'll see you in our next video where hopefully we'll destroy even more vintage Star Wars action figures in other more therapeutically destructive ways.
Rich: Mike...
Mike: Aughhh!
