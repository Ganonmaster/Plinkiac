[Intro]

Plinkett: Half in the bag! I got problems inside of my brain.

[Enter Plinkett's house. Plinkett is in his favorite chair, reading the newspaper]

Plinkett: Looks like Betty White's gonna die soon.

[Mike and Jay crash through Mr. Plinkett's front door]

Mike: Good morning, Mr. Plinkett!

Jay: We got here early to start our shift. 

Mike: Yeah.

[Mike and Jay open beer bottles in tandem, and take a seat in front of Plinkett's television]

Plinkett: You know I'm paying you two $50 an hour to fix my VCR, not sit around and do nothing all day.

Jay: What are you talking about, Mr. Plinkett? We've made plenty of progress on the VCR.

[Close-up of Plinkett's VCR. It's emitting sparks and smoke.]

Plinkett: Look, the only progress I'm seeing around here is you two yahoos drinking all my beer.

Mike: Now that is a lie. We buy our own beer.

Plinkett: Look, I'm going to the doctor for my weekly brain scan. Now if you two schmucks haven't cleaned up all these beer bottles by the time I get back, I'm gonna fire the both of ya. God nibblets.

[Plinkett exits out his front door]

Jay: Oh, shit.

Mike: That's bad news.

Jay: Yeah, yeah. I don't wanna get fired. Hey, have you seen "Captain America"? 

Mike: I have.

[Scene from "Captain America" plays]

Jay: "Captain America" is Marvel's latest feature-length teaser trailer for "The Avengers" movie, and it's a World War II-era action movie about the origin of Captain America. Mike, what did you think of the movie?

Mike: Um, I thought it was the origin film of Captain America. I enjoyed the first half of the film, and then I hated the second half of the film. And there was lots of things that I did not like about the film. I really wanted to like this movie. What did you think?

Jay: Uh, I had a similar reaction in that I, I went into this movie with really no expectations whatsoever. Uh, I don't know anything about Captain America, and so watching it, the movie starts off really exciting, and really sort of charming. I was so excited to be enjoying a movie, a big movie like this. And then after the origin story sort of wraps up, there's still another 40 minutes, where it's, like, they didn't know what to do.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: And just meanders around for a while.

Mike: Well, unlike you I went into the movie with expectations.

Jay: Hm.

Mike: Because a lot of the more recent superhero movies have not been superhero movies, like "Thor" and the "Green Lantern", and movies like that, where it's like a really kind of off-the-wall character, and we haven't had a movie where there's an actual superhero in a long time.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: Even "Superman Returns" was not a Superman...

Jay [sarcastically]: He's dark and tortured.

Mike: Yeah

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: It was like, okay, I was kind of hoping for the "Let's go get 'em boys!" kind of, like...

Jay: A classic hero. 

Mike: A classic superhero movie. And this one dealt with those themes in the movie, but, and he was a classic superhero, but it, the movie got bogged down on a lot of other things that it didn't need.

[Clip of someone important talking about "Captain America" plays]

Jay: So let's talk a little bit about structure, and specifically the structure of superhero movies. This one sort of falls prey to something that a lot of superhero movies do, which is the first half of the movie is the origin story: setting up the character, learning his backstory, learning how he became the character that he is. And in the second half, it's like they never know what to do with it. It's like, "Oh, shit, we have 30 minutes still to fill, 40 minutes to fill."

Mike: Yeah.

Jay:  "Um...he fights some bad guys." Spider-Man has that problem. Uh, "Batman Begins", "Iron Man"...

Mike: It's, it's the origin story conundrum. "Batman Begins" is a good example because the first half of that is him training, and then the second half is like some hackneyed plot to spray gas all over the city, and then...

Jay: Some, like, schlock plot.

Mike: I think that was the main problem with the film was that the second half of "Captain America" had nothing to do. 

Jay: The, the ending of the movie was, like, came out of nowhere.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: It's like, "Oh, I guess we're at the final action sequence." 

Mike: Well, yeah, when that happened, I was like, "Is this the end? What happened?" "Captain America" feels like a movie that was four hours, and they cut two-and-a-half hours out of it. Captain America and the love interest character, they're like, "Okay, now they're in love." Wait...what happened? When did they have the moment...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...where they kind of, like, realize that they were in love with each other? 

Jay: She's...

Mike: It never happened.

Jay: She's the love interest because she's the girl in the movie. 

Mike: Yeah. And now Red Skeleton's doing this, he has these, he has all these factories all of a sudden, and then, and thenm and then we stop and we take ten minutes to have a scene where Tommy Lee Jones, a minor character, interrogates the, the scientist character, another minor character.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And we already know the information. We know that the scientist guy works for the Red Skeleton, and he knows about this and that, and we know what Tommy Lee Jones is. 

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: But we have to sit there and watch them, and it's like, "We know this information. This isn't interesting."

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And plus we have to watch Tommy Lee Jones eat a steak...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...in, in complete silence, and hear all the squishing, and swallowing sounds. And it's, like, "Why is this scene in the movie? Why is it seven minutes long? And why are we not devoting this time to..."

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: "...Captain America?"

Jay: Well, that scene happen, happens, and then immediately after, it's like, it cuts back to Captain America, and he's like, "Let's go get 'em!" And then it just starts with action, and it's like, it's rushing through everything with the Captain America character.

Mike: Yeah, well, a good note on that would be he, Captain America, kind of takes it into his own hands to go off and save a bunch of, like, POW's.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike:  He comes back, and he's like, "You know, okay, I'm d-, I did that. I'm surrendering myself for disciplinary action." Tommy Lee Jones is like, "No, that's all right." And then, the next scene, uh, Captain America is in, like, a full dress uniform, and he's, like, pointing things out on a map with Tommy Lee Jones, and I'm like, "When did he become a general?" Like, when, when is he making, like, executive decisions like that in the military?

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And it's, like, were there five scenes in between that? And then, it's like, the next scene is like, "Oh, you didn't call me last night." It's like, "Wait a minute, when did these two develop a relationship?" They never did.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And so it felt like all these parts were missing. 

Jay: It becomes what a lot of movies have been this summer. And the first half wasn't like that, which raised my expectations, but then it turns into it, which is a series of things that happen.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: That's all it is. There's no build up. There's no setup and payoff. It's just a series of things that happen.

Mike: Mm-hmm.

Jay: And that's not very compelling.

Mike: No. That's the perfect way to describe it. It, it's, there, there are no, like...they had stakes in the movie. It's like, "Okay, Red Skeleton wants to take over the world." 

Jay: But that's it.

Mike: Yeah. But that's it. I mean, there, there were, there were very obvious themes of, you know, self-sacrifice, being a hero, you know...I mean, it was a very obvious visual metaphor about how strength comes from within.

Jay: Right.

Mike: Um, because he was a weakling in the beginning, and he had the spirit more so than all the other strong guys.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And then there's some, there's a little mini subplot with his best friend character, how they kind of have a role reversal. 

Jay: Hm.

Mike: The best friend character is kind of the, the tough guy. Uh, he's the lady's man. And, and then, of course, Steve Rogers becomes Captain America, and he's strong and fit, and the ladies like him now, and, and the other guy becomes insecure about it. And he kind of dies at the fault of Captain America. He's, he, he picks up a shield, and he's like, "You know, I'm, I could do this, too." The other guy. And he gets killed.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And so Captain America feels guilty about that, and that's pretty much it, as far as characterization. And there's no, like, personal connection between Captain America and Red Skeleton. It's just, like, it's, it's almost bewildering. It, it feels like a script that eight different people wrote, and they solve it...

Jay: That's probably the case.

Mike: And, and it's a shame. 

[Scene from "Captain America" plays]

Mike: Let's move on to just a look of the movie: visual effects, the overall style of the movie, and, um, and how it really kind of failed.

Jay: Well, just from, uh, a, a shooting standpoint, I was really impressed early on with, uh, how traditionally shot the movie was.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: It was shot in a very traditional, competent, not, uh, obnoxious way, like a lot of movies are now. You knew what was happening. You knew where the characters were in relation to each other. Spatial relations. That kind of thing. And I appreciated that. Like, something that just calmed down, and let the movie happen, and let you know where people were. Um, but then the special effects started to take over, and every time there was a big action scene, it looked like "Sky Captain in the World of Tomorrow", where there's the actors in front of a green screen, and then they put 'em into jumping on a train, or jumping away from explosions, and, uh, I was expecting it to be a little more natural as far as, like, stunts, real stunts, real effects, v-, you know, pyrotechnics...um, I was expecting that, and especially because the period that the movie takes place in, it's jarring when those effects, obvious effects, keep cropping up. 

Mike: That is the perfect word: jarring.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: Because the second half of the film was very jarring to me, visually. As well as character.

Jay: Basically, everything falls apart.

Mike: Yeah. Except for action scenes.

Jay: Every aspect of the movie falls apart, except for the fact that you can tell who's punching who.

Mike: Right. Yes. Which doesn't happen in the "Transformers"...

Jay: Mm-hmm.

Mike: Where you don't know who's punching who.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: The first half of the film really worked for me, because they did the propaganda shows about buying war bonds...

Jay: Yeah. And there was even montage sequences that were edited in the way of a montage sequence from an old movie...

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: ...like that, so...

Mike: Like old newsreel...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...kind of thing, and, and that was a lot of fun, and it was, it was really...clever.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: Uh, and the second half of the film, I was really kind of hoping for, like...you were hoping for a really kind of classic action movie...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...um, where Captain America is there with, like, World War II soldiers. Red Skeleton is a nazi. Um, he has current-era Nazi technology tanks and stuff, but he's just really strong and a bad guy and blah blah blah blah blah. But the where the movie kind of went off the rails for me was that glowing power cube of doom...

Jay: Yes.

Mike: ...um, which Red Skeleton, of course, finds the glowing cube of destruction, and, and he has a brilliant scientist who has these advanced futuristic designs that he wants to do, but doesn't have the power to do them, blah blah blah blah blah, resulting in...laser guns.

Jay: And tanks that look like they're from the future.

Mike: And tanks that look like they're from the future, which has nothing to do with glowing power. You could mix styles or visuals, like, but what are those people called..."steampunks"?

Jay: The steampunks.

Mike: Yeah, and something that was period-based...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...that could have been realistically made in 1945.

Jay: Well, that's, yeah, you look at it, and it's, like, there's these giant laser guns and tanks, and they all look like they're from the future, but they're made by World War II-era scientists.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: So why do the weapons look like they're from the future?

Mike: Well, the very nature of the movie does need a sci-fi element, where, you know, there's some serum that turns you into a super soldier.

Jay: Sure.

Mike: But, that's it. The thing I like about "Captain America" is it's a superhero during World War II, and we didn't need technology. We didn't need laser blasts, giant tanks, flying machines that, that...it would have been cool if he was a nazi, and he had, like, 1940's technology kind of weapons, you know, um, but they went the sci-fi route.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And it, just visually, was, uh, a clash. 

[Scene from "Captain America" plays]

Mike: So in keeping with, kind of, the visuals, and the visual style, there's lots of, uh, political correctness in the movie. The, uh, lack of the swastika.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: Uh, lack of, uh, American flags. And then the fact that the Red Skeleton was not a nazi. He was from some sort of offshoot organization called the Hydra.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And, which, technically, were, were from Hitler's Germany, but...

Jay: But it's a way to have your films not have swastikas on 'em through the whole movie. 

Mike: Right.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And then, that's another thing. It's, like, I want to see American flags and swastikas [Mike makes exploding noises and crashes his hands together].

Jay: Classic.

Mike: Classic.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: Classic look. And, and, and a guy with a red skull head in a nazi uniform...it's a cool villain.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And then, I don't think I saw a single swastika in the whole movie.

Jay: I saw one early on.

Mike: Okay.

Jay: I don't remember what part it was, but I remember making a point in my brain that I saw one.

Mike: Yeah. 

Jay: Because I expected to not see one.

Mike: It seemed to take this approach that, like, patriotism or vilifying your enemies was, like, not politically correct.

Jay: Yeah. It felt like it was walking on eggshells...

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: The whole movie.

Mike: Yeah, and Captain America all of a sudden has a racially diverse group of super soldiers that help him. There's, there's an Irish guy, an English guy, a French guy...there is a black guy, and there's a Asian guy...

Jay: Yes.

Mike: ...who has, like, an emo haircut, and, and, and it's, like, "What?"

Jay: The only thing it's missing is someone in a wheelchair.

Mike: R-right, right. Or a woman, a woman...

Jay: Or a woman! There wasn't a woman. 

Mike: There needed to be a Latino woman. 

Jay: It's always a Latino woman.

Mike: Right. Not that there's anything wrong with racial diversity. I am all for it. But this was World War II. I don't think there was even racially integrated troops during World War II, like, where black soldiers fought alongside white soldiers. Like, when they have this, that shot in the forest where all the soldiers were gathering around "Captain America", there was like five or six black guys mixed in in it, and visually it looked like Vietnam...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...to me, because that was kind of the visual style of Vietnam. I mean, black soldiers fought in World War II. They even fought in the Civil War, but they had their own segregated units...

Jay: Mm-hmm.

Mike: ...and, you know, or they were kind of, like, the cooks and stuff like that, and, you know, again, not being racist, but that's historically accurate.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And then there's, like, uh, the Asian guy, and he's like, "I'm from Fresno." And I'm like, "Okay, shouldn't you be in an internment camp?" And when they kind of pander or do things like that in a movie, especially if it's a historical movie, it's offensive to the intellect. To be fair, it wasn't a film about World War II. It was a film that took place in World War II. It wasn't, like, the story of this regiment in World War II. Then, it's like, "Okay, you have to be..."

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: "...accurate." Um, it was a fantasy movie that took place in World War II, so they, there is a bit of a leeway to kind of do stuff like that. But the fact that they feel like they have to is sort of, just, I don't know...the Asian guy with the emo haircut who, who was talking on a cell phone just...threw me out of the movie.

[Scene from "Captain America" plays]

Jay: So, final thoughts. Would you recommend "Captain America", the first Avenger... the Avenger prequel...

Mike: Yeah, I guess so. 

Jay: A begrudging recommendation? 

Mike: For a summer blockbuster-type movie, it's, it's pretty good. It's not horribly offensive or stupid. 

Jay: It's probably the least insulting one I've seen this summer, so I would recommend the movie, too, uh, based solely on the strength of the first half. I thought the first half of the movie was really a lot of fun...

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: ...and really well done.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: And if you were a fan of Captain America, which I don't, I'm not, I don't know anything about Captain America, but if you are, you'll probably get more out of this than we did.

Mike: Yeah, yeah. It's, it's worth the price of admission for a 45-minute long movie that's the first half.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: You can look at the second half as, like, a visual effects reel for future Captain America movies, or just, if you want to shut your brain off and watch dumb action.

Jay: Or just leave the theater and go watch the second half of "Friends with Benefits".

Mike: Oh, yeah.

[Scene from "Captain America" plays]

Mike: So, after seeing "Captain America", we had the urge to revisit "The Rocketeer", which is one of my favorite movies. Ignore the naysayers who say, I mean, cuz the movie flopped. 

Jay: The movie didn't do well, and no one really talks about it much anymore. 

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: And I, I had never seen the whole thing. I had seen bits of it on cable when I was little, so watching it, the whole thing straight through, it felt like, like movie magic.

[Scene from "The Rocketeer" plays]

Mike: I've watched "The Rocketeer" a lot of times, but, uh, revisiting it after seeing "Captain America", a lot of things stood out, most notably that there are scenes that makes sense.

Jay: With a goal.

Mike: With a goal. We were watching it, and there's, there was a scene, like, and it's like, "Okay, the scene starts..."

[Scene from "The Rocketeer" plays] 

Mike: It has characters in it that have things to do, and, and there's information that's given to you that advances the plot. And then it ends. And it's. like. "Oh, that was beautiful. It wasn't just, a thing happened.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: It was, a scene happened. And everything in a movie every little thing should progress the story. And no, no, no fault to Joe Johnson or his direction, I think it's the script. 

Jay: Oh, with the "Captain America" movie? 

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: Absolutely. That's what I'm, like, I've seen before. I was impressed visually with "Captain America", how it's shot very classic and traditional, and you know what's happening. So, yeah, it's, I don't think it's his fault. It's just that it had a script written by, by 25 different people, I'm sure. 

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: All these uncredited writers, and it just becomes a mess. 

Mike: A lot of movies recently are, have been feeling like that. 

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: Like "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull". That felt like 16 people wrote it, and were shoving in things all over the place. And we were discussing "Transformers" before, and, um, and how if you watch the old cartoon show, the toys were thought up first, and essentially the cartoon show was a 30-minute long ad for the toys.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And they've said this on the commentary of Transformers, uh, DVDs, is that, "Yeah, we just wanted to sell toys."

Jay: Right.

Mike: And, and...that's fine. And these movies now just feel, like, "We want to make money."

Jay: Yeah. 

Mike: Wouldn't...

Jay: "We wanna make a...90 minutes of film that is an assembly of things that happen, that we can put into a trailer to get you into the theater to pay your money and watch our film." 

Mike: It's...

Jay: We got it. 

Mike: It's a 90-minute long commercial for itself. It's like a McDonald's cheeseburger. It's imitating a burger.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: It's made of chemicals and, and processed meats.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And, and things that are developed in a laboratory, and looks like a burger, it tastes like a burger, but it's not really a burger. 

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And that's what "Captain America" felt like. Like, it's a movie. It looks like a movie. 

Jay: There's actors in it, and things happen.

Mike: It sounds like a movie.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: But it's not really a movie.

Jay: Right. 

Mike: It resembles one. It very closely resembles a movie.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And, and it's, but it's missing those core ingredients. Um, like a McDonald's hamburger is missing its core ingredient, which is probably real meat. Um, it's also a Joe Johnston directed film.

Jay: From what I understand, that movie is the reason he got the job directing "Captain America"...

Mike: Oh.

Jay: ...was on the strengths of that movie. 

Mike: Okay. Yeah, cuz it's a very similar movie.

Jay: A lot of similarities, and, uh, a good thing to watch for the sake of contrasts as far as story, story structure, scripts, uh, execution...basically everything that fell apart in "Captain America" worked perfectly...

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: ...in "The Rocketeer".

Mike: "The Rocketeer" is, is a simple movie, but it's very effective.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: It has a very solid script, uh, and, and it has a good origin part, and a good second part where the rocketeer has to do stuff...

Jay: Yeah. 

Mike: ...to conclude the plot.

Jay: Well, in what happens in the second part is informed by the first part.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay:  It all, it all congeals into a coherent story...

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: ...that flows. 

Mike: Every character has their specific direction.

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: And it all comes to a, to a point at the end...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...where it's satisfying.

Jay: Things are set up early on in the movie that pay off later. There are things, like, I, I loved that at the ending, he, the rocketeer, defeats the bad guy...

Mike: Mmm.

Jay: ...in a clever way.

Mike: Mm-hmm.

Jay: He has to use his wits, and it's also, he does it in a way that's set up multiple times earlier in the movie.

Mike: Mm-hmm.

Jay: There's the opening bit with the gum on the plane.

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: And he uses the gum to cover the hole in the rocket pack, and at the end he uses that to beat the bad guy.

Mike: Yeah.

[Scene from "The Rocketeer" plays] 

Jay: He's like...

Mike: He didn't just beat him up. 

Jay: He didn't just punch him.

Mike: Or, or shoot him when he begs for, for, for mercy.

Jay: Oh, that's the end of "Transformers", right?

Mike: Yes. You take something like "The Rocketeer", while it doesn't have quite as much action, uh, or visual effects, it's very, it's more entertaining to watch.

Jay: It's more satisfying. 

Mike: It's more satisfying...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: Because everything pays off, every character has clear motivations...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: There's a twist in the end that's interesting, and you care about the rocketeer, and you know what he's trying to do.

Jay: Yes.

Mike: And there's a conclusion. With "Captain America", you don't know what he's trying to do...

Jay: Yeah.

Mike: ...other than stop the bad guy.

Jay: Stop the bad guy. 

Mike: Yeah.

Jay: That's what I think of that movie now, that's all I think of is, "You're bad and I have to stop...you."

Mike: And things are bad when we have to cite "The Rocketeer" as, as complex storytelling.

[Scene from "The Rocketeer" plays] 

Jay: Hey, wasn't there something we were supposed to do? 

Mike: Talk about "Captain America"?

Jay: No, no.

Mike: Drink beer?

Jay: No. Something Plinkett said before he left. 

Mike: Hey, speaking of Plinkett, I think he's coming home right now. I hear his car.

Jay: Oh, shit. We were supposed to clean up all these beer bottles. He said he'd fire us if we didn't.

Mike: Oh, hot damn. You're right.

Jay: What are we gonna do now?

Mike: Um, wait I have an idea. 

[Fast forward a few minutes into the future. There are ten times as many empty beer bottles in the living room.]

Jay: Oh, we did the opposite of what we were supposed to do.

[Outro]
