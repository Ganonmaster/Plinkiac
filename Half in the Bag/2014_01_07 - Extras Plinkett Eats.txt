Plinkett: Half in the bag!
Mike: What would Martin Scorsese say if he walked into this, uh, VCR repair shop, right now? He would say, oh my god, that's fucking disgusting, and he would leave.
Plinkett: Kill me. Please kill me. I don't want the surgery anymore. Just kill me. Oh. There's a tingling in my left arm. It's working, it's working!
