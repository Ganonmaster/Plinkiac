lot more clever about it yeah what do
they want on earth what are they doing
we could do anything what is so
important what's happening so the
question is is this pretty much the same
thing as watching any single
transformers movie yeah I'm having
basically the same reaction as I what if
I was just watching one movie oh my gosh

character yep he's still flipping around
on that Rosie fucking spider look at
this fucking shit what's what's
happening it's just not like I don't
know Optimus Prime has role as sword arm
try everything
he doesn't care who's in the way he's
the the peaceful leader up saying he's
obliterating these on those Jesus Christ
oh my god I'm so surprised like he's
shockingly violent violent murderer and
just rammed their fists through people
two and a half hours
ah in any war there are comms between
the storms there will be days when our
allies turn against us or whatever but
the day will never come when we don't
punch our enemies and tear their faces
off it's a Lincoln Park again is it
