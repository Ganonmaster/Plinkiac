I guess this is a returning it into
Columbo just one more thing mr. sage
something's been bothering about this
man on the horse you say my wife always
hated horses so I know that couldn't be
my death we're talking about just you
know if you could clear this it's my
fault I'm a forgetful type check you're
a great Columbo I live I love Columbo so
hard so hard so much oh do you need to
do an Nvidia graphics test I need to not
click off-screen behavior
have I seen Das Boot directors cuts it's
200 minutes no no I have none no I have
not
I'm not that kind of film nerd so I was
thinking it was dust foot that's what
the 200 minute cutoff joke which is just
dust foot playing eighty times good
peter falk but not enough glass i yeah
mr. Columbo confirmed for police quest -
oh we need to do police quest - soon
yeah well here's the question what do we
do first police quest - where do we
finish undertale
oh you you do want to finish Undertown
Oh as well okay I love it well then we
should finish you know I like the idea
of wrapping something up before starting
something new so if you would like to
finish undertale no no so excited for
daredevil season 2 hope rosario Dawson
has more screen time the Elektra casting
seems well suited unsure about the
Punisher however I did not die are you
unsure about the Punisher Chad Chad Chad
person I like the actor they have in the
Punisher he was in this I don't know I
don't know anything about what they've
cast he was in season wanted to have
Walking Dead and he is really good at
playing an intense creepy guy that kind
of so I like him as the Punisher
he makes perfect since I have not read
who they cast as Elektra and I don't
care to read that I don't yeah i mean
Punishers is is a great nemesis i love
The Punisher as a character he's great
he's alright and he's got his notes but
his notes will clash well with
Daredevils you know mm-hmm so I think I
think it's a good he's a good daredevil
Foyle he's a good daredevil Foyle I'm
looking forward to the night to the new
season
do Columbo from Murder by Death
I hate I I don't I think I think the I
don't I in general don't like the
Punisher just because I think he has one
note he hits one note and then he gets
it he hits it very well he hits it very
well but it gets old
I think he'll work well Reid Reid Garth
Ennis pleasure I know you keep down I'll
get to it I'll get to it but he did both
serious Punisher and then he did dark
comedy Punisher some choose your poison
of Garth eNOS Punisher and read it oh
sure
oh no and like Punisher will especially
play well with what daredevil in the
show because like you know what I need
to say this time I hate Jesus I really
hate Jesus what what what
cuz like the first season of daredevil
was all about him trying to balance like
whether or not he was gonna actually
kill someone right and the Punisher yeah
I'm gonna kill someone the Punisher the
Punishers biggest decision is how I'm
going to tell someone like I'm gonna
kill everyone but do I want to use my
gun my knife don't want to strangle him
so it's it'll he's going to play nice I
the suit looks a little bit better
they had a teaser out a teaser try me
how did they change it it just looks
toned down it doesn't it's it's not as
good as the black suit yep still because
that black suit is so fuckin badass
it looks better
but do do do do do do we know what the
punish is wearing I don't we don't know
what the Punisher is wearing I think oh
now they're gonna fuck around with an
origin story for The Punisher they're
just gonna get right into it we should
be the smart thing in my opinion well
you know they didn't really fuck around
they didn't give kingpin an origin story
like at the beginning they they peppers
fruit yeah so I can only assume they'll
do a similar thing with the Punisher
button but we don't need to see him it's
like a regular guy for the three
episodes hold on you've turned me into
the punish yeah oh god I hope that
doesn't happen they've still never
called them daredevil on the show right
I don't say they have at some point near
the end they just calm like the devil of
somewhere something right oh yeah they
just come the devil like he's not the
daredevil yet the devil of unkown what
are they called again Hell's Kitchen the
devil of Hell's Kitchen
hey you killed Jesus hey rich he'll be
dead he'll be back in three days
yeah oh that black suit fit the series
so well
beer Meister I agree with you that black
suit was the fun level oh oh oh that's a
horrifying visual everyone vomiting so
oh you killed Louie I don't know if you
were supposed to do that tip alert er
you're not refreshing
I
okay friendly bartender says I love it
that Poland found its way into your
conversations on a number of occasions
Poland has it zoo Laos keys possession
more than once my dear dear
so have a big juicy lol fuck my cock
from central Poland or perhaps people
from Poland Thank You friendly bartender
I'm not I'm not sure where Poland has
infiltrated our conversation but we will
accept your tip do
yeah that's true and did you finish
Jessica Jones no they didn't they didn't
really do anything with kilgrave he was
just kind of there yeah they didn't give
him like his own like tragic origin so
well I guess they say they kind of did
but they much like kingpin they peppered
it in throughout the episodes it wasn't
like a it wasn't a dedicating thing they
did well they took their time with their
characters and I like that I do
yeah oh I mean if even if they give the
Punisher back sir because like the
Punisher is his own Oh the Punisher is
his own backstory you know I killed
people because that's the only way to
stop them
a corrupted profile next might be
information how okay lower that and then
let's go into a portal Jim
interesting Oh what did I say security
something security exception
what
hello
No
but
you've sucked for centuries
I have a truth to tell you
you're out the only draft so there are
thousands like you they do not surrender
to Lucifer and fell screaming into hell
but they are stuck all the same perhaps
on a puzzle perhaps on a level you have
destroyed two of the three core files if
you are still resolved I will help you
find third that's some recycling bin
that is their second in there you could
find the pony islands of old versions of
the game that he created and then
discarded search through the discarded
game okay find me a place räikkönen
plays a portal to the final qualifier
yes you fire what what no I don't know
talking they I thought they were talking
about Jessica Jones but I don't quite
understand what's gone there have a good
night Lord Belmont
Lord Belmonts going to get coffee
because he wants to play blood-borne
you know right Colbert that's so right
at all
that's totally for blackness a shimmer
of light we'll rich Evans win any Golden
Globes tonight are the Golden Globes
tonight behold the screen continue I
know what this is
blackness a shimmer of light a bold star
is emblazoned on the dusty no I guess
yet attractive menu appears to beautiful
it's a text adventure
- beautiful ponies accompany the text
Pony Helen the menu button holds such
promise start game says one option says
the other credits say they'll do crits
about your filter one name stands out
among the rest you return to the main
menu with a newfound appreciation for
developers the menu button holds such
promise look yeah I mean should we go to
options yes sure this is great a vast
array of options are displayed before
you and aliasing cheerful facade
advanced RNG free ticket advanced RNG we
had that before then we do it yeah I
want a free ticket
so nice
back it's just our game I guess
well try advance RNG
you click the option it beeps okay but
nothing happens
obscure options that was in the other
whatever wasn't yeah alright well we got
a free ticket ok the menu button holds
such promise start games as one yes oh
oh we have to go into the options mm-hmm
of course we do
what don't you just do exit click on one
of those other folders and the recycle
banner there are other things we could
have done yeah I just happen to have
picked this one first what's um what's
uh just pedal around here a little bit
longer
how do we do what are you trying to try
to make a tiny axe an asterisk
hold on shift yeah I still gonna need
anything I want you to snowman snowman
okay maybe in
purchases
you click the option it beeps but
nothing happens
poni someone saying type in 666
nothing happens
yeah but nothing happened you like it
didn't even say error try some Mills
okay the menu button hold such promises
try exit is there an exit well I don't
know
nope
just start instead of Sergei
yeah something in the options did start
game good miss bolts and I was our typo
maybe
there's something in the options that
were missing that we did not do anti
aliasing or cheerful facade yet so I
will try cheerful facade fix Start menu
Oh or maybe fix dart mania
peeps but what did it - ah yes okay
this is all the stuff we have to do
telegin says rlm should attend Glasgow
Comic Cons Scotland I mean why not also
well best of the worst do an animated
special since you had the Christmas tree
on the last of this probably not why is
everybody so big on us doing an animated
episode I don't know I know you know
what we've talked about this before
works like a lot of our jokes come from
the low production quality yes and
there's only so many things you can say
about animation before you're repeating
the same thing over and over again so
start oh you know like we will probably
have more animated stuff but not just an
animated unless we can find the three oh
it is a well programmed loading screen
it looks very quickly very quickly the
game is loaded and you are a pony a
beautiful son Kate approaches do you
jump shoot or do nothing jump you leap
majestically over that gate but another
gate approaches jump
you clear the gate and land running but
now an enemy approaches oh oh we
definitely shoot lasers pore from your
mouth and fire at the enemy obliterating
it another gate appears oh it looks like
it might be little too far away oh okay
I know to get closer
it looks jump above this we've gotten
here we've gotten to the twist you jump
over it and feel smart for waiting at
all shimmering flag post approaches jump
didn't matter your neck breaks it's okay
you are no longer that Pony an explosion
of confetti announces your success you
gain nine million experience and reach
level 1000 surrender your soul now to
enable graphics that's great that was
great
what was that oh it was the text base
yeah
have you considered doing awful
Christian movies for best of the worst
loving the bad man Left Behind series we
have a couple we want to avoid it I
think you know that would be the smart
call but we've never made this smart
unless it's just there's something
really bizarre or horribly made if it's
just like a bland Christian movie that
says stupid things that first movies say
yeah less interested we have one that we
have one sitting on the shelves and it's
about like rock and roll corrupting a
kid that I hear is pretty good bad yeah
but we're more interested in bad
filmmaking right than just something
that's cheesy maybe
hey I can't tell you how upset I am that
I missed kin and Christmas best of the
worst you should be upset you should be
very upset I watched that episode and
was just livid that I did not see Chuck
Norris oh my god oh this is different oh
my god
lark almost all those Christian movies
are just playing stuff right you know
what I I personally I am interested in
seeing left behind just because just
because of its name really right like
have you ever seen left behind I've seen
it I know the gist I understand what
it's about
yeah
most of the jokes would just end up
being misconstrued as being anti
religious just don't bother that's that
would be the smart choice interest your
soul or supples to play as the pony this
one isn't going to work either
our only option is to keep trying okay
oh I definitely need to do we need to do
an eel bream an evening with bream like
just all meal brain I don't know if we
could handle it to tell you the truth
maybe it's better to dole it out I don't
know we don't plan ahead really so much
to the downfall well it acts me so much
that we don't plan ahead but I
understand it makes perfect sense
what is happening we're in 3d that's
great how much would we have to pay to
get that raw footage of that comedy best
of the work that you guys scrapped
that's a that's a question for Mike and
Jay they hold all the footage my my
guess is quite a bit because it was like
I said it wasn't like there was nothing
controversial or like exceptionally bad
about the edited land he was just boring
so you wouldn't want it because it was
boring all you would see us is like be
frustrated that we can't make jokes at
this it wasn't a comedy episode by the
way we were watching comedies
we weren't never the one of a scrapped
wasn't it I don't remember you know what
it's been too long I don't remember
insert yourself now to upgrade to 4d you
this is it my friend
the last score file get past the daemon
and delete it you scrap to bestest oh
yeah a long I mean a long time ago yeah
how long it was oh it was a while ago
and it wasn't funny or entertaining and
we all knew it
right after we filmed it Mike then tried
to edit it and nothing funny came from
it and so it is gone forever and you
should be happy about that you should be
happy that it's gone forever
beneath the valley of ultra vixens
literally blew my mind
even harder than Double Down ooh Breen
vs. Jesus who wins trick question Breen
is Jesus there's like two Memorial days
ago yeah it was a it was a while ago
might have been two years ago want more
cannon movies that's right now I want
more cannon movie bestsellers so I can
watch them goddamn it
Asmodeus as a motet what if keyboard
okay Asmodeus AS mo de us us yeah
you can't quite convince yourself to
start watching the expanse now say
something disgusting
what no wrong answer for this one say
something disgusting mmm-hmm
say something vile close enough close
enough like I said no wrong answer
you see this is that really dick neutral
or is that the game probably not
probably not probably neither wait typed
that phrase for me I miss it no I don't
know we were distracted we were
distracting his we were distracted by
neutral shenanigans
oh no that's not dick neutral look what
the hell yeah I didn't I didn't think it
would be you think that's the game it's
it's an imposter
no it's an imposter on Steam it's not

goes low lol fuck my cock I think that's
the game fucking with us type that for
cuz you don't you never have that stuff

random friends just took a random friend

the game does I bet I bet I bet I bet I
think it might be right all right go

oh wait it's not up on that why I turn
off okay no it's not I'm hearing no oh
that's okay oh oh we lost
like I said no wrong answer see he came
back but I can say that your concept of
disgust varies gently from mine
did someone hack you just to type a
phrase for me just a phrase just the
phrase infernal prove to me that see
it's the distractors to distract us
today you're still paying it is the game
that's great type that phrase infernal
you know Bernal is that a spell infernal
yeah sure okay that's weird that's great
but now okay I'm gonna keep watching no
matter what apologize to your friend
