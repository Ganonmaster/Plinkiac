this is why you guys like the FaceCam
you like to see a scramble that was a
great save that was that was that was an
amazing save you did it okay one first
thing first things first we are going to
right right Jim be Jam says for both of
you Sara song that everyone seems to
love that you absolutely hate what is it
I'm not really Numa lettuces jack here's
money for eggs I love eggs like I like
bad to the bone does everyone hate bad
to the bone I don't think anyone hates
Ben I like don't fear the reaper or just
the reaper everyone seems to think that
that's a joke song because of one
Saturday Night Live skit yeah okay who's
this
wait this is me you okay so now you hit
the PS button and you go to new you they
thought was that new user
play is a guest well I had a freakout
last time I did that do not sign it
no yep okay now you are guest yeah I I
think I fixed
okay great all right now we're ready to
go
hi okay
no I really like my accountant like I
said he keeps me out of jail by telling
me what taxes to pay which i think is
really important mmm jelly have one for
the free dlc did you only get one map
for them for the new movie mm-hmm this
game is such a fucking ripoff sure is it
sure is Wow Wow the balls on EA games
yep four Maps fresh fucking balls 60
bucks for maps technically five if you
want to include all spaceship maps is
one map because you know they do it
really doesn't matter like what's on the
ground for the spaceship battles right
yeah spaceship okay where do you want to
survive I don't give any shit I survive
on let's survive on Hoth sure
okay press X great
I think I think it worked great
yeah this is this is a tremendous ripoff
of a game they they take DLC to a new
low the DLC is the battle of jakku rich
which takes place before the force
awakens get it together but you can
choose your weapon a lot of good options
a lot of good options this one's
interesting
it's like a it's basically it's like a
one-shot kill but you have to be really
close okay yeah this this is Boba Fett's
gun I hey Han Solo's gun
that's fine how do I make sure I'm in
vertigo I have no no idea on hands you
know you can choose different things
probably hit the pause button or the
options button the graphics in this game
are like shaking keys in front of a
small child sure it's distracting but
how long can you really be invested in
it that's exactly the game looks great
well I will read things when I'm done
playing game yeah it looks great and it
plays fine
the problem is there's just no there's
no meets there there's no you know what
there's meat but there's no potatoes
alright oh oh settings then Washington I
press up Wow
you good yeah you're in the bottom okay
I'm on the top riches on the bottom and
it's waves it's just waves we have to
just kill all the guys that sounds kind
of boring yeah but you know you see if
you can make it all the way I think you
just kind of hang out here are the wait
they're behind us no no yep
great I got him
okay did you get yours mine what did you
think
I felt one guy great I killed three and
then I got hit a few times by this laser
cannon so I backed up oh nice
just being smart Jack I'm not smart I
just I just stand in the middle here and
shoot I'm not smart about things I have
I don't have a rapid-fire round around
so I'll probably ride do you remember
that from the movie oh I fucking hate
controller controller aiming yeah okay
oh so also are one the the right bumper
is your grenade yeah and then l1 is you
get like you get your Bacchus bow okay
but only for one shot one shot one shot
so it's an amazing shot ah maybe I
actually have no idea claim the pod
there's a pod I don't know you gotta
claim the pod was the positive Star Wars
thing I don't know her
where's the pod oh it's over here thing
the pod
let's go get that fucking pod there it
is claiming average can you claim those
pods say we got the pot now we got to
defend ourselves
we did it we got to defend the pod now
right yeah I'm right by the pot right
the frame the pod I'm just gonna shoot
it the guys that walk out why does that
need
elaboration Jack I need some extra
context cuz just shooting at the context
is defend the pot because shooting at
the guys might get boring rich don't you
think so you think that just shooting
guys might get boring without extra
context I've played a little bit of a
Star Wars game and you know what
shooting at the guys gets a little
boring a Jedi Knight so Mikey
Johnny your Hulk ass sequel
gonna flank him no not where are they oh
you got him already
great you did it yeah yeah I don't need
your help check you think I need you I
thought you might have just appreciated
my help
I shot that guy in the kneecaps you know
why a fucking bad-ass or just a prick
possibly break but close the door it's
cold in here
both of us are it's hot why is that door
open right run barking Admiral Armour oh
oh shit what's that 80s seas do we need
health sure all right wide open but what
if it's a waste what if we don't need it
it'll always help extra life oh my god
they're our lives we got lives
I guess where's that 80s day I got a
rocket launcher oh good he's at the door
no not the bow
oh that really helped wow that's a check
shit no it's really helped look at his
life where's this life at on top of them
you took out most of his life you did it
I didn't see anything that said anything
about life it was a little bar on top of
it was I'll have to take your word for
it it was a little bar on top of his
head
you did it rich you saved the galaxy oh
there's another pod okay okay get to
claim the pilot I don't know what I'm
doing there's a white thing on the thing
and follow the thing nope not this way
here is climb the pod got to climb the
pod that sounded a little rain man ask
definitely definitely gotta clean the
pod definitely gotta clean the pod all
right we got the pot the pot is claimed
I'm gonna blow some shit up
where they are the other there over on
this side a little bit
and now that I'm fair
can we just like have Admiral Ackbar
speak through an interpreter because I
hate listening to him what are you
talking about
I'm a great specialist Roger except for
my lack of understanding or I don't know
I lost my nice my Greg I I don't bother
my god that's option shit shit it was a
trap I set down a turret back here where
I am oh great
we're dead behind you
what behind me there's nothing behind me
yeah they're up here oh shit they got a
jet pack oh I got it what's this what's
this again
Tara what did you get I got a proximity
bullshit this Oh what are those
proximity bullshit well ever again
I'm gonna put here in case of Walker
comes out no that's you don't shoot my
partner
punch you in the dick
serpentine and motherfucker get out of
here great too easy you know we I mean
we're playing on normal
what's even get this sounds fancy a
vehicle Turin tactic of where you at huh
where you at oh I went I went to where
the old pod was we have to go to the new
pot now I'm gonna put my vehicle turret
down okay new pod go go run to the new
pod rich run to the whole pod so I can
get drops or something there well
there's one more drop left at the old
pod not the old pod the first pod
do it rich you can do it I believe in
you may the force be with you
and with and also with you you okay
yeah did you get him did you get all the
bad guys you guys shoot them the bad
guys rich you know why yeah away from me
Jack I'm going towards the good stuff
we're getting split up and that's bad
that's true you know what bad means nope
let's lay down in a proximity reminder
right right here I don't even know what
I have great you oh you have a bomb
I guess just a bomb I guess I have no I
don't know either rich how do you tell
the difference in Star Wars how do you
tell there's who that like a power
coupling or uh right I laid down a
couple proximity was that one of Star
Wars what is that there's Star Wars in
them and yeah there's a Power Star no
that was a Death Star rich get it
together they're saying I have a shield
oh well then there you go that sounds
fantastic great where did you get you
got a shit where I saw the bad guys is
there another like this is there a pod
dude he got Jack Jack I've got a bad
feeling about this I said the thing did
you say anything from something from
Star Wars okay oh hey there oh there's
an invisible guy did you see that guy
yeah I just shot him bunch times he was
invisible
it was inadvisable where they have where
they ever
check your math up writer yeah your
turns girls can't shoot my turret bitch
but bitch oh oh there's a new treat no
that's fine that's fine I'll go get that
treat I'll be back I'll be right back
we're not splitting up by following her
okay okay I'll be right back I'm gonna
pick up the new treat that's one that's
130 of them come out the door next to me
Oh another proximity bomb let's go back
out into that wide open area with no
cover
that seems oh yeah that seems like a
smart idea it's been working great
boom proximity bomb where's everybody
did we win nope we didn't did we Star
Wars I think so
did we Star Wars at least I think we
start wars great no there's still guys
there's still at least four star wars
left rich you find the Star Wars I'm
gonna run over here oh okay you know why
there's thing there's the thing and
obliterate iron I'm running towards it
that's what you do it's got a help on it
and help this good okay I got all the
Star Wars we're doing great with the
hearts we got we have four hearts and we
used to have two hearts so I think we're
doing great
ooh pod oh we have to go outside for the
pod Ridge that sounds a bad idea too bad
we're doing it of course they're getting
things that said charge what does that
mean all right we got the pod there's
security the area around the scape pod
that sounds good great I have I have a
big gun I have a big gun rich and I'm
gonna shoot people with it this is my
plane at least you got that door covered
I got the store covered I'm gonna I have
the big door covered because I have this
big gun so I'm gonna shoot people with
my big gun it's gonna be fucking awesome
no one's coming out my dorm they're
coming out your door they're not going
out my doors I grenaded him
why aren't they coming out my door they
don't like you well maybe they know like
the big gun is proclaiming their radar I
can see there they exist that way yeah
yeah
I'm waiting for them to come out I'm
baiting them yeah I thought you you yeah
I'm I'm over that way don't shoot me
oh damn it they're coming out this
little door again are they all just
funneling out that little door cuz they
don't want to face me and my big gun
well that would be the smart thing I'll
kill all the guys you just do nothing
okay
yeah well I'll make them come on your
door by proving that you know over there
is too dangerous
where'd you go did you go in yeah you
went where all the bad guys are I want
to shoot bad guys yeah I guess that's
what my Johnny's got to shield yeah I
dropped my shield there's three enemies
left rich three enemies left
we got super dupes we got here orbital
strike proximity bomb I got an orbital
strength that sounds awesome it sounds a
lot more awesome than my proximity bomb
I like proximity bombs because then you
can like lay traps
really I hit that guy like 20 20 times
another shield yeah
I'm behind you well no not you there
dickhead with the cloaking device what
the Han Solo gummy yeah yeah is that
what you're using I think so
looks enough like it yeah you know what
and when I play online a lot of people
use the Han Solo gun because it's really
good but that's one that you have to
earn like you're playing and shit yeah
preparing for next wave I'm gonna stand
here because I have an orbital strike
and I cannot only use that outside
that's okay that one someone pass my
persimmon mine a big day so that's good
great so if they come from outside I got
them oh shit they're coming from inside
you got over there yeah
great I love that we're working as team
ok I got a couple inside I'm moving in
move in okay I'm moving in this oh I see
him over here
sniping I did I can't believe I hit him
from that far away two enemies left two
enemies left they're coming in at your
20 my what the fuck does that mean
they're coming it's Roger they're there
over and out
I got one more and Star Wars god damn it
what they were there they were just that
so god damn it I'm sorry okay I really
want to use my orbital strike
I really hope someone comes outside
girls this is AI or Elsa I got the most
useless power I don't want to be outside
when you use that I'm gonna hang it out
in here okay that's it you know what
that sounds like a good idea I don't
think they're coming out I think they're
coming from inside again I think these
guys are smart where they say you know
what they could call orbital strikes
okay we're all in here well shit
oh my god they're all in there yep
you're one
your lady keeps talking to me oh that's
you I'm sorry no that wasn't you they
looked just like you

that's outside all right I'll grab them
whatever this is this discharge I know
what it does but I'm picking it up okay
I'm gonna get this dry pod give me an
outside enemy oh good
a TST one will strike that bitch where

to not to my knowledge
it could be Ethel under Boba Fett's mask
we don't know maybe Ethel you know gave
up her job as a hunter and became a
bounty hunter
so we can't be on the same side in
battles we can not be on the same side
metals no chat we cannot be on the same
side we can not be on the same side of
battles so which would you prefer
yeah okay oh you get to be a hero yeah
apparently nothing to be hero I'd rather
I never got a chance to be hotter Luke

the raloo Bloods but it was kind of
quick okay then I'm gonna be bad I never

near you you have to be near me yeah we
gonna happen I'm lightning might have
been
thank you
anonymous says I don't have anything to
say I just wanted to see your face close
up as you read this
and citizen one one eight has some very
sarcastic remarks about us playing Star
Wars Battlefront 2015 brought to you by
dice games in eh ok you know there
there's some so far in playing the game
and I'm not you know I don't have too
many hours in but here's what I'm gonna
say is there is some dumb fun to be had
in Star Wars Battlefront and that's it
there's no there's no substance which I
get it shouldn't be a surprise like it's
not a surprise
and I remember you have to find some
humans yeah yeah they're not human I'm
just gonna consider them observant of
opportunity oh yeah yeah yeah obviously
you have to destroy enough to win anyway
easy pickings rich easy easy picture you
could share this event don't shoot
I'm sure what huh a little thing cop
popped up and said oh you got a kill you
could share this event what
I'm sorry what
I got a transport ship but a lot of
people are attacking rich you might want
to go to Finland that gets the extra
point where am I want to shoot this guy
or you want a Jew deck I mean you know
either way you do you rich well and then
that was destroyed so you know
congratulations you've destroyed it and
the Empire's hope for victory in this
particular battle oh you can't get away
from rich Evans that easy or maybe you
can't
no no he's oh yeah nice you actually did
not get a kill you didn't get the kill
him someone else got the killer so you
know you did the work co-op whoo nice
beautiful affair I really thought you're
gonna eat it there for a second
whoo that's a crash
Aisling universe
nice maneuvers doctor crash
rich stay on target stay on target it's
like what they said in the movie
this makes my head spin along dammit
Black Hawk Down so now their supply ship
is leaving and you want it looks like
people are doing a pretty good job
killing it but you want to make sure
that that dies - that could yes all
right I just probably people up yeah I'm
just you know I want to make sure you're
playing the game to its fullest I want
dirty fights Jack are you playing this
on hard cuz that's the only one who'd
enjoy it on his fullest your son bitch
Jack it's true it's true
I'm quite the son of a bitch son of a
bitch yes how can I help you I didn't do
it's not a ski to bed dad how much to
shut you up how much how much to shut me
up us eat of adapter Pow Wow whose do
for free I guess you're still on your
emperor palpatine high is that what you
know yeah yeah defeating defeating you
in open combat after I slaughtered you
as Luke Skywalker defeating you with an
obviously overpowered character was
really satisfying
you I didn't keep remembering the
postman that seems you know how we wash
that the oh that's right you were
watching the postman I think that's I
think that's wonderful
I'm having a shitty round you know
you're just getting your wings back but
you guys are ahead now so that's
something oh no yes get him rich Sikkim
oh that's the Falcon rich you've got to
kill the Falcon l1 is a boost by the way
I can't I can't
oh my god you right now cuz Richard
battled nice fucking kill that Falcon
fucking kill him
oh well they got you back yeah
oh wow you know a couple teacups you
know what come with me hooks that is a
good question what gobbledygook has
asked us a very important question yeah
where were I am particularly making fun
of this game because it has no substance
yeah
but as gobbledygook points out you and I
both love rock Utley mmm which other
than pure gameplay has no substance but
here is the big difference cavity hooks
the substance of rocket League is the
gameplay yep
and part of that pie though I think part
of what's lacking in Star Wars
Battlefront is how big the battles are
also the cheapness of EA let's talk
about that the startling Mapfre you get
in this $60 game versus rocket League
which is like 20 you know this is the
thing but beyond that if you just look
at the pure gameplay I think I think a
lot of it has to do with the size of the
maps a lot of these games are 20 V 20
how many are in it like even here is 10
vs 10 it's huge and that's a lot of
chaos even playing like a 4 V 4 match in
rocket League isn't as satisfying as a
three versus three you know like look at
how many people are on are playing this
which means like the chance for random
death is very high and when you get
random deaths when you get caught in the
crossfire that makes it that makes not a
good time and so rocket League gives us
immense substance through its gameplay
so what's on the ground I want to be the
Falconer
yeah those those things are the ones you
want to pick up be able to pair yeah
it's it's something that'll look like
that or maybe it looks like a fuckin
animal
it'll be stuff like whoa what happened
that's some fancy piloting jack
apparently already long one fucking hell
great that's great that's fuckin great
do you know what happened to ya guys
shot of it okay well there you go
those things reduce your cooldown time
for like your rocket and the shield yeah
yeah I'm looking for a pillow
shouldn't it be like 20 titers versus
five x-wings right well this is yeah
this is the thing like rocket League has
a ton of DLC
but all of it is cosmetic yeah you know
you don't need their DLC to enjoy the
game you're looking for you're looking
for entire fighters now yeah yeah or you
know it's it's tough it's tough to
compare but to for me what kills this
game a lot is the chaos there's just so
much nonsense there's so much that I'm
not in control of as a player that it
makes it it makes it very frustrating
and not fun for me
whereas in rocket League if an opponent
makes an amazing play like I'll see that
I might still lose but I'll respect them
like for Nia doing a backflip double off
the wall bounce it's like oh my god that
was amazing I can't believe we did that
here I just happened to bump into
someone and they shot first you know
it's it's it's I guess very similar to
war but it's it's chaos
most everyone I probably get into rocket
League has gotten internally randomly to
my family over Thanksgiving at first
everyone grown because they thought I
was being antisocial but as soon as I
was about halfway through one match
everyone was fighting over the
controller yeah well rocket League has
has an incredible ease of access I knew
everyone knows how to play rocket League
right away but I I even think with that
with this game this game has a pretty
low ease of access where anyone can pick
this up and basically get what they're
doing and it's Star Wars and people like
Star Wars in general say this is this
was made to be a casual game but it
looks like something it looks like
something of more substance
whoa get that slave one
I remember you do have that yeah she did
it rich you're doing it no you didn't do
a rich fuck any good arcade shooter has
a higher time to kill okay
that was bad well that was really bad
that happens that happens and you know
like I I'm not I'm not making my final
judgement yet because I would like to
get a little more comfortable with it I
do think like a lot of these games do
require you to know the map you know and
I think that's actually part of the
problem is games like this favor people
who have been playing it longer
regardless of skill the more you play it
the better weapons you can get the more
you play it the more you know the maps
and that means newer players are gonna
get frustrated I think right leg
actually has halfway decent matchmaking
I'm sure I don't know yeah I don't know
about matchmaking here but it's tough
it's tough when you go up against
someone who has a better gun who knows
the map and knows where to jump yeah
I've had some fun playing battlefront
and I don't want to speak entirely ill
of it it it's lazy it's it's you know
what it is it's running around with your
friends with laser gun pistols now you
got me how you got me you're dead no I'm
not dead you're dead it's that bitch it
had to be a lot of fun I don't but it's
not meant to be a hundred percent
discouraging it can be a lot of fun but
I don't think it can be fun for very
long nope you gotta want it rich you
gotta want it
whoa
look missile lock
it's gonna be how fast you can learn
about well the big maps the big maps cuz
they have to accommodate a lot of
players and I think there are some
multiplayer online games that have that
whose map design is a little more
intuitive
that's this is the thing this is
Battlefront 2 with less content it's I
don't know I so far I think it's real
fun in short bursts cooldowns refresh
faster you did it but there's just too
much chaos
whoa
you're picking up rebels rich all over
the place what are you doing I'm dodging
you can do it may the force be with you
oh that's not gonna help
nope you need vehicle okay that's good I
go kick some rebel ass nope too fast eh
I don't care
the Dark Lord got you is that was just
the dark one
shut up egg we shut the fuck up and
never talk again never ever talk again
you know it does look amazing I think
you know a big problem I've been having
is beside been what I've been trying to
do is play some of the smaller maps
there are there are some some smaller
ones where it's just like eight versus
eight or or 12 versus 12 teams instead
it's like the big 20 versus 20 but then
I've been having a problem with people
playing the objectives and that's that's
the problem for multiplayer gaming in
general he's like just finding people to
play with that aren't fucking around and
that's a huge problem in the 20 versus
20 Maps I think I hate nasty free as I
was playing one of those like stop the
Imperial Walker ones and and just no one
was going to the objective and every
time I tried to run their dire this game
is more frustrating than fun at times
oh you got to feed it yeah yeah I know I
did
thank you Richard got defeated why are
you so mean
Oh Oh on a scale of one to ten how aware
are you that the title of this dream is
ballet isola France ten it was it was a
typo that I knew I made but I just did
it quickly so I know it's name Bella
Ethel bolt or bowel tool fund I
incorrectly titled it and I decided
fuck it I'm just gonna incorrectly title
one more of these that I want to do the
SPS FPS thing and I'm done
play against like like I wanted to
Walker battle thing again oh sure sure
here okay I'm the granted on the ground
on the ground okay run uh yes
I have seen one punch man it's cute is
that a cartoon it is an anime thought
that we're just making it is this recent
it's out it is out I've been I've been
reading the comics and the the show is
pretty close to the comics it's it's fun
um it's a little there's a trope before
what feels like younger writers where
the hero is really amazing at something
but just so bored with it all you know
and that's basically one punch man
you're the good guys
you're fighting Tie Fighters it's gonna
keep throwing me off jack I don't know
why well yeah you'll get you get into
the zone and so like that's his whole
shtick is you know he he's super strong
but he's just so bored with it all and
I'm kind of tired of that trope in
general or I'm just not in the mood for
it right now so I haven't been watching
it a lot but it's cute I like I like the
art style a lot that's my official one
punch man talk that's all I got
can we play rocket League nah no one
punch man is a really young writer yeah
I I would have I know nothing about who
wrote it but I would assume that he's a
really young writer and the the ego the
ego of that trope is what is what kind
of annoys me about it is cuz that's what
he's projecting like I am so good at
things that I'm just so bored
oh I'm sure it gets better but you can't
find anybody to fucking shoot at Jack oh
I fucking the eyes game you got killed
by Thai fighter I fucking hate this game
yeah
you can do it rich oh you got him you
got him you got him you get you you got
yeah I know I did I know I didn't do did
that rich these Imperial bastards are
gonna pay they killed your mother and
father no wait
they are your mother and father dun dun
dun what is the swindle stream gonna be
on YouTube soon rich I I don't know much
but it'll be going up eventually yeah we
go it goes up everything goes well it
goes up eventually I don't know if it's
coming up in the next couple days or
anything second time I got crashed into
by the fucking AI yeah rich just kind of
a few so we'll have some more some fresh
cut up streams tomorrow swindle is is a
tough game to get into a beefcake but I
really enjoy it I'm on the I'm in the
second-to-last level now and there's
some fun stuff
damnit heads up homing missiles ah what
was that about mother and father I don't
know I'm getting to that point in the
night where I'm just saying things in
order to save them just I'm just I'm
just saying things I have no control up
just finish the battle you're gonna win
just finish the battle and then we go do
your ground battle you can do we don't
have to do the ground battle it's you
know what it's fucking fine well I want
I want you to do the ground battle area
I want you to feel my frustration the
here's here's the if I'm gonna put on
some artsy-fartsy pants if you're okay
with that yeah go ahead
fancy pants might know artsy-fartsy
pants so you know like the the best
games have this way of like melding
gameplay in with theming right and so
what is war right now you get five kills
no congratulate I got better than my
deaths be with apparently be with me
here yeah
war is is full of pain death and
suffering yeah but someone makes a lot
of money from it
yeah so in that aspect EA and dice have
successfully intertwined theming of
gameplay suffering death and misery yet
someone's making a lot of money from him
which do you do whatever you want I'm
gonna have a decent match fucking match
I thought I think that's a missile so
here EA has has made us all feel the
pains of war I think I think that's what
I'm going that so I'm sticking with and
so I'm sticking with everybody
those are my okay so you're fighting the
rebels now yeah you can do a wrench I
believe in
jack has been getting things right
tonight right war war never changes
right
and it's there's some there's so much
there's so much theming and you know the
the constant death cycle and it gets to
the point where you don't even care who
you're shooting it anymore you just want
someone else hey I haven't even seen one
human animal yet like in my sights nasty
free I think has it out for you yeah you
know what tear tear tear both my eyes
out I don't know if you're being ironic
or not but I do really enjoy the sound
of the TIE fighter I think it's you know
it's neat and it's it's it kind of gets
you in the right headspace what
whoa
fuck
and I looks great I love all the clouds
you know you're up there and can't
really see what you're doing it's great
there's a lot of great yep nasty free Oh
free Disney is making all the money
yay just flipped the absurd bill they
spent to have this where you know
someone's making money off of this I
think a lot of people I probably may get
money out of this
I don't all right your homing missiles
anyway
I'm football there's football today rich
there's many footballs today yeah their
footing there balling
sometimes they're doing it at the same
time most often first they foot then
they ball then they put a little bit
more only the best bar yep
there's take they take 58,000 hits I
take four well this is the thing there's
nothing there there's nothing you can do
this game makes you feel helpless isn't
that all multiplayer shooters these days
them no I still think there are it's
different from Call of Duty
well Call of Duty I think is it is a
poor example of a good multiplayer
shooter I think there are good
multiplayer shooters I just don't think
this is one of them I think this is
chaos there's no balance I think a good
multiplayer shooter needs balance are
you just quitting yeah are you just
quitting yeah you can't quit war I just
did you I just did Jeff Ward never quits
you rich we you know what world would be
a better place if we all just quit war I
guess you're right I guess you're right
right sorry I did this once that I've
done look at 20 V 20 Walker assault okay
so in Walker so there is the the
Imperial Walker the 8080 right and if
you're on the bad guy team you have to
shoot the other guys and if you're on
the good guy team you have to shoot the
other guys that's it
Jack I'm thinking about standing is
starting to stand-up comedy any tips
that you could give how does one how
does it suck to mom how did you write
your jokes you know writing jokes is
easy you just think of stuff you want to
say and then string it together so if
you activate the uplink stations you
call in airstrikes okay
and that's important you write okay say
it and I just kind of hang out and make
sure nobody deactivates it it might be
easy well maybe except for here they
come
yep you just write your jokes and I like
I would try to write them in chunks like
oh these are all jokes about this and
this is how this leads into the next
joke and this is how it leads into the
next joke and there's no key to not
bombing just got to do it I just gotta
keep writing and keep going out there
and eventually you figure out what works
that's about it
yep well you got it you got one plane
out and that's good did it I mean you
didn't do anything but your team did it
so that's good
listen back over any further nope nope
come on oh wait no who's about to walk
right into yep say yeah or you could
just go around and shoot other guys like
cuz none of it really matters he's dead
rich he's already dead
it can't be get it off that's not a
thing that can happen
nice nice you did that rich
well which I think there might be a
guide to right now he's anything okay go
get that up
uplink activated or help your friend do
it okay go ahead
now press the square now hold it hold it
oh you died oh that guy had a smart idea
putting them up nope not that smart cuz
he died oh you're right fidgety Jones
watch out for enemy units that's really
unnecessary orders like of course watch
out for enemy units watch it watch out
his stormtroopers rich if you didn't
know you're supposed to do that
give your booboo back in it
see if you can activate that other guy
dr. berty right your rich guy there I
hate shooters with controllers so so
much this is out on PC so much I'm not
spending $60 for this nope that's
probably smart rubrics proximity bomb
those are fun where's the uplink did we
uplink the uplinks huh word the uplink
scold are we done with that oh yeah now
you have to shoot at the bottom of the
8080
look just a proximity mine out there all
right do something
okay new up links new up links ready to
go activate that motherfucker
defend that motherfucker get that
motherfucking going no I'm saying you
know I'm saying
dude it's a dancer cuz it's a star wars
in the stars
stormtroopers shoot him in the dick
shoot him oh he's your friend shot him
in the dick whoa whoa what'd I do
I don't think that was you get out of
there
what is this thing in my hand yeah oh
fuck I don't I don't necessarily know
what that was
Oh Jack Jack Jack is only positive and
that is good I you know I am positive in
most things I like positivity being
positive feeling good feeling happy
feeling strong feeling sexy sometimes
you know not necessarily right now but
you know in general Oh fuck's sake
caught in the fucking crevice I hate
everything about this everything uh-huh
every single aspect of this I hate now
let's assume for a second yeah because I
know you are just not a fan of like
controllers yeah
let's assume for a second that you're
playing this with a mouse and keyboard
yeah I'd still hate it yeah and I think
you would I just wanted you know Star
Wars he's camping yep he knows what's up
okay you know where he is shooting with
a dick
oh no oh no I mean I'm gonna do this one
this is a terrible gun let's see here
Star Wars justice system this is a Star
Wars this is the Stars nope great all
right here we go
so this this gun is does really great at
close range it light it's like a
basically a one-shot kill at close range
but you got to get up there yeah
and so that's why I like it just forces
you to get in there that's what I'm
gonna do here I see that stormtrooper
over there
I throw a grenade might have killed
someone who might a matter I don't know
probably didn't huh all right let's go
let's get in there sometimes in a game
rich you just got to get in there yeah
you know saying
as a homing shot all right here we go
get it get in there not in there
obviously maybe dick I thought I was
gonna get him I didn't go alright
alright try again
getting in marriage getting in there our
goal is to get in this base over here
and and get our uplink back we need our
uplink back get up there you dick okay
ready and great shit he threw grenades
too and again alright here we go
doing it again heading over there
there's a thing I think I won kit every
single time I get caught on that thing
ooh a rocket launcher oh yeah I saw your
grenades this time you dick
stop shooting grenades I think one vs.
20 was probably not the best one versus
20 yeah what do you mean there's like
three other men there's I know I know
they've all got like super fancy jet
packs yep yeah that happens
that happens and I know what everybody's
saying now like you know stop trying to
do the same thing over and over again
but what else am I supposed to fucking
fuck got caught on a rock stupid you
know I guess I could go to the other one
but I'll do it'll just be the same thing
get out of my fucking way it's very
disheartening this game dude
did you the Star Wars Tsar orbital
strike incoming get out of there okay
come on Star Wars
we dodged that shit yep
does anybody get a better get back other
than the Imperials yeah no you can get a
do-it that's a thing you can buy later
if you if you are good enough at the
game you can buy a jet pack later
oh so this is one of those unbalanced
this is one of those if you play the
game then you get better things say
something that will save your life
someday
if you ever seen an erratic driver
rather than speeding up to get ahead of
them just just let them go far ahead of
you because you have no control over
what they do behind you they could rear
end you into traffic make it like push
you out into an intersection but in the
car people will know somebody you like
on the road look with their across they
just wanted to get ahead of them and get
away from you yep I I would say stay far
back go ahead
absolutely you you don't you want to get
as far away from them as possible and
and the easiest way to do that is just
to slow down that is actually a really
good advice rich oh and also on the road
always expect somebody else to do
something stupid
utterly fucking stupid yeah I was
driving home it was pretty late at night
is like midnight or something like that
and the streets were pretty much really
it was normally a big Street 159th
Street and I got this green light I'm
going through and this guy he got a clue
you know he definitely had a reg read it
I had to slam on my brakes not to not
the t-bone and kill him and probably
myself so I always expect people to do
something stupid never assume that
somebody's gonna do the smart thing on
the road hmm that's that's that that
might save your life someday
I like that slow down one that's that's
a good advice rich
I think that's smart advice shots come
from
yeah I'm gonna make that guy's day bad
yecchh I didn't get him someone else got
him
I don't whatever that sound was I don't
like it that's a boba fett I think
flying around good I don't know what
we're do what disconnected what one
woman he wasn't there hey rocket bad guy
all those backpacks just looking noxious
is that one of those things where
everybody who plays his game she's gonna
use those then at some point right when
they're when everybody has them unlocked
yeah yes that's not Star Wars game
everybody has a backpack the game whoo
oh shit don't die I have an orbital
thing when's the new doom come out
that's what I wanted a new dude yeah I
don't know shit about shit man
oh this is the game this is the big game
and I've it like I think I think there
is some good in the smaller maps but
this is this is what 2320 is you know
there's just nothing here nothing here
but garbage oh I don't know the maps are
not good at the game and I hate using a
controller the flying section though
that's all I made by the native average
ish ish except for that one fucker kept
shooting me all the time just want to
use my orbital strike let me just use my
fucking orbital strike
nope nope well that was stretch it's
fine it's fine everything's fine I just
let me use my orbital strike to burn
some people alive and everything will be
great this guy hasn't died everyone else
dies this fat hasn't died he just hangs
back here he's a dickhead but he's not
dead
said who is doing what okay here we go
is there anybody gonna shoot you're just
picking a random spot in the van all the
walkers Walker ready huh let's see what
happens
does that hurt the walkers maybe I don't
hear why wouldn't it hurt the walkers
sudden walking targeting no party they
look great I just like this game
sometimes yeah yeah and by sometimes I
mean most of the times I just like it
right now there you go
wait here's the thing oh that guy took
it oh and just dead what the one what
what do you want what do you want from
me game I know somebody in the stream is
saying we saved them $60 yes that's
exactly what you should be saying to
yourself
what
do not buy this game it will hurt you it
will hurt your feelings
okay what is this
Oh someone on
oh that's pretty what happened to that
one stormtrooper oh sure he probably
turned into that guy
Wow that doesn't seem to be doing much
good at all
fuck this game fuck everything about
this game so I hit him a bunch of times
with my laser and he rams into me and
you know he doesn't explode and I do
revs into you but you do Wow yep great
everything's everything about this game
is great but rich isn't it great because
of Star Wars no it's not is in Star Wars
what else do you expect when you run
into another ship
I expect the other ship to blow up too I
think it would be neat if the other ship
blew especially when he spent five
minutes shooting it remember when I was
shooting at the ship that was fun
run getter run kid run rocks rock
nothing matters we lost great that's
great that's a lot of deaths now rich
yeah
not rich yeah we got we got time
we got time for more mm-hmm get out of
here get out of here okay the heroes one
was kind of fun the heroes one was kind
of fun here's something I would like you
to try them yeah just to make sure we go
to just comparison and remember to flip
to the inversion because I flipped it
yep 20 V 20 is stupid
yeah it's the worst so go down go over
and down to quit nope or control yeah
okay quit yes you're sure
this game sucks Larry what you want to
go for you want me to go I'll show I
will show you I want to say it's Oblast
I think No oh yeah blast is 10v ten it's
the exact same as other games but just
10 vs 10 it's a very different
experience it's not as chaotic Bo rich
it's because we don't understand how to
play the game that's why we think it
says I think it's sex because I have
always hated the style of shooter not
large numbers of people low health plus
controller bread we're taking that out
of the equation because this does have a
PC version
yeah I'm not reviewing this so I don't
care so that you know this is just you
know kill everybody but it's a smaller
number of people
which I think makes a big difference in
a game like this
and you get the fighter on the
Millennium Falcon
Christopher gotcha
so you see on your map the red yeah
oh it's just you got shot once and it
looked like you did a little flipping
like no take this look great
well
on top of a falcon he's on top of the
tackle
it's a pretty good game you just have to
get used to it don't call it trash cuz
you suck what the fuck that's what
they're saying you know I think there
are some gameplay elements that make it
that take some of your control on it is
that guys still up there how do you get
up here question you might have a
jetpack
or there might be a level
we reached a new rank oh that's good
so thanks thank you
hey you could say congratulations
yeah yeah courage
thermal imploder is big grenade it
explodes a lot and implants whoa oh and
if you press down on the right stick
it's a it's a melee yeah
is used to denote sarcasm integers
that's true Kappa Kappa is sarcasm
apparently or feel free to use tim-tim
face
I hate donuts i I mean I think that's
part of it is people don't like to hear
negative stuff about things they spent
money on but I also think that there is
when you do like something there there's
a bit of a cultish nature to that where
it's like you you get it and maybe other
people just don't understand what makes
it so good you know no of course this
game is good you just don't get it there
that's that's part of like I think
there's an egotism egotism to that
obviously you just don't understand what
makes it so good let me explain it to
you
and I think a lot of that pushback comes
from the fact that you know rich and I
do talk about our opinions of games and
I think people assume that you know
I think people assume that like work
correct you know and there's no correct
there's just a pity there's just
opinions and rich and I are stating our
opinions and trying to elaborate on you
know why we feel about some you know
certain ways about certain things but
there's no correct and how you feel
about a game so yeah settle down I guess
that's what I'm saying mostly or don't I
don't care you do you do you man a girl
a guy there's something in between dog
can't write bad snippet snake
Jake rake whoopee
Dondon Sarlacc
what was the thing what was the thing in
Jabba's pit was that monster called the
rancor Branko rancor I was thinking for
a while but that thing is gone I
couldn't quite get the name Sarlacc bran
cool compound you thought they smelled
bad on the outside
good glad glad go gang you gotta go go
go go go
Winkle okay good I wish I was those Star
Wars fans who are in denial at this game
is shallow and you know like we like we
discussed earlier with light and with
rocket League you know the the
shallowness is in the gameplay it's just
so repetitive and so light and so it's
just not there and I'm very sorry if me
saying that hurts your feelings but I do
hope that you know if you if you enjoy
this game you know I'm happy I'm happy
that you find something you enjoy
that's all we're that's all any of us
are doing right we're just we're just in
this world looking just looking for
something to make us happy this game
makes you happy I think it's great just
be happy be a happy person I'm a happy
person most of the time yeah be happy
guy so what'd you think of that had it
had done I think that felt a lot better
slightly right I knew this kind of game
is just not my bag oh right I know but
I'm just you know I I wanted to make
sure you got a little bit of this too
because I thought that there's a
definite this is I remember liking the
heroes battle but there was something
like six versus six I was even well
exactly that was even less people
I think the game is actually too deep
for you to enjoy casually this game get
out of here don't get out yeah yeah get
right outta
I do think I think there's a lot of dumb
fun in this game there's it's
pewpewpewpewpew it's laser badass and
that's great I was just richest mistake
he say he saw those people
I tried shooting at them is that what
you're supposed to do yeah but you like
looked away first and look back that was
your thing anyway there's a lot of dumb
funds in this game bearish that's the
old bearish
you did I get one with a grenade
Jack you fucks don't even have a jetpack
we don't have a jetpack we haven't
unlocked the jetpack yet we have not
played enough to unlock a jetpack yet
because you can't have a jetpack then
until you play oh sorry we don't got no
jetpack I think you I think you killed
that guy yeah nothing feels better than
dying every 4 seconds Jack it's it's
very demoralizing whoa all right fucking
running away that doesn't seem to be the
best option rich just just sometimes you
need a tactical retreat you know
you did not kill that guy but I think
you've got a critical assist whatever
that means the critical assist yeah
great great join us off and play super
Star Wars or Rogue Squadron we could
super Star Wars has been re-released for
ps4 and Vita and possibly other things
but we're not gonna we're gonna play it
we're literally rich is gonna get done
with this game and then we're gonna
leave all right I want to play the
fucking heroes mode this this can bite
my ass which is gonna rage quit and play
heroes mode you rage quit quitting on my
account they're gonna think that's me
stop being a bitch recharge them and
then I die or I stay back and then I die
how about I not play the game yeah
gobbledygook I have explored the
loadouts I did not see a jetpack I it
might be available I didn't see one but
you know fuck it man I don't know
no this is probably the last match for
the night probably
Oscar says I've tried a call of duty on
free weekend I was playing with for
hours and when at last it was me who
decided a match I decided a match by not
dying and getting the last kill everyone
was shouting cheater right there's got
to be some strategy to this there's got
to be a get good element but I don't
care no big fun ever I hate every game
nothing's fun ever and I hate every game
I hit every game for the entertainment
strangers on the internet no night I had
my super long stream on Thanksgiving
honestly I wasn't enough he just did
that for you for all of it yes she just
did it what I got out of that was I was
on camera all day yeah and I'm not an
especially vain person so okay Neil's
not as rebel soldier dad go
whoa Wow
I can do by a Skywalker jump I can walk
like in the air oh shit fuck was that oh
you're in bad guy city rich they're all
the fuck over our heads or something
maybe
with that mad ketchup strap whoa what I
didn't see anybody fucking I'm running
like it yep
you defeated Boba Fett I did yeah well
you got the light doesn't happen
apparently you might have also killed
Han Solo but that's fine Oh what the
grade I don't think you hit him once
that was the controller that's what that
was yeah yeah that's funny but hey I
killed Boba Fett or killed Boba Fett you
did that that was me that's right rich
did a 14 hour stream of thumb on
Thanksgiving Day but I'm I'm bad at
games that I hate video games so that
couldn't possibly be right rich I know
you hate video games han Solo whoa what
was that
that was Han Solo's mega brother oh oh
there you go I think that might be like
a shoulder I think you like having you
tackle people when I got spread shot and
aim assists shit I don't know what this
one does but I haven't run away han Solo
you coward what the fuck is the 19
Imperials Jack do you want me to do what
do you think is so fucking funny because
that's so hot so uh I'm gonna shoot it
was so Han Solo that's exactly what he
would do
what run away run away like I know
shit's too tough
over here I'm leaving peace out bitches
it was one against six
what other strategy do you think is
viable
listen I'm not saying there was a better
strategy it was just humorous it was
just a rather fun black
he's fucking Darth Vader
what huh Leia's right work as a team
nice
Malby I was just gonna work so you want
to hold on someone long enough and it'll
like blue wasn't doing anything you
weren't on a guy you were not on a guy
button do you wanna hold on long enough
for blue PD bloop and then it's a homing
missile and you need to lock on yes by
the way it's very weird that pal pees
just like in the snow that is very very
scary it's very weird to see him walking
around in the foot battles they couldn't
find another person
Oh boba fett you sneaky fuck like no uh
no Greedo camping Guido
nice nice you did him you got what you
did him you kept it oh yeah that guy -
now you're in a murder spree you just
got a murder puppy and you're good to go
once again for on one eye it's just
great how dare you criticize me for
doing the smart thing I do not criticize
I just think it's funny I just think
it's great
no you're you actually oh you've got to
keep running though you got to keep
running it's actually the really smart
thing because you were the last hero
left and so like the longer you stay
alive the longer your teammate is to
have a chance to kill pallfy it would
like it's just it's humorous I can't
help it that Han Solo running away is
funny rich is doing smart listen I'm
just thinking like Palpatine where was
the rest of my team jack that's right
where did they go I don't know what
happened to them
I we're on to different things now I
kill Boba Fett I did my job
yep Palpatine being in the ground
battles is done okay
what Joe what so the question is who is
more suited who's that who's a better
villain in Star Wars original trilogy
canon to be to be a playable character
who we got go so Greedo is you know
that's why I'm throwing up grand moff
tarkin sure sure
I like Jeff Jabba the Hutt's that would
be great that would actually be great
okay now rich you know the mad Luke
strategy runner-up and whale on people
the mouth of the Sarlacc
nope
yeah you got to get them in close
quarters so you can't use this ranged
attacks you can find lay it all last it
it'd be great
it'd be great if Jabba was a playable
character climbing around all right you
just punched people you have like
infinity oh so well the chant putting in
that spot open then Palpatine
they got known I think I know one yeah I
mean I'm sure they have someone I just
haven't been who's Admiral Piett Darth
Vader six second in command and the
super service room okay I could you know
what I could just see like a general a
random general a general general
about what about slowly moving walls you
could play as slowly moving walls no
that does not work on them it just takes
it takes a while that's it that's more
like a distance thing it's great it's
just what I got last time
all right
nice killed somebody you know if you're
gonna die to Darth Vader that's the way
to do it you want to die to 1/4 joke
absolutely did some damage I think
that's good
Oh what Tuscan Raider that would
actually be cool to play as a Tuscan
right here yeah I'm gonna get you
all right well then yeah I'm all done
great hey that's great I like it when
we're all done more floor
mundo was taken would like to know is if
the top screen prompts of defeat all the
enemy fighters is indicative of how dumb
the game is I certainly I think it is
but that's just my opinion and that's
okay we're not caught up I was reading
them as they came for a while I'd missed
some I think we missed like the front
ones though well L argentino the real
