perfect it's hidden from the world how
you doing jack oh great
I was watching some coverage rich of CES
the Consumer Electronic Show case mm-hm
I don't know if you ever watch Linus
tech tips no I've never heard of Linus
tech tips like a computer guy you review
stuff and he's these funny in general
and he was reviewing a new computer case
and computer component system
specifically meant for living room okay
you know the slimmer case design meant
to blend down and along with that he was
designing it and had a special name but
it was essentially a board it was a
fancy board that you wear on your lap
that house is you're a mouse and a
keyboard at all I mean I hit all the
wires but all it was was this fancy
board it was great board I fell out of a
dump job mister board I found at the
dump that's all you need that was my
thing well you need I've already got a
living room desktop yeah I basically my
living room the desk is right next to
the TV a kind like an l-shaped desk TV
Stan and the computers just plugged into
the both the TV and my computer monitor
yeah I can I can I can use the teeth of
the computer from both the desk and the
couch super fancy that's very fancy hi
everybody
why was rich at the dump well to look
for a board of course of course and so
what does this get this game called Pony
Island I know very little about this
game I just know this is the the popular
indie game at the moment and it's not
about ponies okay even though it's
called Pony on so we're gonna click the
left mouse button we're gonna we're
gonna see with pony and all about
I mean I kind of love it already
one of the options this game is the new
hotness that is this is all fine kicking
up the high gear oh my god high gear
baby
maybe how's the audio volume because
there's an audio you know I'm sure it's
fine
yeah I'm sure sure it's fine this time
loop it says I just started watching
Supergirl can you express your level of
disappointment in this show no no real
disappointment because I wasn't
expecting it to be great I want a good
Supergirl show because I like Supergirl
but it's you know it's also by CBS and
so I had very low expectations but I I
made it to three episodes in and I
stopped watching it because I thought it
was kind of bullshit and so audio is
fine great audio works great I'm great
so this is now the game within the game
yeah
error
cheerful facade you know that needs to
be clean
advanced RNG free ticket Pony physics
fixed start menu oh well yeah yeah it's
definitely fixed or is this just just
curious okay
oh I see that do you see it do you see
that the game froze for everyone else um

sorry good for everybody
we need to apparently go back back like
try unclicking the game and what the
fuck indeed no yeah refresh it how that

no oh wait look can you move the back
button ah there you go
that's calmer nice Colin can we get out

close this just close the whole game we
probably need to do something on the
Start menu sorry everybody we're gonna
yeah I see that I see that you're on the
audio menu we are on it everybody very
sorry there's just too many graphics you
set the graphics setting way to an
average okay great we're on it

trackpad rich has a board on his lap so
yes yes oops

alright so get back to the game
nope they're okay
nope it's low it's black again now but
wait are they seeing your mouse yeah
that that's weird right yeah that's way
that's not right now
I go to options and go back to normal
graphics come back to I don't know full
screen is fine but go to graphics
quality don't think full screen is fine
well it was on full screen before and
they saw it but it only messed up when
you change the graphics quality too high
oh wait now they can see it no okay

okay
okay
nice nice nice rich riches got disc
we're getting out of pokey pokey Pony
Jack can't stop watching this madness I
can it's it's amazing oh that is right
just figured it out already
this is fun it's a fun little thing it's
what do we want here oh by the way quick
cuz I know we talked about this one
Karen was here about uh this is gonna be
a little Star Wars talk and I think now
that it's been out what a few weeks now
yeah so you know mild spoilers I'm not
gonna talk like super spoilers but I did
want to clear up one thing we were
talking about with Star Wars The Force
awakens was whether or not
Rey saw someone used the Jedi mind trick
and I just rewatched it today I went
this morning and we watched it because I
really liked the movie and no she does
not
see anyone use the Jedi mind trick I
think there are some logical
explanations as to how she was able to
use it but to clear that up ray did not
see anyone use the Jedi mind trick she
could have learned about it when she
probed kylo Ren's mind or it could just
be something she had heard about in the
past cuz Jedi's are kind of famous
poni lasers oh oh oh my god oh look at
that nice now go back and turn that off
exactly Tiberius Kirk like kylo Ren is
using a quasi Jedi mind trick and so
it's she can figure it out you can you
can figure out how she can figure it out
but no there's no specific usage of the
Jedi mind trick but
yep yep do it rich oh I love that pony
laser laughs nice
nicely done laughs oh god get him nice
you got this Oh
look this one prism guys
now that rich you nailed it nailed it
but
so no case that was all that was all
know what like we've talked about Star
Wars enough where I don't think we need
to talk about Star Wars anymore but I
know that was whatever you know if it
comes up but that was one specific thing
that I know we were talking about and
and I didn't have the answer for it so I
when I was rewatching it today I was
specifically looking for for that well
what about ash vs. Evil Dead oh I did
watch all of ash versus the evil dead
and I'm prepared to talk about ash
versus the able to help you she did hey
now hey now Satan that ain't nice
Oh
this is it the what
it's a kind of defense that he set up
its a guard the file shouldn't be a
problem since it's locked up
Oh Oh what
as a Zelo
this is not gonna be good
do you believe this would be easy yes
kind of did oh oh oh
that did something okay so uh ash versus
the evil that yeah what what what Oh
my stream tip isn't working right now
hold on I'm about to talk about ash
versus evil bed and then someone gave us
a tip open it up again
not try a Lord Belmont says not trying
to tell you what to do but people are
excited to see Jack rich and J play the
seventh guests will that happen anytime
soon plus J would like until dawn we
don't know what we're usually figure out
what we're playing right before we play
them J hasn't been available to stream
because you know busy with editing other
things but yes we will play the 7th
guest I cannot tell you how long we'll
play it but we will play it one of these
days
ash vs. Evil Dead there was a lot of
things I liked about it and I've really
hated the ending I really left a really
bad thing yes yes let's print on what
you want out of the show right right
oh is he he's playing against you yep
it's funny what you wanted yeah like
like I kind of wanted I understand why
they did what they did yeah if it if you
just wanted like an evil dead mini
series with a conclusion it's bad but
they need to keep it open for future
seasons is the problem no they couldn't
they couldn't resolve it they absolutely
could have resolved it oh you know what
not even resolved it you know what would
have been nice her some sort of
character growth some sort of lesson
learned some sort of change of something
you know
nice nicely done you have a locker you
know you know there was character growth
just not why did he not just you know
why did he do what he did exactly to
save his friend yes the same service but
it was still the easy way out which is
the Asch way which I get by the way it's
very it's very ash how how it ended
it was unsatisfying how it ended
you know there always could have been
more evil you know just because you get
the book just because he stopped the
lady doesn't mean that her demon
children won't do something later I
thought those were pretty cool there was
there was so much potential and as over
so overall it just left a really bad
taste in my mouth it's the real thing
oh no I never write like ash is not
about character growth but like none of
the other characters did anything either
did anything either you know
Oh
fucker fucker fucker you know no one no
one everyone was in the same position at
the end of the season that they were in
at the start of the season uh-huh and I
don't like shows that do that in general
I do I like a little something to happen
I liked it still there was a lot of fun
in there and it was definitely better it
was definitely better binge watching it
yes then then waiting and watching one
thing at a time
oh you got this rich you got this I'm
not so sure about that
but there were and especially at the end
there I want to say like the second to
last episode there was some like really
fantastic stuff you know there was some
really good SLOC and gore but overall I
did like especially at that ending it's
just like so that's all I have to say
about some good some bad like I'm trying
to be in the mindset of someone who
wasn't a huge fan of the series and I
don't know how they would feel about it
but again the show is not really made
for that kind of people so it doesn't oh
did you do it I think so nice watch are
you doing
I will not fail my what's the chat
saying about ash versus evil that no do
to wanna why was Xena even remotely
worried about Ash's life about his life
what sense do you made I don't think she
was ever worried about ash his life I
think
Xena knew that Ash had the power to
defeat her and so that's why she made
the deal she made
oh nothing he makes can be right is that
what that I think
yeah I don't know rich Wow we're fucked
already reg red oak ultima says I have
no nostalgia for Evil Dead whatsoever
the series was okay not great but okay
and I agree has the show proven its
reason to exist ask smokey 885 that's
the important question sure yeah I was
into it was entertaining enough it was
entertaining enough for me
nice you did it it was entertaining
enough for me and I mean I love Bruce
Campbell so much and there was there's
some really fun action and gore and
schlock your profit is false rich do it
delete core file oh yeah
double click and then go up to yes no
double click on delete foreigner oh nice
Oh nope nope missed oh yeah I don't get
why more people aren't talking about
Fargo and how great season 2 was I did
not like season 2 a Fargo have you seen
any Fargo No season 1 is a goddamn
masterpiece yeah since who's alright
Jeff we have been deceived why I don't
know that's what that's the evil thing
said oh no Satan tech Inc is on to us I
did not like season 2 of Fargo as much
as I liked season 1 and again I thought
it had a really crappy ending
one
Oh
maybe go to the messenger
nope try it
what's faster
I get it
another thing I have an ammo count so
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna spam
that's my tactic here will we be
attending be fest I will not be sounds
dreadful I've never gone what I went
once and I loved it it is intense though
because it is 24 straight hours of bad
movies and it's intense and some
sometimes it's horrible but like oh I
probably need to get a certain point
hopefully if I need to do this I mean
it's here we have to assume I thought it
was wonderful and horrible which kind of
made it more wonderful but I will not
just I just can't I can't take that much
time off amen
that's my real thing
can you hold space down oh I can't
you're totally right
nice job rich I improved efficiency you
have you have improved efficiency 1000%
and saved the audience from horrible
clacking noise I tried to stand still
and to shoot whatever comes towards me
yeah that kind of works I can only
assume I have to get to a certain point
I don't think I fucking know I don't
know I think I played pony galaxy's
before I thought you were pony galaxy's
expert I thought that's why we were
streaming this oh don't you want a
ticket Oh is he
let's see if we can get to a hundred
be fest is a really cool thing it's over
at Northwestern University for anyone
who doesn't know and it's it's 24 hours
of movies playing on a big screen bad
movies and it is it's straight like
there's no break there's no stop it's
just bad movies playing on a screen in a
theater full of people and people sleep
in the movie theater people let's find a
place to sleep it on campus well we got
a ticket so that's yeah and it's it's
horrible and wonderful and these is fine
when you find this message hey girl
yeah girl good it's good to see you that
Oz Iselle
guy was mad oh you still there yeppers
did well with that first however we
still have to deal with the other two
right despite the amount of data that
was corrupted security will be increased
it won't be easy for me to open the
other portal other portal I leave and I
have an idea
log on to my user profile the password
is two seven three four two seven three
four okay meet me over there
okay all right get out of here
is there live commentary oh yeah I know
people yell stuff at the screen at B
fest probably log out
you made it over yep
he's never guessed my password thus far
open the search Prague's tool
yes that's not great we need to find a
program with the worst possible security
something less than 5% could allow me to
open another portal to the correct
second core file ok need to be
incredibly poorly programmed ok it's
incredible
oh here we go
never at least to greatest yeah
Oh
Oni Island Exe can you get there oh wait
if you want to be free this machine you
must delve into pol the island once more
I don't hear but it must be tough fine
Pony Island and play it as soon as I am
able to portal the corrupted file okay
great the corrupted profile next to mine
may be worth investigating it says our
friend next to his yeah right if you log
out again there's like a corrupted
profile yeah if people you're wondering
if people talk too much over at B fest
over the movie and that makes it
unenjoyable no no it's fine
the corrupted one but
to say password see if you can just get
in with my password
what was his password again - 7 3 9 2 3
7 9 10 3 7 though
one here try again there oh wait no no
go back in what two three seven nine two
seven they're good
seven Oh was a Niner five

hype trainer even 4x come to O be hyper
when it comes out and if I have in my
hands I'll love all of the stuff yeah
that's true you did it I got things to
do oh my god this is new there is a huge
amount of corrupted data north of you
our best chance at opening another
portal lies there play along and
is that nothing what is it
I like your Satan nor it's can we go
yeah
I can't move at all I think you just
have to go okay
we're just playing along here don't
forget about your laser
Laser power over zero what
Oh
if laser power over zero
I'm not sure what it wants just get that
you need to loop it somehow right now
laser power equals zero now it equals
negative one right now laser power
equals one not laser power equals zero
yeah
we need to skip this somehow Oh or we
need to double up on that I don't know I
don't know I get it now when his face
cop out tomorrow you'll know about it
tomorrow all the space cops in is it'll
be available tomorrow with the next
blinky review the next prereq is also
out tomorrow there's a new half in the
bag tomorrow and a new best of the worst
tomorrow it's all happening Oh laser
powers five and now it's six that's
seven you have you've looped it how high
can you go
well bum bum let's get to 20 okay I
don't care that we are from Milwaukee
why aren't we watching the football game
is because fuck the Packers
I hope they die rich is original I know
there's a there's a plane crash the
whole team fucking dies on the way to
the next game
rich is illiterate is originally from
the Chicagoland area and I don't much
care about sports so we don't care about
stuff we don't care about the Packers in
general
this is like a little dubstep ebook II

this basically asking about Space Camp I
presume yeah yeah all tomorrow at this
point they might actually believe it
though great
tomorrow will be a blinker review for
each Star Wars movie show book ever man
that's true that was no ground
I see two other you need your wing yeah
I need the pony we need to figure out
how to get you a pony wing
who's responsible for this game someone
that level is a little tricky try
levelling up you can cry
experience over here it's away from
where we need to go I don't trust that
right nowhere to go over there there's
no cracker man five to six just once
wants to know whether or not space cop
is going to take 12 years to make so
everyone will know in advance whether or
not it is the greatest movie ever made
oh wait then you already do this
or is this you grinding it is apparently
the grinding OOP
this is the grinding up
you
oh honey look you sound like Palpatine
sometimes sometimes I do a little puppy
no no no space kappahd I don't know like
um because when did you start production
on the original space guy it doesn't
count it's an entirely different thing
I'm just saying could we could we count
it in the 12 years if we were making a
joke
no buts I mean some of the some jokes
need to die some jokes some jokes have
outlived their usefulness the 12 years
to make joke is done it's fine right
that's fine right
I like that fuck you it's space come
experience gained o1o we get pony wings
next level 99 our experiences to go
shouldn't take you too long oh that's
really funny oh nice
nice
it'll take 12 years for that joke to end
you know I like them I like that uh you
know I'm okay I'm okay with any sort of
a joke I enjoy those kinds of things
oh yes so now you need to bypass yeah
easy why can't you play my game the way
I intended
enjoy the wings nice
whose idea was it for the force awakens
half the bag which potentially could
have been the highest viewed half in the
bag EPS whatever
whose idea was it to have it end with
rich saying the c-word fifteen times in
20 seconds mine there was believed in
red that was completely improved
completely I did like that good and you
guys really did film that after seeing
like a midnight viewing for him yeah
that was that was an act oh I didn't
float jump again okay and then can you
just keep hitting jump to fly over at
all you glide to kind of you can't flap
if you hit jump again no okay
rich is a legend yep that cunt is a
spectacular swear word because it's it's
one of the few swear words I think that
still holds some weight yeah you know
like really apparently not over the
cross upon I've heard it doesn't oh yeah
yeah oh they they they use content like
we use fuck uh yeah that's not heard
I still love it I know that that word
really has some weight for me it means
something to me I'm usually pretty upset
with someone if I called him a cunt
which leads to endless accusations that
the reasons Mike enjoyed the film was
because he was tired and doing carry
something
oh no yeah I think Michael genuinely
enjoyed him you know why it's a fun
fantasy movie with action Mike digs that
kind of stuff
cunt is the only word that still makes
girls mad yes that is very true nope
nope I like bint never heard of it I've
never heard of it in Australia cunt is
more like jerk nice
mr. idiot man we've talked about this
whether or not ray is a Mary Sue it
doesn't matter the Star Wars is a
fantasy movie in which space Wizards can
read minds we talked about it
extensively last stream and I just don't
give enough of a shit about Star Wars to
talk about it more we're done it it
doesn't matter if she is the best at
everything ever it's a movie that has
space wizards in it the kind of the
rules logic why you're looking for logic
in a movie that featured space wizards
and mind-reading because you know what
my problem is with the movie was face
Wizards it's not realistic enough is
this britches concentrating he can't be
with me on the jokes here but nicely
done rich
bitch plus cunt equals bint our nice
doo-doo-doo-doo space with space wizards
sorry you're right now a new master
their space Wizards logic is okay in
some movies but you know oh well that
was interesting
how did you get over there interesting
consistency is greater than logic and
fantasy right and I think everything is
consistent in those movies if Ray were
male and had all the same traits and did
all the same things do you think anyone
would care be asserting the same
criticism yes because people really like
to criticize things also I think that
people associate the ability to nitpick
something with that thing being
inherently bad you know and so they like
to look at the force awakens and there
are little maybe it's maybe some logic
flaws maybe little things that don't
make a lot of sense and they say well
because I have the ability to nitpick
this it is a bad thing that's not always
true wait what oh nothing killed me it's
just
you're doing it you're doing it oh my
god
rich you are a pony island oh you jack
jinx oh I'm sorry jack excuse
