oh fuck
no idea what to do
the trick is to constantly sled talk and
RAM yourself into every attack but know
that helpful that's helpful
a tubful jack
it's tough
I mean obviously it's tough but the real
tough part is you know the
the tactic for all of the minor enemies
don't you know the tactic for all the
minor enemies is different than the boss
tactic yes specifically this one and and
the fishface lady you know well they're
special they're split their specials so
of course the taxes could be different
but they're so this one is so different
where it's like how could how could we
have been prepared for it
you know the question is did we miss
something that would keep us from
getting the spare him ending I don't
know did we do something that would keep
us from getting the spare him and do we
have to you know one of things do we
have to kill him do we miss something to
spare him did we not do a thing did we
not do a thing okay they say we're good
as far as not missing things okay
he's killed you three times already not
seven
kind of have something to do with this
fighting
sans told us we've been a good boy
okay yeah we so we haven't killed anyone
yep gotta have something to do with this
fighting so maybe we just have to get
his level down far enough you know
and then we can talk to him
knowing that rich and Jack might beat a
score and then go home to eat cheese and
eggs fills me with determination that
says Red Dog gautama red d'Agoult Red
Dog Ultimo Jack is playing right now
beef in it
be fair
have Jack equipped the dagger before the
next friend I think I already equipped
that knife we just found we have the toy
dagger
that's in the inventory we found another
one that I equipped right in the room
but I wonder if we're supposed to have
the toy dagger equipped that's what they
know I don't think so I'm not sure I
don't know anything
saying we have the better dagger
equipped yeah my only thought is if we
get his help down too far enough will
trigger something
oh fuck you I moved
get killed enough times and he'll get
bored I'm sure that's not warned dagger
not toy we have the warn dagger equipped
yes we have the warn dagger
come on Jack you can do it you can do it
stick and jab stick and jab I'll fuck
you I moved you gotta help see the toy
knife is in our inventory
look
I wonder half fuck if these if these
it's the up
alright alright alright
so the plan of attack
week is there a way we can get health
items I mean yeah if we go all the way
back five more months there's get more
money
we have to go farm do you know what we
have to do you don't entirely know about
sorry all I really got from that was
fighting it seems to be the only path to
go and my my thought is if we can get
him to low enough health maybe we can
get him talking again you know that's a
soon yeah cuz we just need more talking
from him I'm not looking at the chat not
looking at the chat chat
before time same dance
way too long my knees
all right I fucked this attempt up I'm
going to die really good yeah those are
funny you just have to kind of go down
until you find that opening and let the
opening up you rich okay that's fine no
wait listen you're getting your you're
getting your mojo backwards you're just
getting that mojo probably it probably
shouldn't take it with you this year you
were getting the mojo did you want it
back you seem to be having the Mojo and
you're right we were that we were doing
silly we were mojo swapping the mojo
swapping over mr. mojo swapping mr. mojo
risin mr. mojo mr. mojo risin no no no
doors mr. mojo risin mojo risin get your
motor rock rising get your motor rising
oh he nods grievously after he's killed
me five times five
they'll never get the Timmy Armour they
won't even go get some food we're broke
we're fucking broke
oh wow mustache the player says how does
it feel to get butt-fucked by a guy
named a scorer but fuck it it'll be the
guy he's probably not gonna be gentle
about it easy either
you know it's not his you know the guy
who's not gonna wreck your anus a firm
cushy
did today go to college no Timmy did not
go to college no we did not have enough
money to send me to college
if you go to Timmy village you can sell
items for more than they cost to buy
right I remember someone saying
something about that is like that's
saying like a long process longer and
more tedious than fighting the firm or
dying over and over again
temmie village is over 30 minutes of
grinding I don't great it's way better
to just fight the farm okay
forget the healing items you guys are
good enough to beat this since veggie 64
was obviously a new viewer
these ones stupid plane falling the
hardest time with those
you should check and see if you have
healing items in your box just checks a
box a box through your phone that sounds
like a good idea that is a good idea how
you talking now that's useful
information right now jack is playing I
switched it back to Jack after one try
because Jack was in the he was in the
zone and I wasn't a better mojo I was
rusty yeah so I'm gonna better mood you
check your box check your box what we're
gonna do now we're gonna go diddle up
box for a little bit see if there's any
goodies in there no I'm Sam open the box
what's in the bag
it seems that you guys are not enjoying
playing and you have Stockholm Syndrome
with this game oh no I there's large
parts that I enjoy about this game this
boss battle in particular like I enjoy
the cleverness of this game yes overall
lots of very clever things I enjoy this
game of fun characters there are moments
like this when I'm sure you have to do a
very specific thing and it feels
contradictory to what the rest of the
game has taught us that I'm sure is very
clever oh wait but it doesn't feel
natural you know an ice cream
put away that weight alone I'm gonna you
don't need the fucking tapir anymore oh
that's a good idea I want to see what
the snowman screen does yeah oh nice
please take this to the ends of the
earth that's where we don't eat snowman
piece not the snowman piece snowman
piece no wait they're saying no eat
don't eat don't dairy the snowman piece
I guess that counts is killing something
oh oh Jesus did you eat it
no I didn't come
a la some people saying it doesn't
matter if you do the vast majority or
like and large-cap saying don't eat the
snow man I'm not gonna there's no Matt
be okay okay it doesn't count as killing
killing something and we have nothing in
the bench to be fucked well we got the
nice cream so we got one more how fine
well you just bring the snow man maybe
we're in an emergency I don't know
everyone people are telling us no the
snow man gives you a piece of him to
take to the end it's sad to eat it is it
just because it's sad or will it hurt us
in our pacifism run it's just an easter
egg if you bring it to the end
so I guess something happens I'm still
have it
it's sentimental garbage snow is
delicious it doesn't hurt you it's just
sad
you hate that one hate that one rich
this one I'm not too fond of
talk to him three times it makes things
so much easier it lowers his defense
when you talk about that's right I
forgot about that
let's take bets on how long it takes to
defeat this boss 20 minutes 40 minutes
question mark sir longer than that there
is the 100 hole in the trash yes but a
second by as much as another hamburger
well how much money was it in the trash
under just honoured you sure was just
honored
hey I was just honored
I think I have no yeah 100
the food in the alley shop for sheep
that's right there's that alley shop
100 gold can buy for cinnamon bunnies
and Snowden Energy will buy you junk
food in the shop in the creepy alleyway
like a current gold situation is we only
had like fifty nine gold we could go
back to that 100 G that Jack like
refused because I'm a nice guy to take
that money that somebody threw in the
garbage because they didn't want it
anymore
the the bicycles somebody's mention
because you can use them twice now so
saying you're out doing that bad
nope
there was that was the lowest I got him
down health-wise how far down wasn't
less than happening who I'm gonna guess
it's gonna need to be like 10% other
things yeah yeah yeah
stay determined
let's give their money huh it's good
that money let's get that money and go
to that outlet
oh yeah you're right no you're right all
right all right everyone ten you could
win easily what more food they have
confidence in you
you know I feel pretty good I'm almost
the last time you stood up Jack it's oh
it's been way too long I just
straightened out my legs a little bit
ago and my knees are killing me
yeah so you go you quick do this I'm
gonna stand up thank you no problem
you'll be fine you'll be fine
now you're gonna remember what a trash
can was because while you're gone I'm
totally gonna steal money from that
trash can
all right where was it where was it jack
where was the trash thing blow here
which was which way right hold this up
monsters right right Oh much better you
know just we've been sitting for like
three hours and so we have to beat this
fucking game
oh we're beating oh yeah there guys so
go right right you tell me right
again up again
really no really there there is an
energy drink in in the kitchen right now
and I'm not gonna have it because then I
just won't get to sleep tonight it's way
too late for that but I was thinking
about it I was thinking about when we
started this room but I have had plenty
of coffee today whole idea of coffee
that's a regular diet koban one there's
no there's no good the damages Lobby is
down here right yeah have any fun good
things 17 oh that's perfect that's
better than what we had no we're done no
are you sure you sure I'm filled up
enough oh but you know what you could do
what sells something that's useless no
no we don't have anything that's all I
got for the other thing there's a save
station up there put some stuff in a box
oh no but I guess it'll matter as long
as you say yeah okay great
oh wait wait I'll pay the house Angie if
you get medicine to autograph my but
that might have been possible maybe okay
find our way back now okay what are they
saying what's going on what's the jam
they're saying I'm guessing it's over
after a score anyway yeah
ezmo I dare you to stop playing right
now I never continue oh my god wait when
that would that be terrible we would be
terrible gamers if we just like yep
alright no more we're not gonna show you
how it ends
many people think we are terrible gamers
I mean you know ya know why don't we
live up to our reputation I mean why
change no why change now
alright we're terrible gamers it's fine
see you later everyone this one I get it
okay okay here we go are you doing this
oh my goodness let me give one shot okay
she's gonna get one chat now don't save
you because there's another save above I
mean you can't save you yeah yeah it
seemed very redundant like very
redundant saves oh boy why are those
there in case you died oh my god there's
another one here too yeah that's that's
the final oh my god okay here we go here
we go you got this rich what let's get

waitwait but any one more fight we have
more healing items
I'll books and watch what I was moving
them steadily moving I know same thing
as having a baby daughter
ah wait Oh notice how it is I remember
the day after my son died
the entire underground was devoid of
hope the future and once again been
taken from us by humans in a fit of
anger and declared war
I said I would destroy any human that
came here I would use their souls to
become godlike and for yes from this
terrible prison
and I would destroy humanity
and that monsters ruled the surface in
peace
the people's hopes are turned
my wife however became disgusted she
left this place never to be seen again
truthfully I do not want power
I do not want to hurt anyone I just
wanted everyone to have hope but
I cannot take this any longer I just
want to see pirate life
I just wanted my iron
this wall has gone on long enough I have
the power we are having a fucking moment

the souls of the innocent children okay
okay everyone your
I just can't understand oh we ran away
Oh what you went through the door okay
now it's an upper tail hey Toby Fox
that's a nice game and you too Tammy
Qiang timid I'm a Qiang and all of you
too and as well as you and did it all
and you as well
and either you to thank you for this
nice game nother game one of the same is
there more ma they're saying ma let's
see we got hey is anyone there
Wow
I'll just leave a message sure
oh it's been a while the Queen returned
and is now ruling over the underground
she's in state at a new policy kill all
of these youth and shoulder all of the
humans who fall here will be treated not
as enemies but as friendless it's
probably for the best anyway the human
souls the King gathered seem to have
disappeared
apparently you murdered their souls it's
very depressing nobody here likes to
think about it
the king was gonna put them in like in a
nice bedroom yeah they were gonna get
free meals but no the souls are dead
things are looking grim for our freedom
the moon's trying her best not to let us
give up hope so hey how are you doing if
we're not giving up down here don't give
up
wherever you are okay who knows how long
it will take but we will get out of here
sans who are you talking to nobody
Wang Wang a nobody can I talk to that
poo here
knock yourself out second I recognize
this noble human I'm doing fine
well besides one thing the Queen
disbanded the Royal Guard since we don't
have to fight human no more oh I have no
idea what to do with my life but that's
okay because I'm still working hard even
if it's all nothing at all so don't feel
like papyrus is heart who then is what
is the good dinosaur names got bad she's
lost a job then she lost her mouse you
said Bauer taken care of her she lives
on our couch now over a sleepover
there's no escape from the play oh we
gave her a job to Saints hi there the
illegal hot dog stand illegal hot dog
stand she she hates working the hell
bullshit make some food hot ow
oh yeah she's still buy new for the
disappearance of a skull she stalks me a
lot she has a ludicrous plan to cross
the barrier and beat you up who believe
to be honest neither guess impossible
but I want to believe it's not cuz I
want to go with her
then I'd get to see you again hate it
even if I'd have to fight you
you know well pinky fix cross
you are the undertale all-star Jack all
right be my vocal cards why did you get
don't you realize it'd be nice just
makes a good hard look at yourself
you made all these great friends but now
you probably never see him again
not to mention how much they've been set
back by you hurts if you had just gone
through without caring about it you
wouldn't have to feel bad now so I don't
still end up like this what is life
really that unfair yeah yeah it is maybe
just a punk-ass bitch
what if I told you I knew some way to
get a better day you have to know you
safer where in the meantime why don't
you go see you dad it seems like he
could have been better friend who knows
maybe she's got the king do y'all happen
me see you soon
all right what's the plan for that Wow
what do you mean those Hey apparently
there's more we can do I know I know I
know
no no we are not are we done done I'm
done done like with this game in general
streaming or do you think we'll do that
last bit what's looking to leave its
