Part three.
Now this is where it gets complex my lovelies. So I think this is what happened, I’m not sure, but Palpatine wanted to create a crisis on Naboo so that the naïve young Queen would propose a vote of “No Confidence” for Chancellor Valorum. This would lead to Palpatine getting elected in his place right? Like, I mean that’s the plot?... I think?
So how does killing the Jedi or creating a communications blackout on the planet even get word back to the senate that there is a CRISIS? At the end of the movie, Amidalan goes back to the planet to solve the problem herself, cuz the Senate wanted to send an independent team to investigate whether or not the invasion was real.
(Chancellor Valorum) “Will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?”
I guess the testimony of two Jedi Knights wasn’t good enough. Those were the guys that Valorum trusted enough to settle the whole dispute in the first place… That don’t make sense.
So anyways when, when the guys told Palpatine that, that Jedi’s were there he should’ve said this. “Tell the Jedi that there will be no negotiations. Tell them that you plan to invade the planet next, and then send them back to Coruscant to inform the Senate.”
Instead he tells them to do the exact opposite of what will help his plan. Like, he wanted her to sign the treaty right?
(Palpatine) “I want that treaty signed!”
He seemed really intent on having her sign the treaty to make the invasion legal. So what if she was like a total coward and then actually SIGNED the treaty? Like right away? Then the crisis would be over and there’d be no need for a vote of no confidence. See what I mean, this sounding like an 8 year old wrote it?
So anyways, it’s time to kill off the Jedi. Oh good… How do they go about it?
Well, they start pumping in an obvious deadly white gas into the room. This alerts them to danger. Well actually blowing up their ship does? I guess they should have pumped in the gas first, then after the Jedi’s were dead, THEN blow the ship up? Anyways, back to the gas.
Hey idiots! Have you ever heard of Carbon Monoxide? It’s odourless and colourless. Your wife won’t even know what hit her. Oh… I mean Jedi. Also, moments earlier, the Jedi willingly drink tea that was given to them WHILE they discussed how everything felt really fishy.
(Qui-Gon) “I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute.”
Hey, you guys got any rat poison lyin around? PUT IT IN THE TEA! PUT IT IN THE TEA! THEY’LL DRINK IT! PUT THE RAT POISON IN THE T-
So anyways, then the Dioxicin starts filling up the room and…
(Qui-Gon) "Dioxicin!"
Hey wait. How does Qui-Gon know what kind of gas it is BEFORE he smells it? Isn’t that like a contradiction? If you smell the deadly white gas, I guess it’s a little too late. Maybe he just got a little sniff of it.
Anyways, y’know this idea COULD work, because we see that the Jedi hold their breath. Which implies there’s some kind of danger of them running OUT of breath, right? Maybe they can hold their breath for like two hours cuz their Jedi’s? Well no that’s not true, cuz later in the film we see they need to use them breathing things underwater for that short swim to the Gunga sea world.
So anyways, it’s like the Jedi know that the droids are gonna open up the door in a very short time before they run out of breath, because they don’t immediately start trying to cut their way out. Which is what I’D be doing. I’d probably be screaming too, like a little girl. So what are they DOING in there?!
Then the dumbest line in the movie is said.
(Gunray) “They must be dead by now. Destroy what’s left of them.”
What does that mean?... Hey asshole!!! How ‘bout you leave the door closed for like 4 hours, and then if they try to cut through the door, start shooting them in the face. Then pump in more gas, and keep pumping it in.
Obviously you’ve never suffocated a hooker that was trying to escape from your crawl space before. I’d recommend spraying RAID in there. You need to go with the fast kill, low irritant kind. It’s in the blue bottle. It works the best. You’ll need about 6 cans though.
What was I talking about?.... Oh, right. So they open the doors anyways and they let the Jedi out, and attack them with completely useless robots. Just tell ‘em to leave and that you don’t wanna negotiate, and then when their ship flies out of your space dock, SHOOT IT WITH LASERS!
Also we need to consider the fact that killing two Jedi that were sent there as peaceful ambassadors would be a pretty heinous crime in the eyes of the Galactic Senate. An organization that runs everything, including space taxes. I mean you could just claim that they never got there.
(Nute Gunray) “I know nothing of any ambassadors.”
(Palpatine) “I have assurances ofrom the Chancellor. His ambassadors DID arrive.”
But now you’ve got the burned wreckage of their ship inside your horribly burned docking bay.
Number 4: Who’s Doing What? Where? Why?
Why are the Chaternarians taking orders from this mystery hologram again? What did he promise them that would be so worth risking their entire organization for?
The location of the fountain of youth? A planet made of gold? Corrective surgery for this woman’s face? How about a night in Megan’s Fox hole? Seriously, what was it? Oh we’re never told, are we?
Generally speaking it’s easy to get a handful of insane people to follow you on some kind of illegal or crazy scheme, but when you’re talking about a huge organization that’s run with military efficiency, then their probably gonna want something in return for the use of 30 of their ships and risking everything.
Darth Sidious can’t really promise them future political favours because it would give away who he is. When they get arrested at the end they could just say, “It was like a hologram in a cloak. He made us do it! In fact he looks like… Palpatine. And he sounds like him too! We got the recordings of the hologram, you wanna look at em?”
I find it hard to believe that these guys never started pointing fingers after they got caught.
Number 5: I can’t put enough quotation marks around the word “Story” so I won’t try
(Thing-in-the-Mouth-Face) “Sir! They’ve gone up the ventilation shaft!”
How do you know that? I said how do you KNOW that?! Answer me Thing-in-the-Mouth-Face!!! What is that anyways? What, did ya smoke too much? What’s wrong with your faaace?
Anyways, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, they end up in the hangar bay somehow where the droid armies are being staged for an invasion. Why don’t the Jedi’s just start fighting all of them? Then steal a ship and head back to Coruscant to tell the Galactic Senate what’s goin on? It’s not so crazy, because later in the film they attempt to run the blockade with ONE ship and they make it through. The fact that they even TRIED that makes this a possible option.
What is wrong with your faaace?!?! (Thing-in-the-Mouth-Face)
But instead Qui-Gon in all his wisdom thinks it’s a better idea to go down with the army to quote “Warn the Naboo”.
(Gui-Gon) "We've got to warn the Naboo, and contact Chancellor Valorum."
Hey genius! If you’re going down WITH the army, don’t you think it’s a little too late to warn them ABOUT the army?
And what the fuck are the Naboo gonna do anyways?! They don’t even HAVE a real army, just volunteers.
(Quarsh) "Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army."
So the droid army just rolls in, unchallenged, as expucted. Just like the Nazi’s into France in a little historical event you might’ve heard of? Mmm what was it called, uhm THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.
Anyways, so then for no reason they decide to stow away on different ships.
(Qui-Gon) "Let's split up, and stow aboard separate ships."
Is this guy a fucking retard?! Maybe that’s why they call him Qui-Gon Jin… cuz he’s always drinkin gin. This is a minor point, but what would going down on the planet on separate ships accomplish? 
Let’s think about this.
Number 1: Increase the chances of getting caught by 100%.
2: Have no one else to help you if you get caught and get into a fight with robots.
3: Increase the possibility of getting separated by hundreds, if not thousands of miles by not knowing where the other craft is going to land on the planet.
But thankfully they both aren’t discovered, and they meet up in the same spot in the woods.
Then although the REASON for them going down to the planet was to warn the Naboo about the army, they decide to follow a cartoon rabbit underwater… Why?! Why not just keep moving towards the Naboo city?
Hey Jinnie!! I thought you went down there to warn the Naboo. How is this gonna accomplish that? What was your plan from the beginning when you got down there? Did you PLAN to find a magical underwater craft that would… go through the planet’s core, or did you just plan to run along the surface?
What’s wrong with your faaace?!?! (Thing-in-the-Mouth-Face)
This is the first point they shoulda ditched Jar-Jar. This is also the point when the movie starts to officially fall apart.
This is the moment when the Star Wars saga is now damaged totally beyond repair. The lapses in common sense and logic begin to compound on the movie and now it is broken. I could end this review here, but I’m really just getting started.
I do have to go to traffic court soon though. I accidentally ran over a Korean family with my car…
What is wrong with your faaace?!?! (Thing-in-the-Mouth-Face)
