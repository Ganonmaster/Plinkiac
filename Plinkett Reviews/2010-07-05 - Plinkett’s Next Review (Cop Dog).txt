Palpatine: Lord Plinkett, what is your next review?
Plinkett: Twilight.
Palpatine: What?
Plinkett: Twilight.
Palpatine: The one that's out now now?
Plinkett: No, the first one.
Palpatine: Oh. I have foreseen your next review. It is unavoidable. It is your destiny.
Plinkett: Cop Dog?
Palpatine: What? I can feel your anger.
Plinkett: Look, would you just get out of my bathroom?
Palpatine: I sense great fear in you.
Plinkett: That's not fear you sense in me. That's taco salad.
Palpatine: Now make the review.
Plinkett: No.
Palpatine: Do it.
Plinkett: Stop it.
Palpatine: Do it.
