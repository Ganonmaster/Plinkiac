Mike: Hello, I'm Mike.
Jay: And I'm Jay.
Mike: And today, we're here to tell you about our Patreon.
Jay: That's right, Mike. It's been a while since we talked about it, so why not?
Mike: That's right, Jay. And in case you didn't know, Patreon is a tiered subscription site that we're a part of where you can
access exclusive rlm content like text
updates about what we're working on what
we're shooting maybe even when our next
video is coming out and even movie
recommendations why we see a lot of
movies jay and sometimes we don't make
review videos wrong why not ah yeah we
also post behind the scenes photos
artwork and weird things that even
weirder people send us why would anyone
send us this or this why would you send
us that why did someone send us this
what are we going to do with this why
would we take a photo of it and publicly
let people know that we now have it in
our possession why did I drop out of
medical school and most importantly
outtakes from all of our shows the night
would always end with Suburban sasquatch
well but the other saying how we
discovered it though is we would just
like we'd watch ten minutes of one of
these movies did you want a copy of
vampire assassin
we have several eliminated it ate your
face but it looked like a giant piece of
greasy bacon on a string all right on
the fly around oh I am double-parked
but the reason mr. plated is immortal
not to mention behind-the-scenes videos
to like this one that we just posted
it's about how rich Evans built the new
best of the worst table and it's
fascinating
so come on over and check out our
patreon page the link is posted below or
don't check it out that's fine too we'll
still be uploading our videos to YouTube
yeah mm-hmm I don't really have anything
else to say so here's the end of blood
debts
I wonder which will be the best of the
worst
