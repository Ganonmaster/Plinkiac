Last week, Milwaukee’s Mike Stoklasa—the dude behind those Star Wars prequel reviews—posted a new episode of his Siskel & Ebert-meets-Tim And Eric web series, Half In The Bag. Stoklasa and co-host Jay Bauman take a look at the new Simon Pegg/Nick Frost joint, Paul, and discuss their recent trip to the Toronto Comic Con. Come for the insightful film criticism, stay for the Dustin Diamond interview.
