Plinkett: Hey, everybody. I'm selling out. In fact, I'm selling out while I'm jumping the shark. Check out my webzone for a link to the Great Plinkett Auction on eBay. You can bet on all my personal treasured items like my Titanic popcorn tub, my goddamn phone, my stupid grandkids' Star Wars toys, and some of the actual scripts that I used to make my reviews from. Even props from the fucking flop movie Feeding Frenzy. Why am i selling on my shit? Well, I just got back from my doctor. He said, normally they can operate on a brain tumor, but this one is malignant. So I've only got a little...
Saul: Mr. Plinkett?
Plinkett: What?
Saul: It's Saul, your lawyer.
Plinkett: Oh.
Saul: Listen. 
Plinkett: Uh-huh. Yeah.
Saul: We need to discuss...
Plinkett: Wh-, oh.
Saul: ...a lot better way to, to talk about this situation. Umm...
Plinkett: Oh, oh...Sorry, that was my lawyer. There's no problem at all. Please continue to buy my products, and to visit my webzone. Speaking of web zones and products, there's a new Plinkett e-store with lots of new merchandise, like my new Jumped the Shark t-shirt. It's got mugs, baby bibs, t-shirts, hats, and so much more. Act now. Operators are standing by.
Palpatine: Would you quit selling out? You make me sick.
Plinkett: Hey, don't tell me not to sell out. Look at you with all that bling on, you fucking old leathery-skinned asshole.
Palpatine: You sold out more than George Lucas did, you shark-jumping sellout.
Plinkett: Shouldn't you be dead by now? You're so old.
Palpatine: What do you mean I'm old? We're the same age. We went to the same high school.
Plinkett: Anyway. I mean, at some point you will just die of natural causes, right? I'm getting a little tired of you constantly interrupting me...oh, um...
